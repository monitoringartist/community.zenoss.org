I suspect it was just expensive.<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:38:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; pokui: I'm mounting the ISO as a virtual cd drive on a vm, so the device when I mount it is /dev/sr0<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:39:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: probably<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:39:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; It basically doubles the polls needed each cycle<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:39:49] &lt;Simon4&gt; and then some, since it has to do get/getNext, not many OID's in a request<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:39:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think the best overall solution would be to have alternate snmp plugins available for each thing (interfaces, disks, etc...) that can optionally be used on devices which those change often on<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:40:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; that way you can only use it where necessary<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:40:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; I may take a stab at modifying the filesystem plugin to do what I want<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:43:09] &lt;cgibbons&gt; file system collection could also be less frequent by its very nature i suspect, making the hit less of an issue<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:44:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I think 5 minutes is reasonable for it, in case a drive suddenly massively increases in disk usage.<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:44:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; better to catch it early<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:46:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: What file is actually responsible for the filesystem data collection?&#160; HRFileSystemMap appears to just be for modelling at first glance.<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:47:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah nevermind<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:47:19] &lt;cgibbons&gt; the template + the snmpindex found by that plugin<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:47:30] &lt;cgibbons&gt; so regular ol zenperfsnmp<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:47:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:47:42] &lt;ericenns&gt; anyone on here interested on working on my VMwareDataSource plugin with me<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:47:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, this could be more difficult than I thought then<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:47:55] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: "collector plugins" is a total misnomer <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:48:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: Yeh, lol<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:49:13] &lt;logyati&gt; hello!<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:49:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; hi<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:51:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; pokui: and sorry, I didn't see that you had said "on solaris"...<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:51:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; pokui: I don't actually have access to the solaris servers, the client is being anal about that<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:51:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; pokui: so I'm testing on a Linux VM<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:52:50] &lt;pokui&gt; rmatte: ah. ok. I also realised I'd mis-read your question. Thought you were quering the solaris snmp not the vm snmp.<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:53:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, they are both running net-snmp<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:53:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's pretty much the same<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:58:46] mrayzenoss is now known as mray<br/>[01-Oct-2010 09:59:06] &lt;logyati&gt; im about to install zenoss and a question came through my mind. I have debian lenny 64bit. Should i use the stack installer or the native .DEB package? Whats the difference?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:00:09] &lt;ericenns&gt; stack includes all dependencies and is pretty much standalone<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:01:51] &lt;logyati&gt; ericenns, so, the .bin installer is better?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:02:15] &lt;ericenns&gt; yes in a sense then you could remove anything from your system and still have a running installation<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:02:52] &lt;logyati&gt; hmmm<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:03:04] &lt;logyati&gt; thats good<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:03:07] &lt;logyati&gt; thanks<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:03:11] &lt;ericenns&gt; no problem<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:03:20] &lt;logyati&gt; its easier to backup then, right?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:03:47] &lt;ericenns&gt; I would assume that It should all be contained under a single directory<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:03:58] &lt;logyati&gt; yep<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:04:51] &lt;ericenns&gt; just so know the stack installer stays at 99% for a while so don't kill it just wait<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:07:47] &lt;logyati&gt; ok<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:08:13] &lt;logyati&gt; waiting at 99% <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:08:45] &lt;ericenns&gt; ok cool mine took over 1 hour on a p4 xeon at home<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:20:09] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: would it be an option to write your own device modeller that scans dskDevice?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:20:38] &lt;logyati&gt; ericenns, done <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:20:41] &lt;fragfutter&gt; (1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.2)<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:20:51] &lt;ericenns&gt; awesome<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:20:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; fragfutter: what good is that going to do?&#160; zenperfsnmp is hardcoded to use snmp indexes<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:21:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; fragfutter: hehe<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:21:27] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: dskDevice is explictly defined (including order) in snmpd.conf<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:22:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; fragfutter: Right, but I'm not sure if you're seeing the big picture here...<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:22:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; the problem is that as the filesystems are auto mounted or unmounted on a solaris server, the indexes move up and down for any devices/filesystems below them<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:23:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless you're suggesting actually monitoring the /dev/whatever devices directly, which I wasn't aware was possible.<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:23:09] &lt;fragfutter&gt; i assume you only want to mount a specific set of disks and ignore all automounted ones?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:23:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; fragfutter: yes, I only want to monitor the non-automounted ones...<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:23:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; the problem is that the auto-mounted ones screw with the snmp indexes<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:23:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; as they are mounted and unmounted the snmp indexes for the drives that I do want to monitor change<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:24:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I end up with thresholds kicking off for 1000+% disk utilization<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:24:07] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: if you use dskDevice (which is by default _empty_) you could say in snmpd.conf to only include these<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:24:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; or -100, or whatever<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:24:29] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: and these indexes would not move<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:24:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, but I should just be able to specify ignoredisk to ignore the disks I don't want to monitor<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:24:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's not working<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:25:13] &lt;fragfutter&gt; ignordisk only works for specific tables<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:25:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd rather figure out how to fix that than go off coding some weird thing using a different table<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:25:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; so an ignoredisk won't affect an snmpdf?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:26:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; and even if that's so, I should also be able to use the "disk" option to specify only the things I want to monitor<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:26:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; which also doesn't work<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:26:33] &lt;fragfutter&gt; disk will populate only the table dskDevice<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:26:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I basically want to tune what shows up in hrStorage<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:26:46] &lt;fragfutter&gt; it has nothing to do with the table hrStorage table<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:27:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; so there's absolutely no way to modify the hrStorage table?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:27:13] &lt;fragfutter&gt; afaik no.<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:28:14] &lt;fragfutter&gt; to be sure, i would need to read c-code (and i can't code C <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:29:24] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I'm going to work on coding that this morning, and if I get it working that's one more ZenPack submission from me for the contest<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:35:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:35:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; It honestly shouldn't be hard<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:37:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmmm, one thing is the values that it outputs for total and such are different than hrStorage<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:37:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's going to be a bit of a pain<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:39:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, they do it using an alias from the looks of it, hmmm<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:39:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; usedFilesystemSpace__bytes&#160;

wow, I didn't even know you could do that<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:43:56] * rmatte scratches his head<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:44:17] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; hey ryan<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:44:51] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; i'm getting alerts that zenperfwmi isnt avialible on my remote collectors.. think it'll fix it if i just install the zenpack on the remote collector<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:45:02] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; i thought egors pack deployed the zenpacks, i dunno what happened with it<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:45:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; Parabola|Work: The pack needs to be installed on the remote collector and zenperfwmi needs to be configured like any other daemon<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:45:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; with the local and remote config options<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:46:10] &lt;rmatte&gt;

oh<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:46:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; but in the case of daemons, it's very different<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:46:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; daemons need to actually be installed, running, and configured correctly<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:46:26] &lt;bigegor&gt;

there's no way to automate installation of that pack without starting up zope on the remote collector first<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:47:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then configuring the daemon to connect back to zenhub on the master<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:47:31] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; it does that<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:47:34] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; iirc, lemme check the configs<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:47:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:48:02] &lt;bigegor&gt; zenperfwmi daemon must bu running un master. zenpack get list of running daemons and send config to remote collector.<br/>[01-Oct-2010 10:48:43] &lt;bigegor&gt;

easy fix is to disable monitoring on that drive<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:07:11] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; but not exactly a good long term solution<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:07:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; pokui: nah, my problem is more complex than that<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:08:07] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; what is your problem rmatte<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:08:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; Parabola|Work: just disable monitoring on it and lock it so that monitoring doesn't get enabled on it again<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:08:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; If it's a Linux server, add /mnt/cdrom or whatever to the ignored filesystem names in zProperties<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:09:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; Parabola|Work: my problem has to do with solaris servers which auto-mount/unmount user home directories as people login/out of the server<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:09:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; which messes up the snmp indexes in the hrStorage table<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:09:31] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; ah<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:09:48] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; rmatte,&#160; it was a windows server for me <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:10:00] &lt;rmatte&gt;

nice<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:10:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was wondering why an ignoredisk options wasn't work in snmpd.conf...<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:10:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's because it affects the dskDevice table, not the hrStorage table<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:10:55] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Parabola|Work: no, they mess up the snmp indexes<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:18:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; for instance...<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:18:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you have:<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:18:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; 1: /<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:18:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2: /home/jerry<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:18:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; 3: /home/steve<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:18:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; 4: /var<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:18:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then bob logs in<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:18:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; you end up having...<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:18:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; 1: /<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:18:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2: /home/bob<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:18:54] &lt;rmatte&gt;

so now Zenoss thinks that /home/steve are the values for /var<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:19:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it screws everything up<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:20:32] &lt;xuru&gt; anyone know what would be causing this:&#160; threshold of low CPU idle not met: current value 0.00?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:20:45] &lt;Simon4&gt; xuru: 100% cpu usage<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:21:10] &lt;xuru&gt; hmm<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:21:47] &lt;xuru&gt; Simon4: thanks!<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:21:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; xuru: just disable that threshold<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:22:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's there by default and it's useless<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:22:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; same with the swap space one<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:22:14] &lt;xuru&gt; why is it useless?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:22:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's hardcoded at 1024, it's not dynamic<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:22:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; useless<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:22:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's useless because every server is going to hit 100% CPU from time to time<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:22:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; It'll pick up the odd spike and you'll get alerts several times each day<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:23:07] &lt;xuru&gt; true, but in this case it's been an ongoing issue and it actually was correct<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:23:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, you can keep it if you want, just saying<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:23:28] &lt;Simon4&gt; it's the kind of alert you only want to get if the CPU is pinned for the whole 5 min<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:23:34] &lt;Simon4&gt; vs "snapshot CPU"<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:23:34] &lt;xuru&gt; yeah<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:23:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:23:38] &lt;xuru&gt; that's what I was thinking<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:23:58] &lt;Simon4&gt; the other reason it's useless<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:24:08] &lt;Simon4&gt; is that if a single-threaded app pins a core at 100% you want to know about it<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:24:09] &lt;xuru&gt; looks like puppet was trying to run vmware-config-tools.pl and it got stuck<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:24:18] &lt;Simon4&gt; yet on a multi-core box, that'll only register as say 25%<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:24:27] &lt;xuru&gt; oh, not good<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:24:44] * Simon4 has a to-to to look at a processor modeller/whether net-snmp puts out per-core stats<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:24:52] &lt;Simon4&gt; gah, to-do even<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:25:26] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; rmatte,&#160; cant you rebuild that index<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:25:31] &lt;xuru&gt; also, we have tomcat servers that have the GC setup such that it's taking a single CPU to 100% all the time, and that's normal<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:26:10] &lt;Simon4&gt;

just SERVER_NAME<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:27:35] &lt;Simon4&gt; actually, that will only work if ${SERVER_NAME} is the same as the url<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:27:43] &lt;xuru&gt; anyone using / have had success with the puppet zenpack?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:28:28] &lt;Simon4&gt;

Simon4, it works with the url you said<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:30:49] &lt;logyati&gt; im pasting<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:31:01] &lt;Simon4&gt; right, so the zope bit works, it's just the apache config somewhere<br/>[01-Oct-2010 11:31:05] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt;

ah<br/>[01-Oct-2010 13:45:49] &lt;Orv&gt; How come the ones you monitor aren't running IOS?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 13:45:54] &lt;Orv&gt; just curious...<br/>[01-Oct-2010 13:46:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; No idea, they aren't my switches lol<br/>[01-Oct-2010 13:46:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; they belong to a client<br/>[01-Oct-2010 13:46:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; and probably because they don't feel like migrating the configuration to IOS format then update<br/>[01-Oct-2010 13:46:52] &lt;Orv&gt;

hmmm<br/>[01-Oct-2010 14:37:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; logyati: you're obviously going to have to tune some traps out<br/>[01-Oct-2010 14:37:23] &lt;logyati&gt; and where do i get the snmp trap string inside zenoss?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 14:37:25] &lt;logyati&gt;

if you have tcpdump on the system you can look at the nic to be sure a firewall isn't stepping on it.<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:28:56] &lt;wvcain&gt; On *NIX it goes like this sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 162<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:29:30] &lt;xuru&gt; also, in the event details the agent will be zentrap I believe<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:30:00] &lt;st3v3o&gt; does anyone currently monitor zenoss with another monitoring service like nagios to verify that zenoss processes are running<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:30:03] &lt;xuru&gt; mine came in /Unknown without a component for some reason<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:30:34] &lt;wvcain&gt; Thats the event class not the receiver.<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:30:34] &lt;xuru&gt; st3v3o: I use monit alot for that kind of thing<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:30:47] &lt;st3v3o&gt; do you do it via SNMP with and OID ?<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:31:28] &lt;xuru&gt; no, it's a lot more simple then that<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:31:34] &lt;xuru&gt; monit runs on the same box<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:31:52] &lt;xuru&gt;

ah we are required to have an off site box monitor the monitor system to verify that its up<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:33:12] &lt;xuru&gt; ah, yeah, that wouldn't work then<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:33:23] &lt;xuru&gt;

yeah, you need to remap them<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:48:34] &lt;xuru&gt; probably because it doesn't know what you want them to be I guess<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:49:17] &lt;xuru&gt; What I do is go to the events page select it, and click on the "Map event to class" button<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:49:56] &lt;xuru&gt; if there isn't an event class that you like you can always make another<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:50:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, they'll come in as Unknown by default<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:50:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to map them to the class you want<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:50:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then optionally configure the mapping how you want<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:50:56] &lt;xuru&gt; you would think that it would map it to something like /trap/unknown or something though<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:51:04] &lt;wvcain&gt; I just pointed syslog at Zenoss and added thousands of events to the event log.<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:51:11] &lt;wvcain&gt; now I want to delete them.<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:51:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; xuru: no, that's not the way it's coded<br/>[01-Oct-2010 15:51:26] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you can do it my way<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:30:59] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; just upgrade it and see what happens<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:31:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, are you running 3.0.2 though?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:31:10] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt;

yeah<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:32:21] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; i get that alot<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:32:21] &lt;imeyer&gt; rmatte: why would i do that?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:32:31] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; why wouldnt you<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:32:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; imeyer: because it takes 2 seconds to do<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:32:41] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; who would waste time on setting up encryption and shit to get the deb file<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:32:44] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt;

or you can just grab the stack installer as a .bin, and chmod +x it then run it<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:33:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; imeyer: what's your issue with doing it manually exactly?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:33:17] &lt;imeyer&gt;

and why not just use the stack installer<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:34:45] &lt;Simon4&gt; imeyer: I think you can disable gpg checking on a repo by repo basis for apt?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:34:49] &lt;Simon4&gt;

the end date for the ZenPack contest is the 14th?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:38:48] &lt;imeyer&gt; rmatte: sure it's just a precaution, i just found it curious that there isn't one.<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:39:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; I already have a new pack to submit, and one more that I want to code (trying something new, going to make my own datasource type)<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:39:23] &lt;imeyer&gt; i think i saw it mentioned somewhere as though there used to be one<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:39:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; imeyer: It's possible but I wouldn't know where to look<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:40:04] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; you made some packs? cool<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:40:05] &lt;imeyer&gt; yah, the place it said where it was 404d, so i asked in here <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:40:22] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt;

Parabola|Work: well, I have my updated Cisco Mibs pack that I still have to wrap up and submit, and a newly created pack that I made today for collection Filesystem info from UCD instead of HOST-RESOURCES<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:40:56] &lt;imeyer&gt; i'll ignore gpg if i absolutely have to, but i'd rather not<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:41:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; Parabola|Work: and I've already submitted my Cisco Catalyst pack<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:41:13] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; sec lemme take a look for you<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:41:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; Parabola|Work: My next project is a datasource type that allows you to do mathematical calculations with datapoints<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:41:42] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; cool, but why<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:41:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you'd have 2 datapoints that you want to add together to threshold on (prior to graphing)<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:42:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you'd create a new datasource which allows you to add both of them together and then threshold against it<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:42:14] &lt;imeyer&gt; rmatte: ooo i would looove that<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:42:16] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; cool<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:42:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've wanted that functionality in Zenoss for ages<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:42:27] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; do you have any idea how you're going to wriet it<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:42:32] &lt;imeyer&gt; rmatte: i use graphite for something similar<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:43:20] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; imeyer, : http://dev.zenoss.org/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-zenoss<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:43:27] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt;

Parabola|Work: The pack for collecting filesystem info via UCD instead of HOST-RESOURCES has a few applications.&#160; When you configure what disks to output info for via snmp in the net-snmp config file it only affects the UCD info, not the HOST-RESOURCES info which Zenoss collects from by default...<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:45:06] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: why stop at 2?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:45:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; Parabola|Work: In the case of Solaris with AutoMountFS, filesystems get mounted and unmounted as users login or logout of the server, so it screws up the snmp indexing<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:45:46] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: so it models filesystems out of UCD? or disks?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:45:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:46:05] &lt;Simon4&gt; which one<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:46:06] &lt;Simon4&gt; ?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:46:11] &lt;rmatte&gt;

(in theory)<br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:47:38] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, I got 90% through coding my own one night before finding/using it <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[04-Oct-2010 14:47:45] &lt;rmatte&gt;

yeah, i see that name frequently <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:38:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:38:53] &lt;mray&gt; meh, I'm the drummer<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:39:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; he's being modest<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:39:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; right now i have zenoss for monitoring all sorts of details... and only the employees here have access<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:39:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; he also plays guitar simultaneously<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:39:11] &lt;xuru&gt; lol<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:39:12] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i use cacti to show a handful of graphs to the public<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:39:19] &lt;mray&gt; "What do you call a guy who hangs out with musicians?"<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:39:22] &lt;mray&gt; The drummer<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:39:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:39:51] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'd like to get zenoss to provide the same sort of thing... either 1 account with very limited access to maybe some graph/multigraph reports... or 1 user per customer i have with access to only their device.<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:40:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I disagree, drummers are musicians, my answer to that question would be "The triangle player"<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:40:31] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: I joke because I was a drummer<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:40:41] &lt;mray&gt; Sam-I-Am: so you're using Enterprise?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:40:46] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yep<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:40:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: interesting... the problem is, I don't know if ACLs actually prevent the routines that actually grab the graphs<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:41:16] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; performance and device reports seem to work... but not other stuff<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:41:21] &lt;mray&gt; well, you can use Administered Objects to only allow a user to see certain devices or organizers<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:41:31] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i can add a graph to performance reports and see it via showgraph portlet<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:41:51] &lt;mray&gt; but you want just the report?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:41:58] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ideally just the report<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:42:17] &lt;mray&gt; reportmail could email it to them...<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:42:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; one or more graphs pertaining to their connection to my network... traffic, errors, etc<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:42:41] &lt;mray&gt; I'm not really familiar with where the ACLs fit in in Enterprise, being the Core guy<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:42:53] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; that'd also work, except my users want graphs they can zoom/adjust<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:43:26] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; mray: understood.&#160; thought there might be some interesting zope hacks floating around or something.<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:43:44] &lt;mray&gt; Sam-I-Am: there certainly are<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:43:57] &lt;mray&gt;

is there an easy way to rename a zenpack?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:45:00] &lt;mray&gt; Sam-I-Am: I assume you read through the ACLs in the Extended Monitoring Guide?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:45:14] &lt;rmatte&gt;

had a band in college, played parties and a few shows<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:45:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm sure you could still play if you wanted to<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:45:56] &lt;mray&gt; nothing remarkable<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:46:26] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; mray: it seems fairly vague, at least about reports<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:46:36] * aclark starts alt rock band w/mray<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:46:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; My brother goes to university for guitar (which I didn't even know was possible before he did)<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:46:43] &lt;mray&gt;

Sam-I-Am: yeah, it does look vague&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; Jane's paper at least has more about what that ZenPack is doing under the covers<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:47:24] &lt;mray&gt; since she went into Zope<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:47:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; All of Jane's stuff is good because she goes in to depth<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:47:49] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: our CTO had a masters in guitar I think<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:47:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: nice<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:48:51] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; mray: i'll give it a read and see if it give me some insight... i suspect playing with zope will be the ideal, although possibly grotesque, solution for this.<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:49:21] &lt;mray&gt; grotesque solutions and Zenoss go hand in hand<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:49:23] &lt;mray&gt;

spaghetti code is fun<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:50:03] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; only with the right sauce<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:50:06] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I like spaghetti<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:50:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, spaghetti code == job security<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:50:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; "good luck figuring this !@#$ out when I leave"<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:50:28] &lt;theacolyte&gt; haha, I think that's a myth more than anything<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:50:32] &lt;theacolyte&gt; everyone is replaceable<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:50:39] &lt;theacolyte&gt; they would just rewrite it<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:50:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, I've seen it in action at previous jobs<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:50:46] &lt;theacolyte&gt; (in a way that doesn't suck)<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:50:58] &lt;theacolyte&gt; usually I find that perception is only on the person that actually wrote the code, not on the management side hehe<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:51:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; "Don't touch anything, you'll break it, Shawn set that up and we have no idea how to change it without breaking it"<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:51:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; no joke<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:51:11] &lt;theacolyte&gt; but did that keep him employed?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:51:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; until he went on to a better paying job<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:51:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; so in a sense, yes<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:51:35] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hehe<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:52:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm actually doing work for a client right now, and having to go through crap like that trying to disect everything to move it to a new server<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:52:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; lots of fun<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:52:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; so far I've migrated the CVS server from windows to Linux which was a pain<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:52:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; and migrated their wiki system, which was a pain<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:53:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; now I just have bugzilla and taskzilla to migrate, then I have to figure out this wacky integration they have between bugzilla and CVS<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:53:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then duplicate it<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:53:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; lots of fun<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:53:14] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Sounds like it<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:53:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; I got volunteered to work on that since I'm one of the 3 linux people in my building<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:53:29] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'm still in fix what the last guy did wrong mode at my new job<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:53:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; out of like 100 employees<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:53:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:53:41] &lt;theacolyte&gt; 2 months into it<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:53:58] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Things like... the guy halfassed set all the disk timeouts for our HBA's and VM's<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:54:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:54:14] &lt;theacolyte&gt;

bad bad bad<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:54:50] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hahah and things like this 3 disk RAID 5 group on our IBM array<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:54:54] &lt;imeyer&gt; ah yeah, you can't ignore apt repos that aren't signed<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:54:57] &lt;theacolyte&gt; seriously... 3 disk RAID5?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:55:07] &lt;imeyer&gt; so because it's not signed you can't do apt-get install -y zenoss-stack<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:55:12] &lt;imeyer&gt; wait, 3 disk raid 5?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:55:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; imeyer: there's a flag to ignore that it's not signed though<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:55:19] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah I've got a few of those<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:55:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; imeyer: I remember using it ages ago<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:55:56] &lt;imeyer&gt; yah, but i'd prefer to use a signed repo so that people trust the source<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:56:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's from zenoss.com, how much more trustworthy can it be when it comes to Zenoss<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:56:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:56:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:56:55] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: without the gpg key you can't be sure it is from zenoss.com, that's the point <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:57:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; true<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:57:19] &lt;imeyer&gt; yeah, i want to know that the packages up there are truly zenoss<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:57:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could get crafty and just write your own script that grabs the latest package file<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:57:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; wouldn't take much<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:57:52] &lt;mray&gt; we do publish the MD5s<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:58:07] &lt;mray&gt; but I guess those could be faked too<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:58:21] &lt;xuru&gt; bigegor: you around?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 15:58:34] &lt;imeyer&gt;

yes<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:03:13] &lt;xuru&gt; bigegor: question for ya<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:03:48] &lt;xuru&gt; when I pass in a connection string, what does it use out of that string?&#160; does it use UID and PWD?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:04:03] &lt;xuru&gt; or does it only look at zWinUser and password<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:05:20] &lt;bigegor&gt; if UID=${here/zWinUser} then zWinUser, if UID='somename' then 'somename'<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:05:43] &lt;xuru&gt; hmm... doesn't look like it's picking that up then<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:06:03] &lt;xuru&gt; Login failed for user &lt;zWinUser&gt;<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:06:32] &lt;xuru&gt; and my connection string looks like this:&#160; DRIVER={FreeTDS};dsn=KingSql1;UID=readonly;PWD=xxxxxxx;TDS_Version=8.0;PORT=1433<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:07:11] &lt;bigegor&gt; remove 'dsn'<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:07:30] &lt;xuru&gt; oh yeah<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:08:12] &lt;bigegor&gt; modeler will add 'server' and 'database' options to connection string<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:08:12] &lt;xuru&gt; still using the zWinUser<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:09:39] &lt;xuru&gt; what should be in the zMsSqlSrvInstances?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:09:41] &lt;bigegor&gt; xuru: wait, modeler used zWinUser and zWinPassword properties.<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:09:56] &lt;xuru&gt; yes<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:11:06] &lt;bigegor&gt; if you have only one instance then nothing, if you have more then one then lost of instances names like: Instane1 instance2 instance3<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:11:38] &lt;xuru&gt; ok, cool,<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:12:23] &lt;xuru&gt; so yeah, it's still using the zWinUser/zWinPassword<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:17:56] &lt;bigegor&gt; xuru: is it problem for you?<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:18:06] &lt;xuru&gt; yes, they aren't the same<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:18:15] &lt;xuru&gt; I'm using a database user, not a windows user<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:19:45] &lt;bigegor&gt; you can add windows user to database users<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:20:19] &lt;xuru&gt; I could, but it's not really an option<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:20:28] &lt;xuru&gt; i think I have a fix for you though<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:21:42] &lt;bigegor&gt; you can model your SQL Server one time with Windows account, but monitor with database account.<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:22:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's fine as long as they don't have zenmodel running on regular intervals<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:22:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless they lock it down<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:22:31] &lt;xuru&gt; I think it would be better to have the connection string override it<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:23:03] &lt;xuru&gt; ok, I "think" I got it to work<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:23:27] &lt;xuru&gt; in MsSqlDatabaseMap.py I added this:<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:23:37] &lt;xuru&gt; options = dict([x.split('=') for x in cs[0].split(';')])<br/>[04-Oct-2010 16:24:05] &lt;xuru&gt;

what do you mean "without os"?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:57:17] &lt;makkalot&gt; rmatte: i need manual for plugins that will do that , want to develop plugins<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:57:29] &lt;makkalot&gt; rmatte: embedded devices<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:57:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; makkalot: right, I need to get an idea of what type of data you're wanting to collect via the plugins<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:57:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; just performance data?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:57:59] &lt;pokui&gt; makkalot: how do you talk to the devices? snmp? ping? custom api?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:58:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that too<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:58:25] &lt;makkalot&gt; rmatte: permormance data and also they generate some numbers (something they compute)<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:58:29] &lt;makkalot&gt; pokui: custom api<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:58:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; makkalot: It's simple, enough... the script just needs to output in nagios format...<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:58:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; such as...<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:58:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; |datapoint1=57 datapoint2=98<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:59:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; where datapoint# is the name of the datapoint<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:59:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the number after the = sign is the returned value<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:59:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you just configure that as a command datasource in Zenoss, create the datapoints<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:59:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then you can graph and threshold against them<br/>[06-Oct-2010 10:59:53] &lt;makkalot&gt; rmatte: sounds easy<br/>[06-Oct-2010 11:00:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's not hard<br/>[06-Oct-2010 11:00:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; the template design (graphs, thresholds, datasources) is done in the UI<br/>[06-Oct-2010 11:01:01] &lt;makkalot&gt; rmatte: can i show the data in tables also , to filter data for example for dates and etc<br/>[06-Oct-2010 11:01:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you could have it output like: |CPU=98 Memory=34 Paging=37<br/>[06-Oct-2010 11:01:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; or whatever<br/>[06-Oct-2010 11:02:32] &lt;makkalot&gt; rmatte: i will collect some data in a database and then show it in zenoss in tables is that hard to integrate ?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 11:02:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; makkalot: yeh, that's much more complex<br/>[06-Oct-2010 11:03:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; because then you're getting in to UI skin design, and collector plugin design<br/>[06-Oct-2010 11:03:29] &lt;rmatte&gt;

still working on this Parabola|w - ill keep you posted<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:55:16] &lt;xuru&gt; newmon: I think the next step would be to see if the data source works<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:55:31] &lt;xuru&gt; go to the device that you have the JMX template bound to it<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:55:48] &lt;newmon&gt; ok<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:55:52] &lt;xuru&gt; select the ZenJMX under the monitoring templates<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:56:01] &lt;xuru&gt; you should see a list of Data Sources<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:56:19] &lt;newmon&gt; so far i have HeapMemoryUsage as a data source<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:56:36] &lt;xuru&gt; there should be four of them<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:56:45] &lt;newmon&gt; I am using a locally defined template<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:56:57] &lt;newmon&gt; interesting, i may be using a different template<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:57:10] &lt;xuru&gt; yeah, i would remove the locally defined one<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:57:19] &lt;newmon&gt; ok.<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:57:22] &lt;xuru&gt; and bind it with the ZenJMX template<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:57:28] &lt;newmon&gt; so do i need to reinstall the zenpack?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:57:32] &lt;xuru&gt; that will give you 4 data sources<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:57:34] &lt;xuru&gt; no<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:58:05] &lt;xuru&gt; under the gear menu, there should be a "Remove Local Template"<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:58:19] &lt;newmon&gt; got it<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:58:20] &lt;xuru&gt; or "Reset Bindings" will work as well<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:58:29] &lt;xuru&gt; then select "Bind Templates"<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:58:30] &lt;newmon&gt; ok,im going to bing the ZenJMX template now<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:58:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; no it won't, not if the template is a local copy<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:58:39] &lt;xuru&gt; ah, ok<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:58:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; If it's a local copy you need to remove it, then verify the bindings<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:58:59] &lt;newmon&gt; cool, i now have 4 data sources<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:59:05] * xuru feels nervous with rmatte looking over his shoulder <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:59:12] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you're doing fine, I'm just making the odd correction so that you're aware <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:59:49] &lt;newmon&gt; so im guessing i now need to define each data source, threshold and graph defintion?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 14:59:51] &lt;xuru&gt; it may take a while<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:00:03] &lt;newmon&gt; modeling now<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:00:18] &lt;xuru&gt; newmon: no, you get all that for free... graphs anyway<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:00:25] &lt;newmon&gt; cool<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:00:59] &lt;xuru&gt; you may want to select the datasource, and select the gear in the top bar &gt; View and Edit Details<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:01:05] &lt;newmon&gt; alright, the new graphs have shown up, but so far have not populated.<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:01:12] &lt;newmon&gt; ill take a look at the details<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:01:15] &lt;xuru&gt; I had to put the correct port number in there<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:01:43] &lt;xuru&gt; Down toward the bottom, "Management Port"<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:01:50] &lt;newmon&gt; the modeling mentioned something about a 'attribute error' for the management port<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:01:53] &lt;newmon&gt; i will do that now<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:02:01] &lt;xuru&gt; yeah<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:02:23] &lt;newmon&gt; should protocol be RMI or JMXXP<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:02:26] &lt;xuru&gt; I think that is a bug, becuase it should grab the zJmxManagementPort<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:02:38] &lt;xuru&gt; RMI<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:02:41] &lt;newmon&gt; ok<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:02:46] &lt;xuru&gt; I just left everything else alone<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:03:41] &lt;newmon&gt; cool, ive adjusted the port on the data sources<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:04:01] &lt;xuru&gt; I tried to put something like ${here/zJmxManagementPort} in the management port field, but it wouldn't take it (wanted a number)<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:04:28] &lt;newmon&gt; im being pulled away<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:04:31] &lt;newmon&gt;

I'm not sure how to get around it though<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:07:39] &lt;xuru&gt; It's an issue with ubuntu and debian systems<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:08:03] &lt;xuru&gt; the init scripts fire them off as root, and they change to the tomcat user<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:08:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; why specifically debian based systems?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:08:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:08:24] &lt;xuru&gt; that's fine, but then it doesn't have access to /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd anymore<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:08:35] &lt;xuru&gt; and that's where JMX pulls the info from<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:08:55] &lt;xuru&gt; something about the way the setup the init scripts I think<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:09:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; sounds like<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:09:13] &lt;xuru&gt; course if I change tomcat to run as root, it works fine<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:09:20] &lt;xuru&gt; but I really don't want to do that<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:09:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could just edit the startup script to launch as tomcat<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:09:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; if that's what's needed<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:10:32] &lt;xuru&gt; but then the next upgrade will break initscript again<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:10:51] &lt;xuru&gt; I'd rather not change files that belong from a package if possible<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:11:17] &lt;xuru&gt; now here is another wierd thing...<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:11:37] &lt;xuru&gt; I have a dev system and I tried running tomcat as root just to see if it would work<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:11:54] &lt;xuru&gt; and of course there were permision issues after changing it back to tomcat<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:11:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you could create your own startup script that runs after that one and chmods those procs dirs<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:12:07] &lt;xuru&gt; so I chown'd all the tomcat directories<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:12:27] &lt;xuru&gt; when I started it up from the init scripts, it was running as tomcat and so was /proc<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:12:56] &lt;xuru&gt; rmatte: even root cat chown those<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:13:07] &lt;xuru&gt; they are open file descriptors<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:13:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:13:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmm<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:13:53] &lt;xuru&gt; it's not that much of a show stopper<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:14:23] &lt;xuru&gt;

oh then i can't do that, i never used the stack installer<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:31:39] &lt;QubeZ&gt; i used rpm<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:31:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; then upgrade using rpm<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:31:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; just like you'd upgrade any other rpm<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:31:57] &lt;ericenns&gt; ya the guide covers rpm upgrade<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:32:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:32:06] &lt;QubeZ&gt;

ok<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:53:00] &lt;Simon4&gt; Sam-I-Am: yeah, it's a convenience zenpack to stop you having to click on each interface - makes spotting trends easy<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:53:18] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; now thats handy.&#160; can i configure whats graphed via templates?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:53:43] &lt;Simon4&gt; there are a couple of zProperties that control what bits of an interface are graphed, and how they're ordered<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:53:59] &lt;Simon4&gt; so you can say "give me throughput and errors only"<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:54:07] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; does it support custom graph definitions?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:55:05] &lt;Simon4&gt; no, it's very simple - it just collects the interface graphs you would see under "components" and puts them in one place<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:55:10] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ahhh ok<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:55:40] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so whatever i have in there... i can select which ones might appear with your zenpack<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:55:41] &lt;Simon4&gt; it was the result of a conversation in here once and a need we had at work<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:56:08] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its a really good idea... the people looking at graphs on my stuff always ask what to click<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:56:17] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; under that i can put the stuff they're most likely to need<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:56:35] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; which is more or less just throughput on a handful of interfaces... things like errors and stuff are for the netadmins to pay attention to<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:56:56] &lt;Simon4&gt; well.. this just does interfaces vs any other components, but it's great to just be able to see all the interfaces on one page<br/>[06-Oct-2010 15:56:57] &lt;st3v3o&gt;

then it pukes<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:25:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; right<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:26:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; because it'll try to pull down every route<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:26:06] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; tep<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:26:08] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yep<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:26:37] &lt;Simon4&gt; right.. social time.. night all<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:26:45] &lt;xuru&gt; night<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:26:47] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so, the oids are organized as blah.blah.blah.1.2.3.4<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:26:50] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; Simon4: night, thanks<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:27:07] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; would be nice to be able to filter based on maybe the first few octets<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:27:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:27:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; it just takes some minor craftiness<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:27:25] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; sheeeit, really?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:27:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you talking about filtering traps?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:27:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, you mean filtering routes<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:27:57] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; no, just filtering what routemap pulls during modeling for dependency purposes<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:28:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, you can't do that<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:28:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; damn<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:28:12] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; cant use auto-dependencies without it...<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:28:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; the dependencies don't even work that well anyways<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:28:42] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; might not be super hard to modify it only to grab routes for my two /16 networks<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:28:47] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; oh, boo<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:29:05] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its one of those "things" on my list to test with 3 that didnt work on 2<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:29:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm never able to grab every route to make the dependencies work<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:29:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; you literally need every device in Zenoss<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:29:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; and have all routes pulled down<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:29:35] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i can manage that aside from the internet routing table problem<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:29:42] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; all 320k or so routes <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:29:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; even the smallest gap in topology and it'll complain and not work<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:30:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can tell Zenoss only to pull down local routes, but it still goes over the entire table of routes<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:30:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; it just won't pull them in to the database<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:30:42] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; how do i tell it which routes to pull?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:31:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; There are some Properties...<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:31:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; zRouteMapCollectOnlyLocal<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:31:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; zRouteMapCollectOnlyIndirect<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:31:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; zRouteMapMaxRoutes<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:31:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; those are the only options you have<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:31:54] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:34:18] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; how does it determine a local route?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:34:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; no idea, but it does know the difference<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:35:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; probably based on the OID or something<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:35:47] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm...<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:35:57] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; theres also something called 'ospfroutemap' in the list of plugins...<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:36:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:36:10] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; havent seen that before<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:36:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure exactly what that does<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:36:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I'd imagine it would pull down routes from OSPF<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:36:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; though it's not like there's an eigrproutemap plugin listed there<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:36:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:37:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i suspect so.. will need to investigate further.&#160; if it does ospf only, that'd keep the big honkin' bgp table out of zenoss<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:37:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:37:24] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; just need to figure out how it integrates into zenoss dependency mapping... if at all<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:37:30] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; mmm, so. many. things.<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:37:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just modeler plugin<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:37:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; you apply it against a device or device class<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:37:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; them remodel the device<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:37:52] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:37:54] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; gonna try it<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:38:25] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; just not sure if zenoss will use it for dependencies<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:38:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; If it pulls it down as a route it will<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:39:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; as long as you see routes in the routes component<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:40:53] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; local appears to grab routes defined as 'local' in the router... which seems to be connected<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:41:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:41:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; theres also indirect...<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:42:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; which just means a route to a device through another device<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:43:17] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:43:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; not sure exactly how much zenoss needs to build dependencie<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:43:44] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; not that they'd work, but its something to experiment with<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:43:49] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; on my list of "requests"<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:44:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, they do work in theory, I'm just saying I've never gotten them working<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:57:04] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm, ospfroutemap didnt do anything...<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:57:24] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; also found 'newroutemap' ... cant seem to figure out if it added any new configuration properties.<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:57:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; still see the same 3... indirect, local, max routes<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:57:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; the config properties don't get dynamically added by collector plugins<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:58:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only time they are added or removed is when installing/removing ZenPacks<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:58:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; other than that, what you see is what you get<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:58:42] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ah<br/>[06-Oct-2010 16:58:48] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; well, guess these didnt add anything<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:01:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm, looks like i might be able to hack these plugins<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:02:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I've modified collector plugins on a few occasions<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:02:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's not too difficult<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:03:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; Though I'd recommend copying it to a different name and modifying that instead<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:03:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't modify the actual existing plugins<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:03:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; and after copying it you need to go in and change any instance of the old name in the file to the new name<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:03:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; there should be 3 instances I believe<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:06:16] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hence 'routemap' and 'newroutemap'<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:07:11] &lt;xuru&gt; is it community.wmi.DiskDriveMap that gets you the IOPS graph on the windows boxes?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:08:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; xuru: You're talking about a Windows server?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:08:20] &lt;xuru&gt; I'm using zenoss.snmp.UCDHardDiskMap but I don't see an IOPS graph on my linux box<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:08:23] &lt;xuru&gt; rmatte: yes<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:08:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; wmi is for windows, not Linux<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:08:36] &lt;xuru&gt; I know<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:08:46] &lt;xuru&gt; the windows server has an IOPS graph<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:08:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; Where are you looking for the IOPs graph?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:08:51] &lt;xuru&gt; I wan that for my linux box<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:08:55] &lt;Simon4&gt; xuru: check the hardware tab<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:08:58] &lt;Simon4&gt; not the OS tab<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:09:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; and you'll need to remodel the device<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:09:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you're probably looking at the wrong tab<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:09:27] &lt;xuru&gt; 3.0.2?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:09:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; Hardware in components on the device page<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:09:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; which has replaced the tabs that were in 2.5.2<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:09:59] &lt;xuru&gt; ok<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:10:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; look on the left<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:10:17] &lt;xuru&gt; I don't have a Hardware component<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:10:28] * Simon4 tries it in 3.0.2<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:10:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; how can you not?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:10:40] * rmatte checks 3.0<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:10:45] &lt;xuru&gt; *shrug*<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:11:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm sick of everything being moved around, makes explaining anything 10 times as hard<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:11:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:11:17] &lt;xuru&gt; hehe<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:11:18] &lt;Simon4&gt; xuru: you should get a set of componetns called "Hard Disks" after remodelling<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:11:21] * Simon4 does<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:11:31] &lt;xuru&gt; yes, I have Hard Disks<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:11:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, look at that<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:11:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; those are the physical disks<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:11:46] &lt;Simon4&gt; those _should_ populate graphs with iops, etc<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:11:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; that will give you IOPs<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:12:11] &lt;xuru&gt; ok, that's what I thought, but there is no graph and the type, RPM is blank and size is 0<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:12:19] &lt;xuru&gt; status is unknown<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:12:27] &lt;Simon4&gt; type and RPM is blank on mine too<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:12:33] &lt;Simon4&gt; just giving it 10 min to see if it graphs<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:12:47] * Simon4 hasn't done this in 3 before<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:12:57] &lt;xuru&gt; yeah, it's been about 10 minutes already<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:13:21] &lt;xuru&gt; wouldn't the graph come up anyway though?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:13:25] &lt;xuru&gt; just empty?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:13:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; 15 minutes for graph generation<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:13:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; do you at least see "nan" for the values in the graph?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:13:45] &lt;Simon4&gt; xuru: not until anything has been collected<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:13:58] &lt;xuru&gt; no graph at all<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:14:23] &lt;xuru&gt; I'll wait a while and see what happens<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:14:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; xuru: well, do you have Graphs selected in the dropdown?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:14:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's different sections that you can select<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:14:46] &lt;xuru&gt; rmatte: hehe, yes<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:14:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:15:03] &lt;xuru&gt; I know, you have to ask <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:15:27] &lt;xuru&gt; at least it sees the drives<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:15:39] &lt;xuru&gt; cciss_c0d0p1<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:15:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but you should at least be seeing a graph with "nan" values<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:15:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; since the RRD should have been created on first poll<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:15:55] &lt;Simon4&gt; xuru: no debug events for that device?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:16:46] &lt;xuru&gt; nope<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:17:00] &lt;xuru&gt; I could try modeling it with debug, see if I see anything<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:17:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: maybe it's a template thing?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:17:06] &lt;Simon4&gt; xuru: if you click on a hard disk - and pick "template" from the "Display" drop down<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:17:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; what do you see?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:17:15] &lt;xuru&gt; nothing in the list<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:17:21] * Simon4 also <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:17:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; xuru: are you literally seeing no graph at all, or do you at least see the arrows to navigate right and left through the graph?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:17:28] &lt;Simon4&gt; I wonder if that exists - lemme check<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:17:38] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: I'm seeing no template bound to the component<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:17:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:17:42] &lt;xuru&gt; rmatte: no graph at all<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:18:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; If he's not seeing a graph at all it's a template issue<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:18:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; okay<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:18:10] &lt;Simon4&gt; wierd<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:18:26] &lt;Simon4&gt; in a fresh 3.0.2 install the HardDisk template is only applied under /Server/Windows<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:18:32] * Simon4 wonders who regressed what<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:18:41] &lt;xuru&gt; oh?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:19:01] &lt;Simon4&gt; xuru: I don't think it's you <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:19:11] &lt;xuru&gt; ah, ha<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:19:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: sounds like a trac ticket begging to be opened<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:19:26] &lt;xuru&gt; I'll do an override and see if that works<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:19:43] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: yeah, the only HardDisk template is designed for snmp informant<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:20:07] &lt;xuru&gt; I was wondering why you guys excited about it <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:20:25] &lt;Simon4&gt; wah hey<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:20:30] &lt;newmon&gt; xuru-- so another update<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:20:33] &lt;Simon4&gt; xuru: if yo uoverride it to /Devices<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:20:41] &lt;Simon4&gt; it starts to try and draw graphs<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:20:47] &lt;newmon&gt; i've gone through the rebuild (host, template, configurations, etc)<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:20:55] &lt;newmon&gt; still no graph input.<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:21:13] &lt;newmon&gt; where are the thresholds set, if I don't manually create them?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:21:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm done for the day, be back tomorrow<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:21:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; seeya, thanks<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:21:37] &lt;xuru&gt; rmatte: see ya<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:21:51] &lt;xuru&gt; newmon: there are no thresholds by default<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:22:11] &lt;xuru&gt; newmon: should get it actually graphing something first<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:22:13] &lt;newmon&gt; so what is being 'monitored'?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:22:56] &lt;xuru&gt; well, there is monitoring for historical purposes, and there are alerts<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:23:28] &lt;xuru&gt; because JMX is different in a lot of different shops, you kind of have to set those yourself<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:23:49] &lt;xuru&gt; newmon: that kind of sucks that it didn't work<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:24:00] &lt;newmon&gt;

no prob<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:56:13] &lt;Simon4&gt; you don't need to compile a py file<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:56:28] &lt;Simon4&gt; python automatically picks up any changes and makes the pyc/pyo files<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:56:47] &lt;Simon4&gt; but if you don't change the py it will use the pre"compiled" ones that are there<br/>[06-Oct-2010 17:58:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; got it<br/>[06-Oct-2010 18:02:30] &lt;xuru&gt; Simon4: so is UCDHardDiskMap windows only?<br/>[06-Oct-2010 18:02:43] &lt;xuru&gt;

Error reading value for "cciss/c0d0p6" on 172.22.3.240 (oid .1.3.6.1.4.1.9600.1.1.1.1.15.30 is bad)<br/>[06-Oct-2010 18:03:25] &lt;xuru&gt; I got that part working, but now I get that<br/>[06-Oct-2010 18:03:43] &lt;Simon4&gt; hence the oids in the template I posted the screenshot for are different from the "HardDisk" template in 3.0<br/>[06-Oct-2010 18:04:02] &lt;xuru&gt; oh, sorry, didn't catch that<br/>[06-Oct-2010 18:04:04] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, you'll need to create a new template thatmatches the screenshot I posted, put it in /Devices/Server or similar<br/>[06-Oct-2010 18:04:14] &lt;Simon4&gt; vs overriding the windows one<br/>[06-Oct-2010 18:04:56] &lt;Simon4&gt; I'll open a ticket with zenoss to get it put back tomorrow (it's late here in the uk) but to get it working now you can just add the template manually<br/>[06-Oct-2010 18:05:12] &lt;xuru&gt; yeah, np<br/>[06-Oct-2010 18:12:10] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

I'm one of the 3 Linux experts in an all Windows shop, so I end up dealing with Linux stuff for the odd client<br/>[07-Oct-2010 14:11:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not a regular thing though<br/>[07-Oct-2010 14:12:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm migrating this particular client's CVS server from Windows to Linux<br/>[07-Oct-2010 14:12:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; once of the less pleasant things I've had to do<br/>[07-Oct-2010 14:12:14] &lt;rmatte&gt;

so I need to figure that out<br/>[07-Oct-2010 14:13:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; then I need to migrate a whole bunch of websites and duplicate some integration that they have between the Windows CVS and bugzilla<br/>[07-Oct-2010 14:13:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; lots of fun<br/>[07-Oct-2010 14:13:39] &lt;BKTEC&gt; sounds like it<br/>[07-Oct-2010 14:13:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; luckily today, they are just having a problem with vsftpd on one of their Linux servers<br/>[07-Oct-2010 14:13:52] &lt;rmatte&gt;

when they ask for something*<br/>[07-Oct-2010 15:24:32] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, for sure<br/>[07-Oct-2010 15:24:38] &lt;Simon4&gt; same in a huge corporate<br/>[07-Oct-2010 15:24:41] &lt;Simon4&gt; just that clients = other depts<br/>[07-Oct-2010 15:24:44] &lt;xuru&gt;

?<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:11:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; what OID problem did they have?<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:11:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; I monitor lots of 2800 and 3560s and haven't seen any issues<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:11:17] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; well in the version 2.5 i was have problem with some interfaces<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:11:40] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; and they gitme some incorrects oid<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:11:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's just because those interfaces don't support the specific OIDs that the interface performance template is trying to use<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:11:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; first off, you need to check the type listed for the interfaces<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:11:55] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; mm...<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:12:01] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; i see<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:12:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you need to rename the ethernetCsmacd template to match the type<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:12:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; (case sensitive)<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:12:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then adjust it accordingly<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:12:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have 20+ interface templates<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:12:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; and even then, you'll have to make local copies of the templates and remove the specific OIDs for things like sub interfaces<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:13:04] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; well the problem is simple i dont know how works that.<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:13:14] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; the part of templates i never understand that.<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:14:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just explained it<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:14:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; interface templates get applied automatically if the name of the interface exactly matches the type listed for the interface<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:14:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll see the type in the details for the interface<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:15:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; interface templates are stored under /Devices<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:15:04] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; in the cisco device right ?<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:15:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:15:12] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; yup i got it<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:15:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; this is not a Cisco specific thing<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:15:35] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; is from /Devices ?<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:15:40] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; on zenoss right ?<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:15:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm saying the ethernetCsmacd template that comes with Zenoss is under /Devices<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:16:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to copy that template and then rename the copy to match the type of each type of interface<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:16:13] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; ahhh<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:16:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; and adjust the datasources<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:16:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; that way the appropriate template gets applied to each interface<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:16:49] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; one question , i can copy changing the names ?<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:17:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss is not a piece of monitoring software that you just add devices and go, you need to do development work with it to get it configured correctly<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:17:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, you copy first, then change the name after<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:17:18] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; Ok !<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:17:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll copy it to something like copy_of_whatever<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:17:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you just rename it<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:17:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure you copy it to the same location "/"<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:17:48] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; Ok<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:19:23] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; one question , if i copy the ethernetCsmacd i change the name tehn i can change the oid for monitoing the interfaces what i want ?<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:19:33] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; then*<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:19:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:19:59] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; mm...<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:20:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I usually just stick with what's there and just remove what's not working<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:20:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; some interfaces don't support collection of error statistics, such as software interfaces<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:20:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; error statistics are only useful for physical interfaces<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:20:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; some don't support collection of packet statistics<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:21:25] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; For example i take one ethernetCsmacd for one 2811 " i really have a lot of problem with that router" and i then i change the name, and the third step i change the oid for the correct oid, Right ?<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:21:40] &lt;rmatte&gt;

if you have 20 interfaces with 600+ interfaces on each, it's going to work out to about the same as monitoring 200 Cisco routers<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:49:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; 20 devices, rather<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:49:41] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt;

im monitoring 53 routers 2800 and 85 3560<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:50:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; for instance, every interface counts for 3 datapoints (possibly less)<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:50:49] &lt;JuStIcIa_&gt; i see ! ! !<br/>[07-Oct-2010 16:50:57] &lt;rmatte&gt;

walk it with the -On option<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:56:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; so that it doesn't get translated<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:56:37] &lt;mattish&gt; .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.8.1.101.2 = STRING: OK<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:56:54] &lt;mattish&gt; sorry im checking .2 there .. but .1 gives same output<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:57:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it literally gives a string of OK<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:57:27] &lt;mattish&gt; i can make it give me what string i want, as its a custom script the other end<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:57:34] &lt;mattish&gt; at the mo it gives 'OK' or 'FAIL'<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:57:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only way I can think of via Zenoss would be to write a script that pulls that value<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:57:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then have the script either exit normally if it's OK or exit with an error code if it's not<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:57:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; read up on command datasources<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:58:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; the Zenoss Admin guide covers them<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:58:26] &lt;mattish&gt; ta, just getting confused as to where to start, was alot easier in nagios, but thats so dated now<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:59:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss uses the same concept/format as nagios for command plugins<br/>[08-Oct-2010 12:59:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; trust me, it's not much more difficult<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:01:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; to have an alert generated via a bash script you'd just do something like...<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:01:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; echo "This is the error message I want to see in Zenoss"<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:01:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; exit 2<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:02:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you can just use snmpwalk or snmpget to grab the value, then check it using an if loop, and either exit normally or exit with an error depending on the value<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:02:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; then just create a template and add the script as a command datasource<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:02:49] &lt;mattish&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:02:54] &lt;mattish&gt; ta ill have a read and see what i can do<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:02:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:03:03] &lt;mattish&gt; a point in the right direction helps alot <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/> thankyou<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:03:08] * rmatte nods<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:03:41] &lt;mattish&gt; home time now, thanks again<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:04:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:07:29] &lt;imeyer&gt; rmatte: do you run multiple zenoss instances over latent links?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:08:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; imeyer: define "latent links"<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:08:55] &lt;imeyer&gt; us -&gt; europe<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:09:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only europe monitoring we do is for 1 client<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:09:12] &lt;imeyer&gt; not within the same facility<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:09:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; and we just VPN to their central office in the US then branch out from there<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:09:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; we don't actually have any tunnels going to europe ourselves<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:09:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; so in short, no<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:09:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:09:49] &lt;imeyer&gt; yeah, i'm trying to monitor us and ireland from ec2<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:10:02] &lt;imeyer&gt; and we monitor ireland from us and it's getting on my nerves <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:10:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; why?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:10:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I monitor stuff in ireland, france, uk, etc...<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:10:32] &lt;imeyer&gt; because there is a difference of 100ms for app performance<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:10:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's a bit slow, but it still works<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:10:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just disable zenmodel from running automatically<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:10:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; since that causes major performance issues<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:11:17] &lt;imeyer&gt; yeah, it's when we're measuring response time of our apps that it becomes an issue<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:11:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:11:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; like http response time?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:11:45] &lt;imeyer&gt; so i was going to stand up an instance in ireland to measure just those servers in ireland, and potentially send them back to a master instance<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:11:48] &lt;imeyer&gt; yeah<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:12:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could do that, or you could rig up some sort of curl script on a linux server over there, and just have Zenoss ssh in and execute it from there, then graph the stats<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:12:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; would be a bit less complex than setting up a whole new instance<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:12:42] &lt;imeyer&gt; ah that's true<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:15:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wrote a script to dump all syslog events from Zenoss but it's taking forever lol<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:16:55] &lt;xuru&gt; rmatte: hey, can I have a look at that script?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:18:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; xuru: http://fpaste.org/Lfhk/<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:18:18] &lt;xuru&gt; rmatte: sweet, thanks<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:18:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:18:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's quite slow since it's using the API instead of directly going in to MySQL<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:18:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll probably write another that just accesses MySQL directly at some point<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:18:59] &lt;xuru&gt; yeah, I just wanted to do something similar, so it's good reference <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:19:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:19:44] &lt;xuru&gt; unfortunatly I think I have to completely blow away zenoss, and start over <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:19:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hate how python outputs to files though<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:20:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; it outputs in large chunks, and seems to do nothing for long periods of time<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:20:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you get a flood of data<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:20:38] &lt;xuru&gt; you can tell it not to buffer<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:20:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; how?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:21:00] * xuru tries to remember now<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:21:23] &lt;xuru&gt; I know you can do fd.flush() to flush it right away, but I know you can set it to not buffer<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:23:00] &lt;xuru&gt; ah, that was it<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:23:13] &lt;xuru&gt; you can use the -u switch to python to make it not do buffering<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:23:26] &lt;xuru&gt; or set PYTHONUNBUFFERED<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:23:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:24:11] &lt;xuru&gt; or Wrap sys.stdout in an object that flushes after every write<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:24:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you're looking at the same page that I am <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:24:59] &lt;xuru&gt; hehe<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:25:09] &lt;xuru&gt; I remember having to use the -u though<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:25:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; apparently I can just specify the buffer size as 0<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:25:22] &lt;xuru&gt; when I was writing an interactive command line app<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:25:36] &lt;xuru&gt; kind of looks that way<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:25:41] &lt;xuru&gt; myFile= open( "a.log", "w", 0 )<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:25:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; sys.stdout = open("syslog-dump.csv", 'a', 0)<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:25:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; in my case<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:26:03] &lt;xuru&gt; yep<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:26:45] &lt;xuru&gt; gah, I keep getting "AttributeError titleOrId"<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:26:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just restarted the script, we'll see if that works<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:27:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; when did you start getting that error?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:27:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; where are you seeing it?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:27:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; and can you paste a full traceback?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:27:49] &lt;xuru&gt; 1) this morning<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:27:57] &lt;xuru&gt; 2) the main event view<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:28:14] &lt;xuru&gt; 3) nope, I see it in the popup thingy<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:28:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:28:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; check the log files<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:28:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; see if there's a full message in one of them<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:28:33] &lt;xuru&gt; If I apply a filter, I don't get it anymore<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:28:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; It probably has something to do with 1 specific event<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:29:02] &lt;xuru&gt; yeah, I'm tailing all the log files in another window, and there is nothing<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:29:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:29:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; you didn't upgrade recently did you?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:29:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, does it only say "AttributeError titleOrId", or does it give anything else?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:29:58] &lt;xuru&gt; I think it started after I deleted some events in the event view for a device, then I hit the "view it in the events window" button.<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:30:20] &lt;xuru&gt; when I hit the clear filters menu item, it started doing that<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:30:25] &lt;xuru&gt; just that<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:30:33] &lt;xuru&gt; and no, I installed it as 3.0.2<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:30:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:30:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmm<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:31:10] &lt;xuru&gt; I did a backup, but I *really* don't want to go though all those little tweaks I did<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:31:20] &lt;xuru&gt; be doing a complete reinstall<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:31:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; you've tried restarting Zenoss?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:31:50] &lt;xuru&gt; yes<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:31:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you tried a reindex in zendmd?<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:32:04] &lt;xuru&gt; the box as well (unrelated, but yeah)<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:32:07] &lt;xuru&gt; yep<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:32:13] &lt;xuru&gt; let me think<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:32:27] &lt;xuru&gt; The first time I did a reindex it failed iwth a traceback<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:32:32] &lt;xuru&gt; the second time, it worked<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:32:48] &lt;xuru&gt; that was yesterday, so I don't have the trace back<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:32:52] &lt;xuru&gt; hold up<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:32:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; just that error alone is useless, usually there's something trailing the error explaining what function it's refering to<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:32:56] &lt;xuru&gt; I just saw a trace back<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:33:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; strange that you're not able to see it<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:33:09] &lt;xuru&gt; ok, this is it<br/>[08-Oct-2010 13:33:17] &lt;xuru&gt;

is there a good way to have zenoss monitor linux logs for key events?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:46:59] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; eg: my /var/log/messages has some info like "zeus mpt-statusd: detected non-optimal RAID status"<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:47:04] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt;

Good afternoon<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:49:30] &lt;tiredofme&gt; i have a few questions regarding zenperfwmi and distributed collectors<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:50:02] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; ask away man<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:50:13] &lt;tiredofme&gt; i've setup a remote collector, its able to talk to the master hub, graphs display correctly<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:50:33] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; Alright, Question 1: did you use Egors distributed collector zenpack<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:50:46] &lt;tiredofme&gt; the only issue is that graphs from wmi sources do not update, in fact they display no data at all<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:50:49] &lt;tiredofme&gt; no<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:51:04] &lt;tiredofme&gt; i followed another guide<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:51:06] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; alright, when you model a device that was added on the remote collector<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:51:11] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; does the WMI information show up?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:51:17] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; or is WMI data not being pulled<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:51:32] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; ie, disable SNMP on the /CIM/WMI class, and remodel, see what you get<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:51:54] &lt;tiredofme&gt; ok, let me do that<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:51:55] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; wait, are you using egors WMI data / perf zenpacks<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:51:58] &lt;tiredofme&gt; yes<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:52:00] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; okay good<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:52:19] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; let me know if WMI data pulls when you remodel<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:53:20] &lt;tiredofme&gt; by disabling snmp on /cim/wmi do you mean remove all snmp modeler plugins or set zSnmpMonitorignore to true? or both?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:54:10] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; the latter<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:54:26] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; The reason i'm asking you to do this is to see if WMI data is even being collected/ sent back by the remote collector<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:54:40] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; without SNMP and WMI you wont get anything useful <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:55:07] &lt;tiredofme&gt; ok remodeling now<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:56:05] &lt;tiredofme&gt; i don't see any wmi data being pulled<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:56:15] &lt;tiredofme&gt; other than 2010-10-13 11:55:42,000 ERROR zen.WMIClient: Received NT code 0x80041010 from query: SELECT * FROM Win32_Product<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:56:24] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; Alright<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:56:42] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; first think to check, make sure "monitor" and "Hubhost" are set correctly in the configs<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:56:48] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; Do you know where / how to do this<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:56:58] &lt;tiredofme&gt; yes<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:57:07] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; okay<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:57:12] &lt;tiredofme&gt; all conf files are set accordingly, even zenperfwmi<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:57:18] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; do you have ports 8080 and 8081 open?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:57:34] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; open on the remote collector that is<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:57:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; Ok, since some people in here are much better at python than I, what would be the easiest way to go about doing the following... If I have a variable that is an expression such as "$datasource1 + $datasource2 / $datasource3" and turn it in to "d.getRRDValue('datasource1') + d.getRRDValue('datasource2') / d.getRRDValue('datasource3')"<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:58:16] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; rmatte, i'm not sure mate, i know very little python <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:58:22] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; you just want a shorter statement?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:58:23] &lt;tiredofme&gt; checking now<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:58:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:58:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; I want to replace anything that starts with $ with the actual function to retrieve rrddata<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:58:44] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; oh i misread what you said then<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:58:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; basically $datasource1 becomes d.getRRDValue('datasource1')<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:59:04] &lt;tiredofme&gt; netstat -an | grep "LISTEN" shows that no service is listening on 8080 or 8081<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:59:24] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; tiredofme, odd<br/>[13-Oct-2010 11:59:59] &lt;tiredofme&gt; however, i can see data being graphed from a nagios plugin thats running on the remote collector<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:00:51] &lt;tiredofme&gt; 8091 is listening though<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:01:12] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; maybe it was 8090 and 8091<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:01:18] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; im sorry i have a bad memory sometimes<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:01:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, I think I might have figured it out...<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:01:29] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; the only thing i remember, is that egor had me open an additional port<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:01:36] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; i had like 8091 open and he had me open 8090<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:01:57] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; rmatte,&#160; cool i was googling it for you trying to figure it out<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:02:06] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; anytime $datasource* shows up<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:02:08] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; or just 1 2 and 3<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:02:35] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; replacement_field maybe?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:02:51] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; hrm that only works on strings<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:03:04] &lt;tiredofme&gt; ok, so other than punching through 8090, is there any other configuration required? i.e changing anything in zenperfwmi.conf (as it stands, the only thing in zenperfwmi.conf are the respective monitor and hubhost entries<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:03:17] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt;

hmmm ok, i'll give that a shot<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:03:59] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; remember even if WMI starts working, graphs take a while to show up<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:04:02] &lt;Parabola|Work&gt; 15min or so<br/>[13-Oct-2010 12:04:06] &lt;tiredofme&gt;

hum<br/>[13-Oct-2010 14:52:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:36:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; Almost done this pack, it's going to rock so much ass lol<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:42:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, another thing to figure out, how to have the name of the datapoint automatically renamed when the datasource is renamed<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:42:21] &lt;klinstifen&gt; afternoon all<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:42:37] &lt;klinstifen&gt; anyone ever have issue where zenoss stops listening on 8080<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:43:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; klinstifen: that used to happen occasionally for me before Zenoss 2.5<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:43:33] &lt;klinstifen&gt; seems to be happening now for me on 3.0.2<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:55:42] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: whats your pack do?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:56:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: It's a new datasource type called FORMULA<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:56:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; Basically, you create a FORMULA type datasource, and in the datasource properties you can specify a formula<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:56:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; which would be something like<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:57:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; $datapoint1 + $datapoint2 / $datapoint3<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:57:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then that datapoint becomes the result of that every polling cycle<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:57:35] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; can they come from different devices?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:57:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; Only having RPN available when graphing is too limited<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:57:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:57:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's limited to the same device<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:58:00] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah, rpn is meh<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:58:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; RPN is fine for graphing, but it's useless for things like thresholds<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:58:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I prefer to threshold against memory utilization rather than available memory<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:58:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; but if a device only provides available memory and total I'm screwed right now<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:58:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; with this new datasource type I'll be able to make my own utilization datasource<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:59:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's just one of many possible applications<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:59:33] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yep<br/>[13-Oct-2010 15:59:38] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; sounds cool<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:00:05] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i have some ideas for zenpacks, but i'm not much of a coder<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:00:13] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; although some of these things might already exist somewhere<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:00:57] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; does anyone know what zenoss does if it loses connectivity with a collector?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:03:38] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; kinda wondering if it'll behave or set everything on that collector as down<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:03:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; no ideas, I've never tested that<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:04:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd imagine you won't get alerts for the devices<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:04:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; since the events are actually generated in the daemons and then sent to zenhub<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:06:25] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ahh, that makes sense<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:07:40] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; also be nice if autodiscovery could place devices into the correct groups or systems based on something or other<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:09:33] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'll have about 500 devices to add to this new install, so if it could automatically place the devices by hostname or IP... awesome.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:13:12] &lt;bigegor&gt; Sam-I-Am: look at this: docs/DOC-8508<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:15:36] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; bigegor: oooh, that looks nice<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:40:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm out, later olks<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:41:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; folks*<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:42:39] &lt;xuru&gt; damn, missed him<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:42:48] &lt;xuru&gt; talk about bad timing hehe<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:44:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; heh<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:44:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; anyone here familiar with event mappings/transforms in 3.x?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:44:45] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; cant seem to get the one described for interface status polling working<br/>[13-Oct-2010 16:46:04] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; at least its not changing the event summary<br/>[13-Oct-2010 18:15:11] &lt;cgibbons&gt; "math is hard!"<br/>[13-Oct-2010 18:33:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: transforms are the same between 2.5 and 3.0<br/>[13-Oct-2010 18:33:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it's not working double check the code<br/>[13-Oct-2010 18:33:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure you didn't paste it wrong or something<br/>[13-Oct-2010 18:35:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; man, how the hell can people do template development with 3.0?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 18:36:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've been working with it for 5 minutes and I'm already ready to tear my hair out<br/>[13-Oct-2010 18:36:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm just trying to create a template at the /Devices level, but when I go to do it, and click on the dropdown to select the template path the loading icon just spins and spins<br/>[13-Oct-2010 18:36:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; until I eventually get a Server Exception<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:22:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; woohoo, the pack is finally done, works in both 2.5 and 3.0.&#160; I'm just testing some graphing.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:23:41] &lt;aclark&gt; w00t<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:31:08] Parabola is now known as tanknspank<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:31:13] tanknspank is now known as Parabola<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:31:22] Parabola is now known as robyr<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:31:48] robyr is now known as Parabola<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:34:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; mhmmm, I go to edit a graph point and the save button remains deactivated<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:36:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice, so I can't edit graphpoints and I can't create templates<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:41:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, there's a bug for me to file tomorrow<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:41:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:42:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, I see what the problem is<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:42:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; the name field isn't being auto-populated with the name of the graphpoint<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:52:56] &lt;imeyer&gt; yah that reminds me to file a bug against the max/min Y fields not accepting float values<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:53:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, there are so many little bugs, especially to do with template editing<br/>[13-Oct-2010 19:53:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; since it's not a commonly accessed part of the UI<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:05:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; Well, I have 3 ZenPacks to submit tomorrow<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:52:52] &lt;Orv&gt; rmatte: Which ones?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:53:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; ZenPacks.Nova.UCDFileSystemMap, ZenPacks.Nova.Cisco.Mibs (Update), ZenPacks.community.FormulaDataSource<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:55:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; I already have my Catalyst (CatOS) ZenPack submitted too<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:57:54] &lt;Orv&gt; Cool. Congrats<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:58:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; thanks<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:58:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; the FormulaDataSource pack is the best one<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:58:35] &lt;Orv&gt; I'll have to check it out :-)<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:58:47] &lt;Orv&gt; What's the "Nova" for?&#160; I'm not familiar with that.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:59:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's the company I work for<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:59:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; Nova Networks<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:59:07] &lt;Orv&gt; Ah - OK.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:59:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I put that for anything that I code purely at work<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:59:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; the FormulaDataSource pack was coded mostly on my own time<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:59:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I used the community tag<br/>[13-Oct-2010 20:59:48] &lt;Orv&gt; What will it provide?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:00:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; It provides a new datasource type called FORMULA<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:00:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; what you can do with that is...<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:00:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; you create a FORMULA datasource, and you can specify a "Data Formula"<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:00:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can specify integers and datasources<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:01:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if I had 2 datasources that I wanted to add together, I'd set the formula to $datasource1 + $datasource2<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:01:10] &lt;Orv&gt; So, a means to do math on information Zenoss retrieves?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:01:14] &lt;Orv&gt; I see.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:01:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the forumula datapoint becomes the result of those 2<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:01:30] &lt;Orv&gt; Very nice.&#160; I can see where that would be useful.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:01:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I mean, you can already use RPN for graphing, but it's useless for things like thresholds<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:01:42] &lt;Orv&gt; Did you have a specific itch you need to scratch with that?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:01:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a feature that I've wanted for ages<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:01:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:01:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:02:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; some devices only provide total memory and available/free memory via WMI<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:02:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; graphing and threshold against memory utilization is a lot easier/cleaner than doing it against free memory<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:02:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; so that was my inspiration for it<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:02:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it has infinite applications<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:03:00] &lt;Orv&gt; Cool.&#160; How many hours do you think you put in on it? (the pack)<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:03:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; sorry, not via WMI, via SNMP<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:03:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; I meant to say<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:03:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; about 10 hours total<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:03:09] &lt;Orv&gt; I knew what you meant :-)<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:03:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's my first time writing a datasource<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:03:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it was an experience<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:03:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; ericenns helped a ton<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:03:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; he provided me with a copy of his VMwareDataSource pack for reference<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:03:41] &lt;Orv&gt; Excellent.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:03:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I worked off of that<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:04:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; I gave him feedback on fixing his pack to work with Zenoss 2.5<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:04:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it worked out both ways hehe<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:04:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I made sure the pack works with both 2.5 and 3.0<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:05:27] &lt;Orv&gt; Very tidy :-)<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:06:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh well, it scores extra points in the contest that way, and it's of benefit to me since I'm currently using 2.5 in production but plan to upgrade to 3.0 eventually<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:06:31] &lt;Orv&gt; Cool.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:06:32] &lt;Orv&gt; brb<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:06:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:10:27] &lt;Orv&gt; back - wife wanted to show me something on TV :-)<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:10:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:11:14] &lt;Orv&gt; (Took the day off)<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:11:26] &lt;Orv&gt; Got a tour of a place I might go work for next year.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:11:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:11:44] &lt;Orv&gt; Yeah, well, current job ends at the end of this year :-/<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:11:51] &lt;Orv&gt; So, hoping for continued employment.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:12:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:12:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; contract?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:12:28] &lt;Orv&gt; Nope - tossed to the curb&#160; :-(<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:12:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, lame<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:12:41] &lt;Orv&gt; weird story.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:12:43] &lt;Orv&gt; Yeah.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:12:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; guess we won't be seeing you around here much then unless the new job involves zenoss lol<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:13:00] &lt;Orv&gt; Well, it might -<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:13:30] &lt;Orv&gt; They have a whole 'monitoring' group that has spend 100s of thousands of dollars on monitoring, and all the screens are still dark, 18 months later :-/<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:13:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:13:45] &lt;Orv&gt; The linux sysadmins are ready to rebel and put in their own monitoring, just in self-defense.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:13:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; I could fix that with Zenoss in like a week at this point<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:13:56] &lt;Orv&gt; Senior guy wants Nagios, but I might demo Zenoss for him.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:14:07] &lt;Orv&gt; rmatte: Yeah - I think it would take me a month :-D<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:14:10] &lt;Orv&gt; But, still.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:14:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; Nagios would take you a year lol<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:14:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's too complex<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:14:47] &lt;Orv&gt; I'm familiar with Nagios and yeah, it's got lots of nooks &amp; crannies, that's for sure.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:14:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:15:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I looked at groundworks/nagios and wanted to shoot myself pretty quickly<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:16:08] &lt;Orv&gt; :-)<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:16:24] &lt;Orv&gt; Well, when I started using it about 5 years ago, it was pretty much the best game in town.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:16:39] &lt;Orv&gt; Things have changed, though.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:16:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss has been the best game in town for well over a year in my opinion<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:17:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I started using Zenoss at version 2.3.2 and loved it<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:17:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, that would have been almost 2 years ago<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:17:35] &lt;Orv&gt; Yeah.&#160; When I looked at it about 3 years ago, I couldn't even get it installed.&#160; I might not have worked at it a lot, but I had Nagios running at that time, and didn't pursue it any more.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:17:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:17:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's come a long way<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:25:26] &lt;willwh&gt; I have to agree<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:25:35] &lt;willwh&gt; running a little bit of an aged install at work (2.5.0)<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:25:40] &lt;willwh&gt; but it is reaking awesome <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:25:43] &lt;willwh&gt; freaking*<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:25:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should upgrade to 2.5.2, 2.5.0 was a POS<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:26:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; MAJOR bugs in it<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:26:03] &lt;willwh&gt; rmatte: I know... but I'm running a jumpbox deploy..<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:26:12] &lt;willwh&gt; which was installed via deb<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:26:22] &lt;willwh&gt; so I am confident on being able to upgrade it<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:26:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; so, just upgrade it lol<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:26:36] &lt;willwh&gt; just grab the bin and go?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:26:42] &lt;willwh&gt; I guess I should give it shot<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:26:57] &lt;willwh&gt; the only little issue I am going to have moving forward is no free snmp informant for win2k8<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:27:02] &lt;willwh&gt; and their licensing is just insane<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:27:10] &lt;willwh&gt; I guess maybe have to use WMI<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:27:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; why do you need snmp informant?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:27:32] &lt;willwh&gt; I guess don't really, just some extra useful info<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:27:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I made ZenPacks to provide cpu/memory info from standard snmp<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:28:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; and everything else works fine<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:28:31] &lt;rmatte&gt;

though the .deb is just the stack installer wrapped up, so you can technically use the .bin too<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:35:17] &lt;willwh&gt; oh, nono<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:35:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you might as well just use the deb if that's what you did before<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:35:24] &lt;willwh&gt;

trust me, 2.5.0 was garbage<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:37:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll even pass you some patch numbers that you can apply after the install<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:37:12] &lt;willwh&gt; I can't use aptitude to upgrade with their debs<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:37:14] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

is 3 not stable yet?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:41:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; by the way, there was a memory leak in rrdtool in 2.4 which isn't present in 2.5<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:41:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; upgrading to 2.5 will make your instance infinitely more stable<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:41:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; grrrrrr, I hate vpnc for linux<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:41:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; POS<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:42:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; keeps resetting the tunnel<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:42:07] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i wonder if someone will backport the coming patches for 3 to allow use of rrdcached<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:42:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's the actual tool itself<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:42:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; it has nothing to do with zenoss code<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:43:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; oh, renderserver doesnt have to understand it?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:43:15] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; and maybe snmpperfd<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:43:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; the memory leak is actually in rrdtool itself in the version that was included with 2.4<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:43:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll just continuously eat memory<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:43:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hated 2.4 for that<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:43:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; anyways...<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:43:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; upgrade to 2.5.2 and apply the following patches<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:44:06] &lt;rmatte&gt;

it runs beautifully<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:44:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; certainly much better than 2.4.x did<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:45:29] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i think the folks at work planned to do a clean install of 3 since theres a just of junk in 2.4... but i'll bring up 2.5.2<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:45:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I used to have to restart my 2.4.x instances almost weekly<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:45:38] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; funny thing is i'm the network engineer <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:45:49] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; 2.4 has been stable... just slow at times.<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:45:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I had 2.5.2 running for over 3 months without a restart on 14 different servers<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:46:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's infinitely morestable<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:46:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; more stable*<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:46:28] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; how many devices are you monitoring?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:46:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it's a lot quicker<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:46:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; 400+ on 1 server<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:46:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; 100+ on the rest<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:47:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; basically almost 2k devices<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:47:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; routers, witches, servers<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:47:37] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'll probably have about 500 devices, 470 or so are network devices<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:47:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; switches rather<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:47:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that's on one instance<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:48:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; on my 400+ instance the upgrade from 2.4 to 2.5 was amazingl<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:48:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; performance increased by a huge amount<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:48:40] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; do your instances run on vms or bare hardware?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:48:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; especially with those patches<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:48:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; vms<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:48:54] &lt;rmatte&gt;

either way, upgrade to 2.5.2 with those patches, you won't be sorry you did<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:52:52] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; my org focuses on network stuff... so its often hard to justify systems since they dont bring in much money to cover them<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:52:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; sometimes, but the server monsters eat it<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:53:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; understandable<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:53:05] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: you got a page listing those patches?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 21:53:16] &lt;rmatte&gt;

but not even enough to get themselves in trouble<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:18:52] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; lol<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:18:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll just randomly generate events saying "You're only getting younger"<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:18:58] &lt;willwh&gt; and that is the glue holding a lot of stuff together<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:19:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; does that work?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:19:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; willwh: we're an all windows shop, there are 3 *nix guys in the building<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:19:42] &lt;willwh&gt;

hahaha<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:20:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; willwh: not really, I prefer it that way, let the windows admins go wild, it just created more value for us *nix guys<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:20:20] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; put entire organization into maintenance..<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:20:21] &lt;willwh&gt; this is true...<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:20:32] &lt;willwh&gt; rmatte: you played with nginx much?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:20:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: black tuesday as they say in the windows world<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:20:48] &lt;willwh&gt; I was looking at benchmarks for various webservers serving different types of content<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:20:52] &lt;rmatte&gt;

think its possible to write a zenpack to put individual interfaces on a network device into maintenance rather than the whole device?<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:23:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; or other hackery...<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:23:20] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I am actually enjoying using git, a lot..... although... at work, sourcegear vault<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:24:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I saw the code for the integration, it made my head spin<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:25:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I'm a subversion guy<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:25:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; CVS is a nightmare<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:25:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; though git looks really nice<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:25:44] &lt;willwh&gt; it's nice to use from a user standpoint, and I imagine it's ok for "the admin" - or whoever deals with merges etc etc etc<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:25:47] &lt;willwh&gt; but<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:26:00] &lt;willwh&gt;

coming from the network world thats pretty much what i see/use<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:27:44] &lt;willwh&gt; (I am guessing this must be a bug in 2.5.0)<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:27:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; Yeh, I come from a heavy network world lol<br/>[13-Oct-2010 22:27:53] &lt;willwh&gt;

yes.<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:20:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I agree, that's a really basic feature that should have been implemented<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:20:37] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; i found a script on the forumsfor it<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:20:45] &lt;Parabola|W&gt;

I have mine set as 60k on one of my servers<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:37:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; so yeh, 25k is fine<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:37:17] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:37:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; what are you seeing in zope.log?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:38:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I typed the "it can't be something ridiculously high" before I read your "25k"<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:39:06] &lt;OiPolloi&gt; i just set mine to 50k and it's working fine, apparently<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:39:49] &lt;OiPolloi&gt; one more thing: each time i restart zenoss, and sometimes when i'm doing something intensive, i get a few heartbeat events<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:39:55] &lt;OiPolloi&gt; is this normal?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:40:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; OiPolloi: ignore those<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:40:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; They are basically useless since they are overly-sensitive<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:40:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's something that needs to be fixed<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:40:49] &lt;OiPolloi&gt; yeah, i thought it was something like that... because everything seems to be working fine, even when I get those<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:40:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, they won't affect anything<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:44:39] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; you can clear your heartbeats<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:44:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, but they'll just come back<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:44:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's pointless<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:45:00] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; offtopic: anyone in here ever play bioshock? my fiance just finished her graphite sketch of the little sister<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:45:06] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; and she framed it<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:45:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; Parabola|W: yeh, I played it a bit<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:45:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:45:24] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; http://imgur.com/xAAd0.jpg<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:45:27] &lt;Parabola|W&gt;

yup<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:50:45] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; i told her next i wanted a big daddy <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:51:07] &lt;rmatte&gt;

good<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:56:16] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; is there a way to model more than one device at a time?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:56:17] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; like, a group<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:56:25] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; remodel, i mean<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:56:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; in 3.0 it's simple<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:56:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; just ctrl-click on all the devices you want to remodel<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:56:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; then select to remodel them<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:57:40] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; thats what i thought, just not seeing where the remodel option is hiding<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:57:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm weird, hold on, let me look<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:58:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, I could have swore there was an option for that<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:59:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can always just run zenmodel from the commandline<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:59:16] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rue<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:59:18] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; true<br/>[14-Oct-2010 12:59:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think there's an option to specify a group<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:00:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wish they'd just add it as a UI option<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:00:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, you could technically add it to commands<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:00:40] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i suspect it would go under 'action'<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:00:41] &lt;fus10nx&gt; Is there any reason why my CPU aggregate reports stopped working on the 11th and i've had no data since then? I did upgrade to 3.0.2 but that was the 12th - any reason why all sites would stop reporting that<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:00:44] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; with other related items<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:01:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; fus10nx: are they seeing their data?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:01:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; Advanced -&gt; Commands -&gt; Create a new one called model, and make it run: zenmodel run -d ${device/id}<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:01:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you'll be able to select the devices in the group and run that command<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:01:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; which will model all of them 1 by 1<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:01:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; little workaround<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:05:20] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; awesome, thx<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:07:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:10:48] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; parabola's famous pro tips #23<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:11:02] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; If your zenoss VM starts running like crpa, check to make sure someone else didnt decide it only needed a GIG of ram<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:11:08] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; &lt;/protip&gt;<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:11:20] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; crpa is crap<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:11:45] &lt;imeyer&gt; Parabola|W: do you have multi-graph reports with remote collectors?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:11:51] &lt;imeyer&gt; rmatte too ^^<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:12:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't use remote collectors in production right now<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:12:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; st3v3o: go in to zendmd<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:13:05] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; i dont do any reporting<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:13:09] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; or havent had a need yet<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:13:13] &lt;imeyer&gt; ah<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:13:46] &lt;imeyer&gt; i keep getting nan for remote devices<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:15:36] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; hm<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:15:45] &lt;imeyer&gt; but not remove devices on their own.. only if i have local/remote devices on the same graph<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:15:48] &lt;imeyer&gt; it's odd<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:25:35] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; anyone here good with expect scripting?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:25:40] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; i need to verify that i wrote this right<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:26:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; imeyer: probably because the graphs are generated by zenrender, and zenoss isn't able to generate a graph from 2 different instances of zenrender<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:26:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's the remote zenrender and the local zenrender<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:26:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can't have them both generate 1 graph<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:26:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the values would have to be passed to the local zenrender somehow<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:26:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; remote collectors aren't as well supported in core as in enterprise<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:27:13] &lt;imeyer&gt; that makes perfect sense <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:28:08] &lt;imeyer&gt; so in theory i could have an rsync job between the two<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:28:16] &lt;imeyer&gt; but, that seems weird and hacky<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:28:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:29:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; the proper way would be to code something to allow the 2 instanced of zenrender to coordinate with each other, which is probably what they did for enterprise<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:29:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that's a lot of dev work<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:29:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; instances*<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:29:28] &lt;imeyer&gt; yeah<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:37:32] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; yeah back to 0.07 on load<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:37:43] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; thanks for making my VM swap like a mofo guys<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:37:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:38:06] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; would explain the horrid performance in the webui<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:38:12] &lt;rmatte&gt;

nope<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:38:58] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; darn<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:39:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; why?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:39:10] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; because mine looks like its working<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:39:19] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; but the service isnt being restart properly or somthing<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:39:22] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; so i wanted to check with someone<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:39:27] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; have a 2nd set of eyes look at it<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:39:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, test it manually<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:39:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it works manually then there's something wrong with your event manager filter for kicking off the script<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:40:14] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; nah, it says process restarted in the event manager<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:40:14] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: remember our conversation about interface monitoring after modeling?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:40:19] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; i'll figure it out<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:40:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: yes<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:40:48] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: i'm reading your posts in message/44368#44368<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:41:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; and you mentioned zenoss wont monitor interfaces it sees operationally down<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:41:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; that was the old behaviour in 2.4<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:41:16] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; (this was in 2.5)<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:41:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; oh<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:41:22] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; theres the confusion<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:41:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; It won't monitor interfaces it sees administratively down now<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:41:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; that was re-coded between those 2 versions<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:42:04] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ok that makes a bit more sense... and also explains why its monitoring a bunch of stuff thats adminup/operdown<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:42:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; monitoring stuff that's admin up honestly makes more sense<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:42:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; ports that aren't being used should be set to admin down<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:42:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's best practice for security reasons<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:42:46] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; although i'm seeing it mark stuff thats admindown/operdown as "unknown" and monitor=true<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:42:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it's just more organized<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:43:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, see, I don't know how the 3.0 interface itself handles it<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:43:49] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; magic<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:43:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; they could have messed it all up between 2.5 and 3.0<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:43:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:43:56] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'm trying to figure it out<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:45:25] &lt;imeyer&gt; rmatte: hm, the rsync idea is what i'm going with.. and actually works pretty well<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:45:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:46:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should only show unknown if monitor is set to false<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:46:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; not true<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:46:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh wtf, I'm trying to export my Mibs in to a ZenPack and it keeps bitching about concurrent access to objects<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:46:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; extremely frustrating since I stopped all of the daemons<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:48:26] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: it does change interfaces listed as up/down to unknown when i change monitor from true to false...<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:48:35] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; however, after modeling theres a lot of unknown/monitor=true<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:48:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; then that's a bug in the 3.0 interface<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:49:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; there are tons of them<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:49:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; guess i'll open a case and see if its known already... probably is<br/>[14-Oct-2010 13:49:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; wont be until next week that i can run the 2.5.2 thing past management<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:21:45] &lt;robo_&gt; hi: i'd like to know what date and time a server is unavailable. Is there some report or graph that can show this? I have a device that has 99.45% availability and i'd like to narrow this down to a date/time so I can investigate.<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:24:55] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i suspect some form of report<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:29:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; robo_ just search for all of the ip down events in the event console for that device<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:31:30] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; or that...<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:32:39] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: have you messed with event transforms in 3?&#160; i'm working on interface polling.. got the event class /status/ipinterface configured... but i cant get the eventclass mapping to work (no eventkey in event?)<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:33:12] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; just trying to make the error message from the threshold a little more human readable as per the posts about interface polling<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:33:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: Did you set the right event class for the thresholds?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:33:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; The threshold events should come in as /Status/IpInterface<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:34:04] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;&#160; /status/ipinterface<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:34:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you should apply the transform on the class itself<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:34:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; not in a mapping<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:34:09] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the events are in the right place<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:34:12] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm...<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:34:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the eventclasskey is irrelevent<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:34:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; you created an event mapping?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:34:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you did, that's wrong<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:35:15] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; this seems odd in 3<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:35:30] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so i created an event /status/ipinterface<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:35:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the threshold events get tossed into it correctly<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:35:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, first off it's case sensitive<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:35:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it had better be /Status/IpInterface<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:35:56] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah, i lost my shift key on irc<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:35:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; not ipinterface<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you need to navigate in to that class<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; they're getting categorized properly<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; then in the bottom left hand menu<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; at the very bottom right<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; select transform<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; put it in there<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; if evt.summary.startswith('threshold of operational status '):<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:42] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; if evt.severity &gt; 0:<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:42] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; evt.summary = "interface operationally down"<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:42] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; evt.message = "interface operationally down"<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:42] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; else:<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:43] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; evt.summary = "interface operationally up"<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:43] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; evt.message = "interface operationally up"<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:48] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; oh sweet, the sysadmin just blew my VM up<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:36:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:37:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm, seems something big failed here<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:38:42] &lt;newmon&gt; G'morning everyone<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:39:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; hey<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:39:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I said "at the very bottom right" I meant "at the very bottom left"<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:39:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you ever get your VM unexploded<br/>[14-Oct-2010 14:39:39] &lt;robo_&gt; rmatte, you said to search the event console -- that has nothing.

but the oid (1.3.6.1.4.1.232.6.2.9.3.1.7) doesn't walk.&#160; Note this is capacity used.&#160; Looks like the suse instance isn't responding.<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:23:50] &lt;wvcain&gt; snmpwalk bla bla system works.<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:24:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, all I know is that those HP management cards need some sort of SNMP forwarding configured on them<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:25:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; so that they forwards polls for the OS SNMP info but also for their own info<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:25:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I'm not even sure that can work with Linux<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:25:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I've never set one up first hand<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:25:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to look at the settings on the card<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:25:23] &lt;wvcain&gt;

i just need an example<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:26:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; ballison: an example of what, the output of the command?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:27:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; or on how to setup the datasource?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:27:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; the basics are that you create a command datasource in your template<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:27:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; then under the datasource you create 1 or more datapoints<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:27:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you configure the command that you want to run<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:28:45] &lt;wvcain&gt; Found a snmp rpm.&#160; I only installed the cmd line version of the tools.<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:28:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can pass things to the command such as "/path/to/script '${here/manageIp}' '${here/zWhatever}'<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:28:52] &lt;wvcain&gt; hp-snmp-agents-8.6.0.18-17.sles10.x86_64.rpm<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:29:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; then let's say you created 2 datapoints under the datasource called dataPoint1 and dataPoint2<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:29:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; your script would need to output like...<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:29:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; |dataPoint1=27 dataPoint2=879<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:29:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; and those values will be applied to their respecting datapoints<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:29:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; is that clear?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:32:47] &lt;ballison&gt; not really - but i have more details from the user now<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:32:52] &lt;ballison&gt; here's what he wants<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:33:06] &lt;ballison&gt; you get an alert into Zenoss and rather than page someone he wants to run a remote command FIRST<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:33:14] &lt;ballison&gt; if the command fixes the problem then clear the event<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:33:17] &lt;ballison&gt; else page someone.<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:33:30] &lt;ballison&gt; so the question is - how do we respond to an alart by running a remote.<br/>[14-Oct-2010 16:39:27] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

no, it's not on a per device basis<br/>[14-Oct-2010 17:49:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; when you enable monitoring of it in there it'll find it when you remodel any device<br/>[14-Oct-2010 17:49:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; like I said, the Zenoss Admin guide explains this<br/>[14-Oct-2010 17:49:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; have a read<br/>[14-Oct-2010 17:54:06] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: you aware of any way to manually alter network interface descriptions?<br/>[14-Oct-2010 17:54:18] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

whats it use?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:19:57] &lt;ericenns&gt; It gets the host and guest performance<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:20:17] &lt;ericenns&gt; fills the gap that there is right now<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:24:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: ESX and ESXi's SNMP support used to be ok, but they totally crippled it in their last release.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:25:49] &lt;ericenns&gt; ESX or ESXi users do you usually name your guest the same as its hostname?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:26:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; usually<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:26:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can name them however you want<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:26:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; it just makes sense to do it that way<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:26:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I don't use the fqdn<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:26:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; just the hostname<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:26:29] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh ok<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:26:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; sometimes they can be named differently though<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:26:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd probably have to account for both possible scenarios<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:27:12] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:27:27] &lt;ericenns&gt; it doesn't make a huge difference just means that there may not be links to the device in zenoss for the first release<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:28:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:28:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; you going to have the first release done in time for the contest?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:28:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; by the way, did you get my email with that render code you were missing for the test routine?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:28:57] &lt;ericenns&gt; I already have one version in the running I'm working on the update now<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:29:10] &lt;ericenns&gt; yes I got your email<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:29:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:29:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, without that code the test would work, but it would just output in html on a white screen<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:29:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; wasn't very pretty<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:29:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:29:33] &lt;ericenns&gt; trying to get the update in before the contest is done<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:29:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:29:42] &lt;ericenns&gt; haha ok cool<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:29:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hope you manage to<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:30:04] &lt;ericenns&gt; once this sysuptime is figured out which I may have, then I might be done<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:30:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:30:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd say submit it regardless of it's state<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:30:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; you've put a lot of time in to it<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:31:00] &lt;ericenns&gt; haha yeah, I got another zenpack that I have been workign on but it doesn't seem to work now lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:31:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus I'd be willing to bet that it'll work fine in both 2.5 and 3.0 after all those fixes that you made to the skins file and the datasource script<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:31:11] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh yeag<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:31:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; you did make the other changes I mentioned right?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:31:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; such as the bad case on that one variable<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:31:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; lower case l instead of uppercase L<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:31:51] &lt;ericenns&gt; I haven't yet that;s on my list after I get my VMwareESXiMonitor one done<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:32:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:32:08] &lt;ericenns&gt; this one relies on the dataSource pack<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:32:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:32:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; there was another fix that I mentioned but I forget what it was<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:32:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; you have all the stuff that I mentioned documented somewhere?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:32:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; (I can always go through and figure out what it was again if not<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:32:57] &lt;ericenns&gt; ya I got it all the emails<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:33:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; a couple of the changes I only mentioned on here though<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:33:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; like the L<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:33:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; and one other change<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:33:17] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh well then I lost those lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:33:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:33:33] &lt;ericenns&gt;

k so yeh, anywhere where it says errorlog instead of errorLog that needs to be changed<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:35:52] &lt;ericenns&gt; to lowercase l<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:35:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:36:02] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you need to change those to "errorLog" hehe<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:36:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you could have just done: sed -i "s/errorlog/errorLog/g" VMwareDataSource.py<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:36:52] &lt;rmatte&gt;

ya but I got a vim window open already so :%s/errorlog/errorLog/g is easier<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:37:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:37:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:37:27] &lt;cgibbons&gt;

k<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:39:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; there was something else weird about the skins file<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:39:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I included it in an email<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:39:40] &lt;ericenns&gt; something about header and footer in datasource<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:39:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, that was the latest problem<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:40:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; there were 3 problems with the datasource script and 2 with the skins file<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:40:11] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh ok<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:40:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll check my sent mail folder<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:40:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah yeh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:41:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you were missing a td<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:41:08] &lt;rmatte&gt;

ya i got that one<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:42:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:42:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; now, to see if I can figure out what that other change was<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:43:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; add the render code I sent in the spot that I specified<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:43:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; for starters<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:43:32] &lt;suprsonic&gt; my CPU threshold is triggering an email alert even with a escalate count of 10<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:44:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: the escalate count doesn't mean to only trigger an alert if the count equals 10<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:44:03] &lt;suprsonic&gt; when looking at graphs its clear the boxes are reaching 90% over a 50 minute time frame<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:44:29] &lt;suprsonic&gt; oh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:44:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can add an actual alert filter to filter based on count<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:44:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; which would accomplish what you want<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:01] &lt;suprsonic&gt; filter?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:05] &lt;suprsonic&gt; can you explain for me?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, ok, so go in to the alert properties<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:30] &lt;suprsonic&gt; email altering?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; at the bottom you'll see stuff like "if Production State equals Production<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; or whatever<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, nothing to do with the email<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:39] &lt;suprsonic&gt; ah right<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:40] &lt;suprsonic&gt; k<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; just add one of those filters for count<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and set it to 10<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:45:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; that way it'll only trigger alerts if the count equals 10<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:46:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; you might have to create a separate alerting rule just for CPU alerts<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:46:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; since you probably don't want some of the other alerts only triggering on 10<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:46:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you create 2 alerting rules and make 1 only match certain events based on the filters<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:46:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; understand?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:46:42] &lt;suprsonic&gt; got it thanks rmatte<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:46:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:47:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; ericenns: ok, so I'm working on finding that last problem...<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:47:56] &lt;ericenns&gt;

ericenns: you don't have an ESX box to test it against?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:52:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; or are you just worried it won't work in 2.5?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:52:38] &lt;ericenns&gt; 2.5 is my only concern<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:53:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:53:56] &lt;ericenns&gt; it should work after these changes I know my VMwareESXiMonitor is 2.5 compatible from I based it off of<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:53:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; well at least you'll be able to say the datasource pack is 2.5 compatible<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:53:59] &lt;rmatte&gt;

ya it uses ZennosVirtualHost which has a 2.5 version<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:57:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: I don't remember, I'd have to look and I don't have time, it's explained in the admin guide<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:57:34] &lt;suprsonic&gt; no worries<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:57:35] &lt;suprsonic&gt; thakns<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:57:48] &lt;ericenns&gt; escalation increases the severity when more events come in<br/>[15-Oct-2010 10:58:02] &lt;rmatte&gt;

ideas?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:06:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; my guess would be that if you snmpwalked the device you'd see a timeout<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:07:08] &lt;chachan&gt; mm<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:13:10] &lt;chachan&gt;

It finished<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:16:56] &lt;chachan&gt; it finished without getting time out<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:17:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; then I have no idea why it's timing out<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:17:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; and what is "faster enough"?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:17:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; can you literally read the snmpwalk line by line as it goes?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:21:47] &lt;chachan&gt; rmatte, well, I do just for "system", so, it's short, let me do it for all<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:22:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:22:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; I meant literally do a walk<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:22:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; not just system<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:22:19] &lt;chachan&gt; to see the behavior<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:22:24] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I get a timeout<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:26:55] &lt;chachan&gt; I guess I need to increase the timeout value in zProperties, right?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:27:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; no no<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:27:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; hold on<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:27:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're actually doing the snmpwalk from the commandline right?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:27:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; not from the zenoss ui?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:28:12] &lt;chachan&gt; mm, right, yes, I'm doing it from CLI<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:28:24] &lt;chachan&gt; let me do it from GUI<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:28:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; no no no<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:28:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wanted to make sure you were doing it from the CLI and not from the GUI<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:29:03] &lt;chachan&gt; ah ok<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:29:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so you run the walk from the CLI and it eventually times out?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:29:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; then net-snmp is screwed on the server<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:29:25] &lt;chachan&gt; yep<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:29:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; it has nothing to do with zenoss<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:29:36] &lt;chachan&gt; 0.o<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:30:06] &lt;chachan&gt; I started to having this issue in 5 servers<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:30:19] &lt;chachan&gt; you mean zenoss server?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:30:23] &lt;ashp&gt; they made me do a presentation on zenoss during our monthly meeting<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:30:27] &lt;ashp&gt; it went really, really, bad :/<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:31:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; is there some kind of firewall device between zenoss and those servers?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:31:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; that sucks but that had nothing to do with Zenoss<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:31:41] &lt;chachan&gt; rmatte, yes<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:31:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; any other monitoring tool would have died too<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:31:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm guessing the firewall device is interfering with the snmp traffic<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:32:27] &lt;chachan&gt; but I get snmp response and it stopped after 1m20seg.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:32:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; can you try snmpwalking one of the servers from the actual LAN segment that they are on?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:32:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:32:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; firewalls can let traffic flow for a bit then cut it off<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:32:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's entirely possible<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:32:48] &lt;chachan&gt; rmatte, ok, I'll do it<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:32:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:32:56] &lt;chachan&gt; rmatte, ok<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:33:51] &lt;cgibbons&gt; hmmm<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:33:59] &lt;cgibbons&gt;

glad i could help<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:34:50] &lt;ericenns&gt; haha yeah lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:35:21] &lt;ericenns&gt; but well your hear, do you know why I can snmp walk an oid but zenoss can't get the info for it<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:35:53] &lt;cgibbons&gt; is it the .0 at the end issue?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:36:37] &lt;ericenns&gt; I dont think so, when I walk It i get this for one of the 8 results SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.12740.2.1.7.1.3.1.1153338017.1 = Gauge32: 4860<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:37:18] &lt;ericenns&gt;

that sounds like it would<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:46:08] &lt;bhansen&gt; so in zenoss 3.0 what was the thought in not letting you select multiple alarms with shift and click?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:46:47] &lt;st3v3o&gt; I have that same question <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:47:15] &lt;ericenns&gt; it has to do with AJAX refreshing<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:48:26] &lt;ericenns&gt; what would happene is your would select a bunch then bam it refreshes and your selection is messed up<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:48:59] &lt;bhansen&gt; but would you not have the same issue with ctrl click<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:50:21] &lt;ericenns&gt; I don't know I asked this question months ago and can't exactly remember the answer<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:52:40] &lt;bhansen&gt; I have a large monitoring footprint and Im trying to evaluate if upgrading to 3.0.2 is worth it, myeventviews zenpack does not seem to work properly on 3.0<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:53:05] &lt;twm1010&gt;

the 3.0.2 vm is out<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:54:26] &lt;bhansen&gt; yeah, the things that I can see that would keep me are cosmetic at this point<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:54:40] &lt;bhansen&gt; other then the event views we uses them<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:54:59] &lt;bhansen&gt; and the python2.6 version does not seem to function<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:55:10] &lt;bhansen&gt; well it kinda works<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:56:33] &lt;fus10nx&gt; still couldnt get my damn aggregate reports to work<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:57:00] &lt;fus10nx&gt; is there a way to 100% remove ZenOSS and lose all my historical data and do a fresh install or should i fresh install everyting, linux included?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 13:59:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; fus10nx: how did you install Zenoss?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:09:12] &lt;Orv&gt; Can you upgrade a zenpack by just installing the newer version?&#160; Or do you have to remove/reinstall?&#160; (It's appears to be a minor upgrade)<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:09:45] &lt;mray&gt; Orv: just install the newer version<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:10:09] &lt;Orv&gt;

zenoss is picky about that<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:33:42] &lt;ericenns&gt; hrm doesn't make sense but I'll try<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:34:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, I'll make sense of it for you...<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:34:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; snmpwalk doesn't care whether something is an absolute OID or an index<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:34:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if you walk 1.3.6.1.4.1.12740.16.1.2.1.1 you'll get 1 value back<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:34:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it could theoretically display multiple values<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:34:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to specify that you're polling the first value<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:34:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; hence the .0<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:35:04] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you can save your performance data off<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:36:48] &lt;fus10nx&gt; eh it's not super important<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:36:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; ericenns: I'd be willing to bet it's actually 1.1.0<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:37:09] &lt;rmatte&gt;

like I set the datasource to 1.3.6.1.4.1.12740.16.1.2.1.1 and then zenoss adds on the .1.1<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:39:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I gotcha<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:39:54] &lt;ericenns&gt; ya I can show you what snmpwalk outputs for the table<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:39:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure how you're going to tackle that<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:40:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:40:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; do it with -On<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:41:19] &lt;ericenns&gt; http://pastebin.com/gP1TRgVS<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:41:31] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so all i have to do is ./zenoss-stack-3.0.2-linux-x64.bin right?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:41:34] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i did chmod +x on it already<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:41:53] &lt;fus10nx&gt; or &#226;&#8364;&tilde;sudo ./zenoss-stack-3.0.2-linux-x64.bin right&#226;&#8364;&trade;<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:42:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; run it as root<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:42:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:42:32] &lt;fus10nx&gt; installing<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:42:49] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so when i ran the uninstall it got rid of python, mysql, etc?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:43:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; ericenns: oh, I see how they've done the indexing<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:43:29] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh yeah?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:43:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to specify 1.3.6.1.4.1.12740.16.1.2.1 as the address for the snmp table<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:44:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you need to put .1.1 as the value for the table<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:44:17] &lt;ericenns&gt; i tried that but then zenoss adds on .1.1 and complains again<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:44:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:45:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh I see what you mean, the problem is with the template itself<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:45:10] * rmatte scratches his head<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:45:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to somehow get it to add the index and 1.1 together<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:45:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; instead of just the index<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:45:31] &lt;ericenns&gt; rmatte: another thing when I try to do a test in zenoss I get back no values is that normal<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:45:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it's not liking the OID, then yes<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:47:11] &lt;ericenns&gt; ya it doesn't seem to read the same table through zenos<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:48:00] &lt;ericenns&gt; btw the value is a Counter64<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:48:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; this is for an actual modeler plugin that you're coding, yes?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:48:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's fine, shouldn't matter<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:48:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; a value is a value<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:48:37] &lt;ericenns&gt; yes testing the oid lower down the tree it only reports on the INTEGER values<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:48:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:48:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd expect it to be able to handle the counter64 values<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:48:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; but maybe not<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:49:14] &lt;ericenns&gt; I guess it doesn't that's kinda dumb<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:49:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:49:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; you might have to end up writing a script to handle that data collection<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:49:40] &lt;ericenns&gt; the test uses snmp v1<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:49:45] &lt;ericenns&gt; when I snmp I use v2<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:50:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; the test just uses snmpwalk too<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:50:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; and zenoss doesn't<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:50:23] &lt;ericenns&gt; i think it may be a snmp version problem<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:50:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenoss uses twisted<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:50:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the test isn't very useful<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:50:47] &lt;ericenns&gt; yup changed the version and now it's showing values<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:50:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:51:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; either way, Zenoss uses twisted<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:51:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; not snmpwalk<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:51:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the test is irrelevant<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:51:30] &lt;ericenns&gt; guess I'll wait and see if the values start coming up now, yeah but it still has to use a certain snmp version or no?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:51:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:51:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to change the version to v2 in zProperties<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:51:52] &lt;ericenns&gt; that&#226;&#8364;&trade;s what I did<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:51:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I think it defaults to v2<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:51:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:52:19] &lt;ericenns&gt; it was at v1 for some reason<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:52:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:53:02] &lt;ericenns&gt; that makes sense to me though for stuff that was happening before on here<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:53:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hope you get your packs in in time lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:54:25] &lt;ericenns&gt; only got this one left so I will submit at end of day however it is lol most of it is working I have been just adding new features<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:54:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm testing my Cisco Mibs pack right now, but it takes like 5 hours to install<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:54:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I just have to wait<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:54:35] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh yeah fun stuff<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:55:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; It creates like 76000 Zope objects for the Mibs<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:55:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:55:19] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh wow lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:57:42] &lt;fus10nx&gt; OK hopefully this works<br/>[15-Oct-2010 14:58:44] &lt;cgibbons&gt; what's the worst that could happen...<br/>[15-Oct-2010 15:06:53] &lt;ericenns&gt;

maybe it takes a lot longer<br/>[15-Oct-2010 15:58:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; what are you trying to monitor CPU for?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 15:59:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; From what I recall that aggregate report expects very specific datapoint names...<br/>[15-Oct-2010 15:59:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to read up on datapoint aliases<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:00:44] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i didnt have to do any of that on 3.0.1<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:00:47] &lt;fus10nx&gt; it just -- worked<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:00:52] &lt;fus10nx&gt; then ceased working<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:01:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; no idea thenm<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:01:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; then*<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:01:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe try installing 3.0.1 and see if it works again?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:01:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; if so, then obviously something changed between 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 which broke it<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:01:26] &lt;fus10nx&gt; another issue is why my map isnt linking sites that can talk to each other it was so weird because before i had a link from NY to AZ and NOT FL and now i only have a link from NY to FL and no AZ - bizarre<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:01:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; it links based on each site having an IP address within the same subnet<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:01:50] &lt;fus10nx&gt; yea its only pulling the CPU information from the Linux server which stinks<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:01:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; if they don't then you'll get no link<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:01:57] &lt;fus10nx&gt; they all are<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:03:05] &lt;fus10nx&gt; such strange behavior with ZenOSS all the time for me<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:03:09] &lt;fus10nx&gt;

rmatte: leave some prizes for me lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:42:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:42:18] &lt;ericenns&gt; im still a university student lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:42:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh yeh, I forgot about that, you're just working with Zenoss as a project?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:43:19] &lt;ericenns&gt; yeh one of my many projects, at my job until christmas then back to the books<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:43:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:43:57] &lt;ericenns&gt; Yup, I'm thinking these ZenPacks should make my resume A little better<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:44:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll maintain your vmware packs if you're not able to<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:44:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; after you're done school<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:44:26] &lt;ericenns&gt; I got an ESXi server at home so I can still work on it for the time being<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:44:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:44:59] &lt;ericenns&gt; but thanks for the offer, my one zenpack I won't be able to maintain after the job, since I don't have no $100,000 SAN in my closet<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:45:05] * Sam-I-Am hasnt made a zenpack yet<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:45:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:45:20] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ericenns: what? everyone has one of those.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:45:31] &lt;ericenns&gt; haha really, dang I;m missing out<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:46:36] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: been slowly trying to hack together an improved routemap plugin<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:46:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:47:15] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; that variable is still not getting passed into it, but by hardcoding i can make it do stuff<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:47:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; also figured out part of the problem is it'll suck down the entire route table and then begin processing... so if you have a large routing table it'll choke anyway.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:47:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:48:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so i'm trying to modify it to only suck down specified networks<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:48:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:48:28] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; or an alternative is suck down a specified protocol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:49:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; not sure to what extent i want to fix this... it depends on what the boss thinks.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:49:32] &lt;ericenns&gt; I think I may be done this one zenpack now, dont feel like adding anything else at the moment<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:49:56] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ericenns: want to make one that does proper route slurping for dependencies?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:50:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; or something that'll provide a non-braindead way to do manual dependencies<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:50:45] &lt;ericenns&gt; haha not tonight, I am not really so sure what this all about at the moment<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:51:29] &lt;ericenns&gt; might be a good python exercise once I learn more of it<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:51:44] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; in short, zenoss will determine device dependencies by pulling routes out of your hosts and routers... supposedly automated. it might work in a small environment, but i run a transport network with 350k routes.&#160; it chokes and dies.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:52:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; thats a lot of routes :O<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:52:23] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh I see, I have a pretty small network I'm dealing with<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:52:25] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; usually either by killing the cpu in the router, or consuming all of the ram on the zenoss box<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:53:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; Sam-I-Am: is SNMP simply trying to grab too much simultaneously maybe?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:53:34] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; twm1010: well, the way the plugin is written (and it doesnt help the oids are a bit weird) ... it sucks the entire thing out in one shot.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:53:38] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; there is no filtering in the plugin<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:53:49] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; as of now it takes zenoss about 30 seconds to process 300 routes.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:53:58] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so 350k... might as well give up<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:54:20] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; in fact it never even gets that far... it blows chunks filling the array<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:54:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm... you happen to have support?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:54:52] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yes<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:55:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; what's they're take?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:55:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; *their<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:55:39] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; well, in general the opinion there... and in here... is it needs a rewrite.&#160; however, for *most* people's environments, it works fine.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:55:54] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:55:55] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; like, probably 99% of their customers<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:56:51] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the best way to do it using snmp would be to request only what's need to build the dependency tree... not the entire table at once and then process it.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:57:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, that is so weird<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:57:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; I changed the severity of 36 thresholds to Info<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:57:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; yet they are still coming in as Warning<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:57:34] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: rrrreeeboot!<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:57:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, I've already restarted zenoss<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:57:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; doesn't help<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:57:49] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; fr0mat heh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:58:07] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; this in 2.5 or 3?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 16:58:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2.5<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:02:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh I see why<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:02:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; remote collector? did you push?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:03:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; the severity is actually set on the event class itself<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:03:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; hadn't noticed that<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:03:18] &lt;twm1010&gt; doh!<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:03:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:03:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm headed out! have a good weekend everyone.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:03:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; you too<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:04:28] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; heh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:08:44] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: so in addition to adding the zproperty in zendmd, do i also need to add it to the device class?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:09:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, zProperties are global<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:09:08] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:09:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure it's actually set to the proper setting in Zenoss<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:09:37] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i see the zproperty... i can set it to true/false<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:09:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:09:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; that should be enough then<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:09:55] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; but it isnt making it into the plugin<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:10:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're trying to pull it in with getattr?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:10:18] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yes<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:10:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; ericenns said he was having the same problem with getattr in his vmware pack<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:10:35] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; igpOnly = getattr(device, 'zRouteMapCollectOnlyIGP', False)<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:10:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not sure what the solution is<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:10:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; it pulls in the other ones<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:10:48] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; but they were also defined before i touched all this<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:11:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, he's having a problem with a boolean too<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:11:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's something about the handling of the boolean zproperties<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:11:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh no wait, his was a username and pass<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:11:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; nevermind<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:11:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:11:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; but still same type of issue<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:11:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:11:45] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; dammit..<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:11:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you looked at other plugins for reference?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:12:16] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; this plugin already has 2 booleans that work fine<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:12:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:12:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; there must be a place where it's initially pulling the values down to them<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:12:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; something like _properties = whatever<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:12:48] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'm not enough of a python wizard... or zenoss debugger.. to figure out if the variable is even getting passed to the plugin<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:12:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then getattr pulls from there or something<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:13:06] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; there no errors or anything<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:13:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; pastebin the plugin code<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:13:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can't troubleshoot without seeing the code<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:13:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

and thats just the meat that matters...<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:16:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I see<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:16:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:16:54] &lt;cgibbons&gt; you restart zenhub after changing it?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:17:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i... dont think so<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:17:17] &lt;cgibbons&gt; whoops<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:17:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you need to restart to have Zenoss pick up on the new code<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:18:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; also... I'm not quite sure if this...<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:18:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; if indirectOnly and om.routetype != 'indirect':<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:18:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; should be changed to...<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:18:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; if indirectOnly == "True" and om.routetype != 'indirect':<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:18:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; It probably does work the first way<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:18:28] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; oh, i hadnt touched that part<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:18:40] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; my stuff was igp-related (the ospf crap)<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:18:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:18:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:19:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's fine then<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:19:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, if you hadn't restarted then that's your problem<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:19:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; basically this...<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:19:12] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; if igpOnly and om.routeproto != 'ospf' and om.routeproto != 'local':<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:19:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I saw<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:19:30] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; didnt know about the restart thing... just zenhub or the whole shebang?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:19:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do the whole shebang, but I think zenhub is all that's required<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:20:29] &lt;cgibbons&gt; for this just zenhub and the zenmodeler<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:22:20] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; might explain why my fix for the juniperdevice plugin took for manual remodeling, but periodic/automatic kept blowing up<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:22:38] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; something needed a restart<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:24:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:26:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ah, now its working<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:26:09] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; thx<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:26:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:27:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you get it working well it might be worth trying to get it implemented in a future version<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:27:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the route map fix?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:27:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:27:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I agree that it shouldn't be sucking every damn route down<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:27:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:27:50] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; at a minimum it should do selective sucking<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:27:58] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its just a matter of how to do selection<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:28:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:28:15] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i suppose i'll do it by network/mask and/or protocol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:28:30] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; and then derive the oids from those<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:28:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; pretty much backwards of how it works now<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:30:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:30:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; makes sense<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:30:18] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; now i just need to write it... and i guess learn me some more python<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:30:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:30:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; python isn't that bad<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:30:44] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; sure, its just not anywhere close to being in my job description.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:30:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; one of the easiest languages, but very powerful<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:30:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:31:08] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so its more a matter of convincing someone i need to do this and it'll benefit the org<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:31:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; using Zenoss and learning python pretty much go hand in hand<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:31:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; I didn't know any python before I started using Zenoss<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:31:27] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i think working dependencies would be awesome (assuming the rest of the dependency stuff works)<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:31:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:32:17] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; or just making a way to do manual dependencies<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:32:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; Interesting<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:33:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just got a potential job offer from google<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:33:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:33:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; out of the blue<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:33:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; heh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:33:28] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; once you get sucked in, you dont come back<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:33:36] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i've had 2 friends go to work there and i havent heard from them since<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:33:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:35:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; Network Transport Engineer<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:35:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; Install and maintain operational support systems for optical network elements.

&lt;ericenns&gt; sounds tempting<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:38:56] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; cant hurt<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:39:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; maybe you can at least figure out what they want<br/>[15-Oct-2010

I'll see what they say<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:45:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's nice getting an offer from an actual big company for a change, normally I just get calls from recruiters every other

17:52:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; they cant have everyone<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:52:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; otherwise we'd just have google and walmart... oh wait.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:52:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, Matt just mentioned that to me<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:52:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; The recruiter's linkedin page says "Currently looking for excellent coders with background in systems or networking."<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:52:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; they must have some monitoring project on the go<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:53:08] &lt;cgibbons&gt; california is always the showstopper for

though, so if it required relocation that's a no go<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:53:43] &lt;ericenns&gt; any ideas as what to do to figure out why a snmp modeler plugin isn't getting picked up I have looked at the zenhub and zenmodeler logs to no avail<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:54:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ericenns: its not showing up in the plugins list?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:54:11] &lt;ericenns&gt; it shows up in the

correct?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:55:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; even the smallest error and you won't see it<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:55:30] &lt;ericenns&gt; it is the only one in my modeler plugin list I will check again<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:55:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:56:06] * Sam-I-Am wanders off... home time!<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:56:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; later<br/>[15-Oct-2010 17:59:18]

up<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:11:06] &lt;ericenns&gt; I was going to add some temp stuff but It was going to take a long time so it's left for later<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:11:17] &lt;rmatte&gt;

woohoo<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:24:04] &lt;cgibbons&gt; hurm i could use a bike ride today<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:24:07] &lt;cgibbons&gt; cool, eric<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:24:58] &lt;ericenns&gt; yup I bike to work everyday in a city where motorists extremely distest cyclests<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:25:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; if I biked to work I wouldn't make it until the end of the day<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:25:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:25:48] &lt;ericenns&gt; haha no lol why not<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:26:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I live crazy far from work<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:26:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's almost an hour by car, 2 hours by bus<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:26:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; biking would be ridiculous<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:26:38] &lt;ericenns&gt; mine is 45 min by bus, 30 by bike, and 20 by car<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:26:41] &lt;cgibbons&gt; when i had a place in austin last year i would bike commute to zenoss a lot. i miss doing that.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:27:09] &lt;cgibbons&gt; so instead now i just go for long rides during lunch <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:27:36] &lt;ericenns&gt; cool, I enjoy biking a lot<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:27:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the other thing is it's almost an hour by highway, and you can't go on the highway with a bike<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:28:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I'd have to take the route that would be like an hour and a half by car<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:28:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:28:20] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh I see lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:28:57] &lt;cgibbons&gt; that sounds perfect<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:29:04] &lt;cgibbons&gt; you'd never be stressed out @ work or after with that<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:29:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; bleh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:29:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd never get any work either because I'd be sleeping under my desk<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:29:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; work done*<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:29:25] &lt;chachan&gt; ericenns, where are you from?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:29:42] &lt;ericenns&gt; I'm from Winnipeg<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:29:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; winter is also coming up, biking in -30 degree weather is impossible<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:30:26] &lt;ericenns&gt; I know I may have until end of November if I'm lucky these 3 celsius rides in the morning are starting to get cold lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:30:28] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; oh, its fun!<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:30:31] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yeah that would suck<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:30:33] * Sam-I-Am has studded tires on his bike<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:30:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; but riding when it's 110f heat index out sucks really bad, too<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:31:06] &lt;ericenns&gt; non studded riding in winter is fun when the wind comes and knocks you over<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:31:07] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i spent last week at high altitude so coming back home was like getting a shot of EPO or something. too bad that won't last.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:31:28] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; cgibbons: yeah, this summer was super hot<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:31:36] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; &lt;- racer<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:31:55] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; some of those hot races just killed me... i'd overheat, puke, and be done.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:32:06] &lt;ericenns&gt; Sam-I-Am: road or mountain<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:32:09] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; road<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:32:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I can't handle extreme heat overly well<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:32:33] &lt;cgibbons&gt; there's a point where the heat/humidty just kills me, even though i live in it all t he time. can't cool down, so the brain will shut me down. it sucks. feels like a bonk when it happens. once the first cool front @ the end of september came in it was such a treat.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:32:36] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; anything much above 85 with humidity is rediculous<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:32:40] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yep<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:32:45] &lt;cgibbons&gt; that's the point<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:32:48] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh my favorite ride this year was when a wasp went down my collar and bike me three times while in rush hour traffic<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:32:57] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; my trainer seems to think he can improve my hot weather riding capabilities... but we'll see.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:33:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; wasps suck<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:33:03] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ericenns: ugh..<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:33:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I got nailed last time I was playing paintball<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:33:33] &lt;chachan&gt; I can't ride bike in my city, it's dangerous<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:33:36] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i had a couple of long runs a few weeks ago... one week it was 78F with 75F dew point.. 9 agonizing miles. next week it was 75F with a 55F dew point, did 10 miles 11 minutes faster total than the 9 miles the week before. crazyness.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:33:37] &lt;ericenns&gt; yeah I went to the closest bike shop and bought a cycling jersey right away so that it wouldn't happen again<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:33:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was in a truck with my buddy, and a wasp started stinging his leg<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:33:39] &lt;chachan&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:33:40] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i love this time of year... been great riding since early september<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:33:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; we almost went off the road<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:33:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:34:10] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; too bad race season is mostly over by then<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:34:28] &lt;ericenns&gt; chachan: ya that sucks I've been lucky it seems I hear a lot of people in my city get door prizes<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:34:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i had a wasp/bee land on my leg when i was descending off wolf creek pass on colorado this june... didn't think and swatted at it, bad idea at 45 mph. bike got squirrely. could have ended very very badly.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:34:57] &lt;chachan&gt; cya guys<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:35:04] &lt;cgibbons&gt; the locals reminded me to 'take the sting' <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:35:08] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; cgibbons: the thing i notice most is heart rate.&#160; i can hammer at 180 forever, but much above that i cant maintain even if i'm not going any faster/harder. in hot weather, i quickly see 195 at the same effort level and poof, i'm blown<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:35:35] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yeah that whole effort per heart rate is a great indicator in the heat<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:35:36] &lt;cgibbons&gt; do you train with power?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:35:47] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; nope, just HR for now<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:36:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i think my trainer is hooking me up with power this winter<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:36:33] &lt;cgibbons&gt; there's a cool metric some of the software does... the Pw:HR ratio. imagine two linear trend-lines for your heat-rate and power.. if the percentage difference is close (under 5%) then it means you're pretty fit, otherwise you need more base fitness.... in theory... if you don't live somewhere hot.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:36:45] &lt;cgibbons&gt; all summer my Pw:HR would be like 15-20%... as soon as that cool front came through, 2.5%<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:36:49] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah, i think thats kinda what he's looking at<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:37:08] &lt;cgibbons&gt; training with power is awesome, really helps<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:37:34] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i remember a time trial from june... hit 195 quickly, puked, and averaged 21 mph.&#160; just did the same time trial last weekend in 55F... i kept a solid 180 and did 24 mph avg.&#160; also didnt puke.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:37:53] &lt;cgibbons&gt; ugh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:37:54] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; and i'm way less fit now than i was during peak of race season<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:38:00] &lt;cgibbons&gt; those #s.... you must be young <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:38:12] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ha, soon hitting the big three zero<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:38:20] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; it kinda sucked this year putting my race age as "30"<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:38:24] &lt;cgibbons&gt; heh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:38:44] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'm a weird beast though... i can kill people on hills, but flats i kinda suck.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:38:51] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; might be 4 years of living in colorado<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:38:56] &lt;cgibbons&gt; highest ive ever seen mine was at 184... that was also in my first crit in '08... i made the mistake of looking, i saw that #, and immediately got dropped since i mentally freaked out at the #. lesson learned.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:38:57] &lt;ericenns&gt; any sugesstions what I should but for company in the contribution forms, can't put mine for legal reasons<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:39:47] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ha, there is the heart rate freaking problem... coach tells me i might just avoid wearing one for things other than time trials<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:39:55] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ericenns: "god, inc."<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:40:20] &lt;ericenns&gt; haha nice<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:40:37] &lt;ericenns&gt; I'll just go with my online alias<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:40:54] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; why would your company not want the info published?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:42:06] &lt;ericenns&gt; because they don't believe in open source, but my boss and supervisor do<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:42:16] &lt;cgibbons&gt; you wouldn't like rides like this one then (one of my normal longer routes): http://connect.garmin.com/activity/43700388 - ~110 ft real elevation gain over 72 miles. no hills, but lots of wind!<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:44:03] &lt;cgibbons&gt; do you not have any IP agreements you have to worry about, eric, or is this all after-hours stuff anyway?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:44:15] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; heh, houston<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:44:18] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; super humid!<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:45:01] &lt;ericenns&gt; I have no IP agreements to worry about<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:45:07] &lt;cgibbons&gt; excellent<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:45:15] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i spent the first 4 years of my life in missouri city<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:45:16] &lt;mray&gt; yeah, as long as it's in good faith<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:45:18] &lt;cgibbons&gt; why not just n/a then?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:45:35] &lt;cgibbons&gt; right next door to me then<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:45:39] &lt;ericenns&gt; I could've done that, but oh well a little to late<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:45:39] &lt;cgibbons&gt; litterally across the street<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:45:44] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; 2239 stillmeadow drive<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:45:50] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; probably still there<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:45:52] &lt;mray&gt; cgibbons: I'd think about switching to a Garmin setup, but I like my Nike+ stats<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:46:20] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i really like mine, matt. i've got the 310xt and then i just got the edge 500 recently for just the bike. i'll use the 310xt for the multi-sport days.<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:46:26] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; wait, i just realized something... a group of nerds who get exercise?<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:46:37] &lt;mray&gt; heh<br/>[15-Oct-2010 18:46:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i think briane is getting a 300 after seeing the garmin connect

useradd zenoss and pwd zenoss?<br/>[18-Oct-2010 12:40:57] &lt;Simon4&gt; that should work, I do it in puppet as part of our automation<br/>[18-Oct-2010 12:41:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, he's going to have to specify the home dir, the shell, etc...<br/>[18-Oct-2010 12:41:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh<br/>[18-Oct-2010 12:41:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's also the environment variables... not sure if the

12:58:17] &lt;ericenns&gt; I installed the zenpack yay and did a restart, then I just installed zenoss on another device and setup public key authentication to it<br/>[18-Oct-2010 12:58:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; read down in the comments on the zenpack page, I made some posts explaining that in greater detail.&#160; I'll have to write it up more formally and get it added to the page

didn't see yours<br/>[18-Oct-2010 12:59:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeah, they are there <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:00:10] &lt;rmatte&gt;

tho)<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:17:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do a lot of work with the terminal, so Linux is better for me<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:17:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; even though I'm aware that Mac has a terminal<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:17:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just not the same though<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:18:00] straterr1 is now known as straterra<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:18:01] &lt;imeyer&gt; close enough<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:18:09] &lt;imeyer&gt; i mean, you don't get 256 colors with terminal.app<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:18:13] &lt;imeyer&gt; but, whatever<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:18:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's more having access to aptitude or yum<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:18:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; that I would miss<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:19:00] &lt;imeyer&gt; mac has this awesome thing called homebrew that rules

&lt;imeyer&gt; http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula/<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:19:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt they'd be comparable to ubuntu repos<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:20:04] &lt;imeyer&gt; well, it's not really repo oriented<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:20:20] &lt;imeyer&gt; it's more.. here's the formula to install this software.. and it does it pretty cleanly<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:20:34] &lt;imeyer&gt; it's definitely not the same as yum install or apt-get install<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:21:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll just stick to Linux <img height="16px"

lost<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:24:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; ericenns: what in particular is tripping you up?<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:24:51] &lt;ericenns&gt; zenoss isn't running on the remote server, I follow the

expect<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:26:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're not going to have access to a web UI on the remote collector, if that's what you're saying<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:26:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; only certain daemons will be running<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:26:34] &lt;ericenns&gt; ok well I don't see anything running when I do a zenoss status<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:26:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; I though the pack was supposed to configure and launch the processes<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:27:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're sure your environment variables are configured as I described in my posts?<br/>[18-Oct-2010

13:27:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; you also need to add the environment file like I described<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:27:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; read what I said really carefully<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:28:32] &lt;ericenns&gt; ok but I get no error when I do update remote collector<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:28:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk for a few, I need to grab some lunch<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:28:43] &lt;ericenns&gt;

13:32:40] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yay for spontaneous meetings<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:32:50] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; now i just get to make it all work<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:35:27] &lt;bigegor&gt; ericenns: run 'zenoss

3.0 is getting better, but working with templates in it is a nightmare<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:51:46] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; figured out the rrd intervals and history levels for the various groups of devices too... yay progress.<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:51:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:52:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; only 3 consolidations so the sysadmin is happy about i/o<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:52:59] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i think our plan is to roll 2.5.2 now and then begin testing 3.x officially when it gains significant features... perhaps 3.1 or whatever.<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:54:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:54:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; there will still be an upgrade path to follow, but oh well<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:54:47] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yep<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:55:12] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; we're more concerned about rrd history than alerts and stuff, so even if upgrading breaks.<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:55:22] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

as long as the ip stuff routes properly<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:58:46] &lt;ericenns&gt; I mean maybe some will end up with the same ips<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:59:13] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; how?<br/>[18-Oct-2010 13:59:34] &lt;ericenns&gt;

I was wondering why there are two bridge interfaces in the new version, that might be a limitation of zenoss?<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:23:13] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: where are these zenpatches located?<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:23:14] &lt;mducharme-laptop&gt; as in perhaps you can't customize column headings under components -&gt; (name of custom component) ??<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:23:38] &lt;ericenns&gt; mducharme: No you can customize column headings under components<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:24:18] &lt;mducharme-laptop&gt; ok so then<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:24:27] &lt;mducharme-laptop&gt; there is no real need to have things set up the way jane curry does in that zenpack<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:24:31] &lt;ericenns&gt; I'll show you a screenshot in a second<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:24:38] &lt;mducharme-laptop&gt;

Sam-I-Am: you just need to use zenpatch to install them<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:25:28] &lt;ericenns&gt; mducharme-laptop: yes correct<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:25:38] &lt;mducharme-laptop&gt; ok cool<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:25:42] &lt;rmatte&gt;

hell, if hipsters are trendy, nerds are trendy... they dress worse than us<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:31:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; nerd doesn't define someone who is computer savvy though<br/>[19-Oct-2010 12:32:10] &lt;rmatte&gt;

and used memory (i.e. filesystem cache)<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:02:09] &lt;jmp242&gt; and actual programs<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:02:15] &lt;ericenns&gt; merlincorey: are you making your own datasource or just a template?<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:02:24] mrayzenoss is now known as mray<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:02:40] &lt;bigegor&gt;

I am making a template for a server type that I have my own COMMAND data source for... but it has like 17 metrics and they are repeated 3 times for a total of 51... don't want to do that by hand ever again (and I will be adding more metrics to this set in the future)<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:07:43] &lt;Simon4&gt; merlincorey: you can create templates and datasources within a template with zendmd<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:08:10] &lt;merlincorey&gt; Simon4: you mean the web interface?<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:08:21] &lt;ericenns&gt; merlincorey: ok that's what I was looking for I will give you a look at my source<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:08:24] &lt;Simon4&gt; merlincorey: no, the scripting interface<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:08:48] &lt;merlincorey&gt; Simon4: I see the docs now thanks<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:08:59] &lt;merlincorey&gt; ericenns: thanks<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:09:14] &lt;Simon4&gt; merlincorey: let me know if you want me to pastie a sample or two, i have some sample code somewhere<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:09:15] &lt;merlincorey&gt; so do I basically then make a .egg or zenpack or whatever that has a script that uses the zendmd?<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:09:34] &lt;merlincorey&gt; that would certainly save me some time, but I am gonna read through the docs eventually <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:09:34] &lt;Simon4&gt; you can just make a python script that uses zendmd as the zenoss user<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:10:06] &lt;merlincorey&gt; so I'd be making like an "install-template.py" basically and run it as zen user with zen's python?<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:10:11] &lt;ericenns&gt; merlincorey: nevermind my way<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:10:17] &lt;Simon4&gt; merlincorey: indeed<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:10:24] &lt;merlincorey&gt; excellent that's pretty much what I was looking for<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:10:32] &lt;ericenns&gt; I thought you had a custom data source<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:10:36] &lt;merlincorey&gt; it is custom data source<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:10:40] &lt;merlincorey&gt; a custom command<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:10:45] &lt;merlincorey&gt; that outputs 51 data points :S<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:10:53] &lt;merlincorey&gt; adding them into the interface by hand was a really long process yesterday<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:11:14] &lt;ericenns&gt; merlincorey: No I mean a custom datasource type<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:11:26] &lt;merlincorey&gt; oh you mean like separate from say SNMP or COMMAND?<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:11:34] &lt;ericenns&gt; yes exactly<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:11:51] &lt;Simon4&gt; merlincorey: if you've already done it, the other thing you can do is make a zenpack in the GUI, then add that template to the zenpack<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:11:58] &lt;Simon4&gt; then you can export the zenpack and use it elsewhere<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:12:03] &lt;merlincorey&gt; well I need to modify it<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:12:11] &lt;merlincorey&gt; I am adding more metrics / removing some I don't find useful<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:12:16] &lt;Simon4&gt; right, if you want to modify things than scritping it is definitely the way to go<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:12:41] &lt;merlincorey&gt; but I wonder if there is a better way to go about what I am doing<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:13:06] &lt;ericenns&gt; you can always re-add it to the zenpack but that involves updating it everychnage<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:13:13] &lt;merlincorey&gt; essentially, I have a service that runs 3 different instances on a single server on 3 different servers, so I am graphing data from each of the services on each of the servers<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:13:38] &lt;merlincorey&gt; so my hacky way at the moment was to write a command that received the three ports to check status on and then outputs data points for each one<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:13:49] &lt;merlincorey&gt; but obviously, if I have 2 instances or 4 instaces in the future, I'll have to rewrite this<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:13:59] &lt;merlincorey&gt; or at least redo the zen template<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:14:09] &lt;merlincorey&gt; anyway thanks for zendmd makes this sustainable for now<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:14:19] &lt;Simon4&gt; merlincorey: I scripted up the creation of custom apache templates for exactly that reason<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:14:33] &lt;Simon4&gt; it let me create copies of the template with different ports and names for datapoints etc very easily<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:15:00] &lt;merlincorey&gt; excellent, sounds like I went a decent way then<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:15:01] &lt;Simon4&gt; so in my opinion at least, you're on the right track<br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:15:30] &lt;merlincorey&gt; I just was really sure there was a better way than spending and hour in the web interface if I need to do this again <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[19-Oct-2010 15:15:33] &lt;merlincorey&gt;

I'm beginning to wonder if I should poke around in Zope a bit to see if the Zenpacks giving me issues are even in there<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:30:59] &lt;jmp242&gt; I wonder if I try deleting the zenpack from Zope and then the filesystem if that would make anything worse (in other parts of the app)<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:31:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; man I love this formula zenpack<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:31:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm finally able to create memory thresholds properly for a bunch of my templates<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:32:01] &lt;ericenns&gt;

he loves it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:58:55] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; they treat them very well<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:58:55] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; this is ex-foundry stuff<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:58:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; you have to use a for loop, you can't just use the function by itself<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:59:09] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its cool equipment... lacks a little in a few areas.<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:59:15] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; oh okay thanks<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:59:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:59:22] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; may i ask why?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:59:27] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; i like to understand stuff not just remember it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:59:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok... well...<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:59:45] * xuru sits down to listen<br/>[20-Oct-2010 11:59:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're calling setManageIp() as a function on d<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:00:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; but d needs to be set to something<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:00:09] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; gotcha<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:00:18] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; so i could change that to a if i wnated correct?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:00:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; what the for loop is doing is executing getSubDevices, and for each object in the execution it sets d to the path to that particular device<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:00:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then it executes setManageIP() for it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:00:45] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; ah makes sense<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:01:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; and no, you can't use an if, it has to be a for loop<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:01:17] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; no no<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:01:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; for example, if getSubDevices() returned...<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:01:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; device1<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:01:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; device2<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:01:23] &lt;Parabola|W&gt;

then the result would be device1.setManageIp() and device2.setManageIp()<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:01:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:02:01] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:02:03] &lt;rmatte&gt;

yeah<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:03:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; now, if you're wanting to execute that as a standalone script you'll need: docs/DOC-3217<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:08:16] nonsenso_ is now known as nonsenso<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:22:54] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

i have some other classifications i need to figure out like critical and non-critical.<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:24:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; but should those be groups or systems...<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:24:37] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: it sure seems that way<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:24:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can set device severity<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:24:51] &lt;ericenns&gt; ok I got a website up very basic http://futamill.ca/<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:24:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just set critical devices to high severity<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:24:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; high priority, rather<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:25:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; and set everything else to normal<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:25:05] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

rmatte: I know I can do that<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:28:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; no point in building a whole new egg for 2.5.2<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:29:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; just use the existing egg<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:29:11] &lt;ericenns&gt;

yeh<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:30:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; just run zenpatch again<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:31:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; and when it asks to assume -r answer yes<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:32:54] &lt;ericenns&gt; rmatte: ok I changed it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:33:41] &lt;kobalt&gt;

ericenns: cool.&#160; once the vmware shiz is up i'll give them a whirl<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:35:17] &lt;ericenns&gt; xuru: It works with ESX and ESXi, or it should they use the same things<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:35:22] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeh<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:35:28] &lt;ericenns&gt; only tested on ESXi<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:35:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; also, apparently vmware is planning to drop esx in the future<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:35:41] &lt;xuru&gt; I'll give it a whurl<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:35:44] &lt;ericenns&gt; and esxi?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:35:45] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; leaving only esxi (which they should have just called sexi)<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:35:56] &lt;ericenns&gt;

that's their money maker lol<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:41:29] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; well, replacing it with esxi<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:41:39] &lt;ericenns&gt; ESXi plus addons is also a money amker<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:41:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; which still requires $$$$ for any useful features<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:41:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; which they will then charge money for?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:41:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:41:58] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; esxi is only free if you want to do one thing... basic VMs with no redundancy<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:42:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:42:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; we use ESXi in our lab (the free version)<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:42:36] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; vmotion is the killer<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:42:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; but we have ESX in production<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:42:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; followed by storagemotion<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:42:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, we have vmotion<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:42:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; works nicely<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:42:58] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; even for a non-profit like myself its stupid expensive<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:43:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i wonder how well redhat's vm solution works. vmware needs a little competition.<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:43:29] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:43:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, there's always XEN<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:43:58] &lt;xuru&gt; I agree with Sam-I-Am<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:44:16] &lt;xuru&gt; I don't trust Citrix<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:44:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; Xen Hypervisor<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:45:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; not Citrix<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:45:31] &lt;xuru&gt; yeah, I thought citrix bought them<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:45:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, Citrix has some "XenServer" product that is based on it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:45:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's not the same thing<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:46:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus the majority of the Xen code was done prior to Citrix buying them<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:46:25] &lt;xuru&gt; true<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:46:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't trust Citrix as a product<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:46:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; since the biggest IT disaster I've ever experienced was with Citrix<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:47:04] &lt;xuru&gt; yes<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:47:18] &lt;xuru&gt; and that product is such a resource hog<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:47:34] &lt;rmatte&gt;

but yeh, if you download xen from xen.org it's the opensource version of the project<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:48:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it has a lot of bells and whistles<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:48:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; It can do vmotion style redundency<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:48:14] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; xen is a very cool product<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:48:25] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; good amount of reading involved<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:48:28] &lt;xuru&gt; ok, I thought it was like what happened with MySql<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:48:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:48:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; xuru: nah<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:48:47] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; i'm using vmware esxi 4 right now, but when we move colos<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:48:51] &lt;forsberg&gt;

well, it supports virtual console, live snapshots, vmotion style movement of servers<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:49:31] &lt;forsberg&gt; i just need to be able to make a machine fast, without reading man and all that sheit ;&gt;<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:49:39] &lt;forsberg&gt;

you can make the best product in the world, but if it isn't easy to use, no one will use it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:51:15] &lt;forsberg&gt; on that note, anything "new" in the esxi snmp zenoss department that is not represented on the zenoss.org website ? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[20-Oct-2010 12:51:41] &lt;forsberg&gt;

2.5 was great<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:06:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, 2.5 works very well<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:06:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can't deal with any instability or usability issues right now<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:06:37] &lt;Parabola|W&gt;

2.5.0 and 2.5.1 were garbage up until 2.5.2<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:08:16] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; sweet<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:08:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2.5.2 needs a few patches but not as many<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:08:20] &lt;Parabola|W&gt;

Sam-I-Am: yeh, but if he removes them, they re-generate, and he gets data, then it means that the RRD files got screwed somehow<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:19:19] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; no changes to zenoss or os updates/changes and it broke<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:19:20] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; if you still have the old ones, you could use rrdtool to look at when things started<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:19:30] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; nah i rmed them<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:24:01] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; cool, the CIO wants to meet me at the place i interviewed at yesterday<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:24:18] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

Orv, newsflash: zenoss is full retard<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:24:48] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; think of it like the road runner<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:24:54] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; he can walk on air because he doesnt know about gravity<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:25:03] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; zenoss doesnt know any better, so ping works, hehe<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:25:05] &lt;Orv&gt; Even set a maintenance period for that box - still pings it..<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:25:05] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; Orv: it will still monitor in maint mode<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:25:10] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

it changes sate from production to maint and back again<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:25:54] &lt;Orv&gt; Yep, it's still alerting..<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:26:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; on a particular device or things nested below the device?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:26:54] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i know whomever configured groups/devices/systems here the first time does not work well for maintenance windows.<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:27:00] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; rmatte,&#160; so i restarted zenoss and my processes dropped from 110 to 100 somthing<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:27:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; since the dependencies are all screwed up<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:27:02] &lt;Parabola|W&gt;&#160; erm 1100*<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:27:20] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; what were the leftover processed named?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:27:27] &lt;Parabola|W&gt;

sounds like fping has some sort of issue<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:28:04] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; 1103 to be exact, 1100 were sleeping<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:28:08] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; cpu load was still 0.05<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:28:22] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; my next task is to create an alert based on the results of fping<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:28:25] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah, but zenoss could be waiting for them to terminate... or enough of them arent returning data<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:29:28] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so why fping over the default method of checking connectivity?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:29:38] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; for the graphs<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:31:33] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; looking at RTT?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:31:59] &lt;Parabola|W&gt;

why would it not terminate itself<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:34:57] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i dont think its a zenoss thing<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:35:36] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; fping works as a command, right?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:37:07] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; i restarted zenoss, and the processes went away<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:37:19] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; i wipe out my rrd graphs and the new ones work<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:37:24] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; sure... its spawning the processes<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:37:27] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; right<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:37:35] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so when the parent terminates, so do the children (if they behave)<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:37:37] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; it cant be zenoss its an external process<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:38:13] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; your graphs are getting screwed up because zenoss isn't receiving data back from fping either a) in time or b) ever or c) in a format it understands<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:38:43] &lt;ashp&gt; damn, how do i raise the priority of the high disk space usage monitoring<br/>[20-Oct-2010 14:38:49] &lt;ashp&gt;

a reporting engine on top of that, and we've done some internal prototyping of some statistical analysis using R<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:00:59] &lt;Simon4&gt; tiredofme: once I get around to it I'll certainly publish em<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:01:14] &lt;cgibbons&gt;

understandable<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:03:07] &lt;ericenns&gt; mray: thanks looks alot nicer<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:03:37] &lt;tiredofme&gt; we've been brainstorming some ways of accomplishing this, basically we narrowed it down to one of two possibilities:<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:03:52] &lt;tiredofme&gt; use rrdextract to dump the data to xml, xml to mysql<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:04:06] &lt;cgibbons&gt; sure<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:04:13] &lt;ericenns&gt; mray: is there a way to download it from there<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:04:21] &lt;cgibbons&gt; actually dump it out to csv from rrdexport<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:04:29] &lt;cgibbons&gt; if you want to get a fast load<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:04:39] &lt;tiredofme&gt; or insert a layer between the performance collectors that will essentially write the raw data to mysql<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:04:51] &lt;tiredofme&gt; however I'm not sure if thats entirely feasibly<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:04:55] &lt;tiredofme&gt; feasible*<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:05:06] &lt;mray&gt; ericenns: svn co http://dev.zenoss.org/svn/branches/zenoss-3.0.x/zenpacks/ZenPacks.zenoss.ZenossVirtualHostMonitor/ZenPacks/zenoss/ZenossVirtualHostMonitor<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:05:34] &lt;cgibbons&gt; someone here did a prototype of doing effectively that, except it was just forwarding off the datapoint sample onto a UDP connection that got consumed by something else. handy if you want the data as its polled, and don't care if you miss some.<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:06:03] &lt;cgibbons&gt; longer term we'll be using AMQP stuff to accomplish that and get it into the database @ sample time<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:06:15] &lt;cgibbons&gt; we're using AMQP for some new event work in Avalon<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:06:49] &lt;mray&gt; tiredofme: I know I saw a patchset for RRDTool somewhere that allowed you to have it write to files and dbs<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:06:57] &lt;tiredofme&gt; thanks for the ideas, I feel a little better knowing that this is at least possible now, up until this point it was just all speculation for us<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:07:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; anything is possible, its just a matter of coding it.<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:07:12] &lt;tiredofme&gt; mray: cool, I'll have to look for that<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:07:16] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; and if it works WELL<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:07:23] &lt;ericenns&gt; mray: could not read status line error I'm not allowed to do it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:07:49] &lt;cgibbons&gt; I would suggest getting very comfortable with the idea of doing it on a periodic polling interval.. you probably don't really need the data fast (really!) and the faster you get it the more architecture you need and the more resiliency you'll need.<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:08:13] &lt;mray&gt; ericenns: what's that?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:08:19] &lt;cgibbons&gt; Also consider using the ARCHIVE storage engine in MySQL; I haven't tried it yet, but effectively performance data is write-once data.<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:08:44] &lt;ericenns&gt; mray Could not read status line: Connection reset by peer (http://dev.zenoss.org)<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:08:49] &lt;tiredofme&gt; thats exactly what I was thinking, however, my co-worker really wants the data available on demand<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:08:57] &lt;ericenns&gt; mray: while trying to a svn co<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:09:01] &lt;mray&gt; ericenns: that's odd, I just did it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:09:16] &lt;tiredofme&gt; but I agree that a slower polling interval is the best way to do it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:09:16] &lt;mray&gt; svn co http://dev.zenoss.org/svn/branches/zenoss-3.0.x/zenpacks<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:09:49] &lt;ericenns&gt; mray: yeah same error<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:10:14] &lt;cgibbons&gt;&#160;&#160; Make them 'the graph'<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:10:23] &lt;cgibbons&gt; the one that shows you sample time to cost<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:10:33] &lt;cgibbons&gt; notice that it's exponential, not logarthmic<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:10:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; then tell them to STFU<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:10:40] &lt;cgibbons&gt; or pony up<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:10:54] &lt;tiredofme&gt; haha, thats a good way of putting it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:11:12] &lt;tiredofme&gt; well let me finalize my zenoss setup first, then we'll move onto modding the hell out of it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:11:55] &lt;cgibbons&gt; I did some math recently on this, too<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:12:01] &lt;cgibbons&gt; on the storage requirements<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:12:06] &lt;cgibbons&gt; it's a lot, but not outrageous<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:12:23] &lt;mray&gt; ericenns: svn co http://dev.zenoss.com/svn/branches/zenoss-3.0.x/zenpacks ?&#160; switch to zenoss.com?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:12:23] &lt;cgibbons&gt; Say 11 TB a year for all the raw data for 25000 devices of about 100 data points average per device<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:12:35] &lt;tiredofme&gt; hmmm<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:12:44] &lt;cgibbons&gt; and the reality is you won't have many, even by a long shot, nor would you want every data point<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:13:12] &lt;cgibbons&gt; so figure you'd want 3 years tops in a database for analysis before it gets too old... ok, that's still within the realm of possibility of management for a single DB server<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:13:28] &lt;ericenns&gt; mray: same could not read status line error<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:13:37] &lt;tiredofme&gt; well i'm worried about project bloat, as this will be used for supplying data to a custom dashboard so that management can see pretty graphs<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:13:55] &lt;cgibbons&gt; with MySQL it would be really tempting to have once instance by the write-instance and then use MySQL replication to allow other instances to get the data and be the ones that do the processing<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:13:57] &lt;tiredofme&gt; so I'm concerned that there will be a push to collect almost every metric<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:14:02] &lt;ericenns&gt; mray: I tried a random svn website and I succeded but not dev zenoss ones<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:14:15] &lt;mray&gt; ericenns: crazy...<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:14:25] &lt;cgibbons&gt; if you just want custom, pretty graphs....<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:14:34] &lt;cgibbons&gt; you can get the data from RRD in real-time via&#160; an xmlrpc API<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:14:52] &lt;tiredofme&gt; using getrrd()?<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:14:55] &lt;ericenns&gt; mray: yeah it's weird maybe if I try later on it will work<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:14:59] &lt;cgibbons&gt; so if you wanted to watch 10 data points on&#160; your dashboard, you could just grab that data then, format it using your fancy tool, then you don't have to store it<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:15:47] &lt;tiredofme&gt; i think theyre more concerned with being able to compare it to data, lets say 3 months back<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:16:05] &lt;tiredofme&gt; as opposed to just having the graphs accessible<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:16:17] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yeah, so a real reporting dashboard then<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:16:21] &lt;tiredofme&gt; exactly<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:16:28] &lt;tiredofme&gt; on a shoe-string budget<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:16:45] &lt;cgibbons&gt; they should totally fire you and use the saved $ to pay for enterprise then!<br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:16:49] &lt;cgibbons&gt; er wait, did i say that outloud? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[20-Oct-2010 16:16:58] &lt;tiredofme&gt;

or i see traffic, lets see what verbose gives us<br/>[22-Oct-2010 10:59:54] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; if you dont see traffic from ubuntu IP to zenoss IP then its not responding<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:00:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; at that point i'd run snmpd in debug mode to see if its seeing anything<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:00:22] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; also check any firewall rules<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:00:55] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; i know its not firewall related<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:01:02] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; again, if i reboot the server<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:01:05] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; it works fine for about 12 hours<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:01:09] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; then it breaks again<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:01:20] &lt;Parabola|W&gt;

cant seem to find anything unusual in zope for this issue...<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:41:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not really impossible, but you have to use custom scripts to collect the data<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:41:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is a huge waste of time for something that should be simple<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:41:34] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:41:54] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i get the feeling the ironware management tools can 'read' these strings just fine<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:42:12] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; they seem to use them in place of real indices<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:42:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, still a dumb way to do it<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:42:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; they probably do it that way so that people will just give up and guy their software<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:42:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:42:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; buy*<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:43:10] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yep<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:43:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: do you use /devices/network/cisco for your cisco devices?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:44:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have /Devices/Network/Router/Cisco, /Devices/Network/Switch/Cisco, /Device/Network/Wireless/Cisco<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:46:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm, i didnt organize mine like that<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:46:30] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; cant really separate router and switch here at the lines are very messy if nonexistant<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:47:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so i have /devices/network/brocade, /devices/network/cisco (pre-created by some zenpack i think), and /devices/network/juniper (also created by some zenpack)<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:47:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:47:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I separate them as best I can, but both classes use the same template<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:47:55] mrayzenoss is now known as mray<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:47:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; except for the wireless stuff obviously<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:48:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the cisco asa stuff<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:48:08] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yep<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:48:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; inside say, cisco, i have model numbers<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:48:27] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; 2800, 7200, asa, etc<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:50:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't bother with that since we monitor so many different models<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:50:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; we've got almost everything under the sun lol<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:50:56] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i usually wouldnt either, but at least with cisco stuff (not so much juniper and brocade), i need some custom templates due to mib differences<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:51:08] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; like... temperature sensors are not the same oid on 2800 and 7200<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:51:35] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hopefully the zenoss support folks will tell me what's broken in my /devices/network/cisco sub-device tree<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:51:39] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its super weird<br/>[22-Oct-2010 11:51:47] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; and apparently broken in my 2.4.1 prod install too<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:07:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; define "broken"<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:09:38] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; can't copy a template into that tree<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:09:44] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; it just doesnt show up in the list<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:09:58] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i dont recall seeing this in 3<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:11:02] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; lol sam<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:11:07] &lt;Parabola|W&gt;

cgibbons,&#160; i got tired of trying to fix snmp<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:11:43] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; it would stop responding after a biz day or so<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:11:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; what ver of ubuntu were you using before?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:11:47] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; 9.04<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:11:51] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; restarting snmpd didnt fix it<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:12:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; any bug reports on that?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:12:43] &lt;Parabola|W&gt; dont know<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:12:44] &lt;Parabola|W&gt;

like after two weeks of uptime, a system load of 125.5<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:13:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i havent had issues with snmp on linux, but on other platforms... bleeeeggghhhh<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:13:14] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; uh<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:13:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; seems any platform where a commercial ($) application is available for monitoring, the vendor seems to make snmp suck.<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:14:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; unless their app uses snmp, of course, but even then you get some weird stuff (like strings)<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:16:22] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i think the vendors make everything suck at some level<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:16:29] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yes.<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:16:34] &lt;cgibbons&gt; it's enterprise software: it's not supposed to be good, just useful<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:16:43] &lt;Simon4&gt; can't sell professional services if your product is awesome<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:17:38] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; depends<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:17:46] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i tend to like professional support on stuff<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:17:54] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; but it depends on the stuff<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:18:31] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; for a lot of my gear, support is purely for hardware RMA and firmware upgrades... not so much configuration questions or bug issues<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:19:06] &lt;jmp242&gt; Hmm, SNMP works great for me on most things I'm trying, then again, it's basically servers. . .<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:22:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; snmp works fine for me on network gear, but we're not monitoring much more than the default stuff<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:22:52] &lt;jmp242&gt; Yea, it's also good for my access points<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:23:05] &lt;jmp242&gt; I will mention that it sucks on the cheaper procurves, but that's HPs fault<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:23:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I monitor some procurves, but the expensive ones lol<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:24:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; I remember seeing an HP switch that didn't actually provide proper interface names via snmp<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:24:10] &lt;Orv&gt; So, can you monitor a Windows XP box using WMI?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:24:15] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yep<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:24:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; ifDescription would be something like "Ethernet Interface" and then ifName would be ""<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:24:28] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; mmm, i have some hp stuff to monitor<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:24:31] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; havent gotten to it yet<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:24:46] &lt;Orv&gt; Wonder why it doesn't answer..&#160;&#160; It's enabled, has administrative account, and firewall is off..<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:24:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; Orv: you can monitor basically anything above windows 98 using WMI<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:24:55] &lt;cgibbons&gt; disable simple file sharing?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:25:04] &lt;Orv&gt; rmatte: Cool..<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:25:07] &lt;Orv&gt; cgibbons: ??<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:25:22] &lt;cgibbons&gt; If it's not in a domain, you have to disable simple file sharing in the Control Panel -&gt; Folder Options applet.<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:25:26] &lt;jmp242&gt; simple file sharing is evil and breaks a lot of management stuff - but if you're in a domain<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:25:28] &lt;cgibbons&gt; It's a poorly named setting.<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:25:29] &lt;jmp242&gt; it's already off<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:25:46] &lt;cgibbons&gt; What it does is cause all DCE/RPC connections to use the Anonymous user, regardless of what credentials are provided.<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:29:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, poorly named like half of the stuff in windows<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:29:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:31:54] * Sam-I-Am notices zenhub quit running<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:32:07] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

no, using the Nagios check_http plugin<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:38:01] &lt;sciolist&gt; I see in the zencommand log that it removed a collection command earlier (a screw-up in binding the wrong template), but nothing after that<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:38:19] &lt;sciolist&gt; it should just be using ping and HTTP checks<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:42:44] &lt;sciolist&gt; could I run zencommand -v 10 -d &lt;hostname&gt;?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:42:56] &lt;sciolist&gt; err, zencommand run -v 10 -d &lt;hostname&gt;?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 12:43:28] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I want to do some research; if it was SQL I could build the selects but the data is in Zope.&#160; Where to go to understand Zope towards doing SQL'ish selects.<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:55:33] &lt;wvcain&gt; New to the object oriented database thing.<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:56:04] &lt;xuru&gt; I wish you can shift-select more then one entry in the events tab<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:56:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; xuru: they'll have that added back at some point<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:56:58] &lt;xuru&gt; combined with the select all bug...&#160; very annoying<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:57:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:57:09] &lt;cgibbons&gt; it's not annoying; it's really lame.<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:57:19] &lt;xuru&gt; hehe<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:57:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; the select all bug will be fixed in 3.0.3 I believe<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:57:21] &lt;cgibbons&gt; you can at least control-select events<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:57:32] &lt;xuru&gt; yeah<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:57:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but control-selecting events is a huge waste of time if you want to close like 30 of them<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:57:57] &lt;cgibbons&gt; oh yes<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:57:59] &lt;xuru&gt; exactly<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:58:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; then shift select was nice while it lasted<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:58:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; would be nice to see it fixed and re-implemented<br/>[22-Oct-2010 17:58:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; s/then/the<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:00:12] &lt;mray&gt; even though it was broken?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:00:20] &lt;xuru&gt; yeah, especially when bigegor's zenpacks goes crazy and adds 50 at a time&#160; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/>&#160; j/k<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:02:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: the fact that it was broken didn't affect me personally since I don't actually use the event console unless I'm doing development work, or just clearing events out for whatever reason<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:02:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that's why I said that it would be nice for it to be fixed and re-implemented<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:03:25] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: yeah, unfortunately it's one of those things that will probably remain unfixed<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:03:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; then they should add checkboxes for selecting events so that people can at least use things like checkboxmate<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:04:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's one thing I miss about the old console, the checkmarks<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:04:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:04:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm going to miss it big time for things like interfaces<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:04:47] &lt;xuru&gt; seriously?&#160; My boss is holding off buying enterprise because of some of these UI issues...<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:05:07] &lt;xuru&gt; well, and the price, but...<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:05:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I think it would be more the price combined with the bugs lol<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:05:40] &lt;mray&gt; xuru: I just meant it's a low priority compared to fixing bugs and adding features<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:05:49] &lt;xuru&gt; yeah, but if I was going to spend 20k on a product, it should just work<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:06:13] &lt;mray&gt; heh, that's what everybody thinks<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:06:17] &lt;mray&gt; all software has bugs<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:06:24] &lt;xuru&gt; mray: I agree that everything needs to be prioritized.&#160; It's just these kind of things are highly visible<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:06:24] &lt;mray&gt; even when you pay millions for it<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:06:34] &lt;cgibbons&gt; the more it costs the more horrible bugs it has<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:06:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but most software projects don't give bugs the back seat to adding features<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:07:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's the other way around<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:07:04] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i do think for all teh time we've spent discussing this particular issue (it comes up a LOT internally) we coul dhave fixed it a few times over, alas<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:07:24] &lt;xuru&gt; hehe, true<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:07:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I suppose microsoft does, but I certainly wouldn't model myself after them<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:07:34] &lt;cgibbons&gt; mmmmmm i've never worked at a software company were that is actually true<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:07:36] &lt;xuru&gt; Maybe I'll have a look at it soon<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:08:22] &lt;cgibbons&gt; the quality bar moves between companies, and what&#160; qualifies as an important enough defect moves, but features always come first... sometimes you get lucky and have a release that's a fixin' release, but it's pretty rare<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:08:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: you really think that projects like firefox would put off fixing usability bugs in favour of adding new features?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:08:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; they do in fact<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:08:49] &lt;xuru&gt; it's all about sales<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:09:00] &lt;cgibbons&gt; you can just go look through their bugzilla to see that<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:09:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; Well if they do they do a mighty good job of hiding it<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:09:12] &lt;cgibbons&gt; they do, however, have users that actually contribute and fix those core bugs instead of just stuff like zenpacks <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:09:27] &lt;cgibbons&gt; (that's a hint, egor)<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:09:31] &lt;cgibbons&gt; get to work!<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:09:34] &lt;mray&gt; and with that&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; I'm out of here<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:09:34] &lt;xuru&gt; hehe<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:09:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; seeya matt<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:09:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:09:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; later<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:09:43] &lt;xuru&gt; later<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:10:53] &lt;xuru&gt; why is it that when I bring up the details on an event, it sometimes says:&#160; Unable to connect to the server and wants me to reload the page?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:11:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I get that a lot too<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:11:12] * rmatte shrugs<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:11:18] &lt;xuru&gt; usually with snmp traps<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:11:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; another bug probably<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:11:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; who knows<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:11:29] &lt;cgibbons&gt; huh<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:12:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: I'll be working with the event console and then I get a "Unable to connect to the server" popup and I have to refresh the page to continue using the event console<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:12:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; It happens at least a couple of times a day to me<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:12:13] &lt;xuru&gt; hmm... how do I get it to give me a better trap message then "snmp trap synoptic.6.1.5.0.31"?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:12:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I don't even use the event console as heavily as most<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:12:27] &lt;cgibbons&gt; that sucks, no traceback spam in the z2.log when that happens?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:12:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; not that I've seen<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:12:42] &lt;xuru&gt; when it happens to me (like the trap) it's consistant<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:12:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll have to check next time it happens<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:13:00] &lt;cgibbons&gt; if either you have firebug, try it with that enabled, you should see a specific connection fail there when it does<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:13:14] &lt;cgibbons&gt; it would be interesting to know if the URL got munged or something like that, or if the server is returning some http error code<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:13:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, good pointer, I'll check that too<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:14:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; counter datasource + threshold = 2 events no matter what<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:14:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; even though the counter only increased on the first polling cycle<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:15:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh well, guess our event counts will just be inaccurate<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:16:15] &lt;xuru&gt; ok, so I got that server exception and firebug open<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:16:26] &lt;xuru&gt; what is it you wanted to see?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:17:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; look for a connection fail<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:17:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; and look for abnormalities in the URL<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:17:17] &lt;cgibbons&gt; you'll need to be in the Net tab of firebug, should h ave said that, too<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:17:32] &lt;cgibbons&gt; also for you,since it's happening more often, see if there's any spam in Z2.log<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:19:26] &lt;xuru&gt; ok, no spam in the logs<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:19:31] &lt;xuru&gt; I have the net info<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:20:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; pastebin the net info<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:20:01] &lt;xuru&gt; wow, this is pretty slick<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:20:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, firebug is pimp<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:20:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; I use it all the time<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:20:41] &lt;xuru&gt;

otrs is working<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:22:07] &lt;xuru&gt; is that what you wanted to see?<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:22:44] &lt;xuru&gt; there were two that had Internal Server Error<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:23:54] &lt;cgibbons&gt; ok so a&#160; http 500 back, so yeah that definitely means zope had some sort of error<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:24:03] &lt;cgibbons&gt; so there should really be some spam in your Z2log or something<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:24:13] &lt;xuru&gt; http://paste.pocoo.org/show/279011/<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:24:20] &lt;xuru&gt; nothing<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:24:59] &lt;xuru&gt; that post is the response from that POST<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:25:09] &lt;cgibbons&gt; looka bs hem<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:25:15] &lt;cgibbons&gt; er, looks bad, hmm<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:26:10] &lt;cgibbons&gt; that might be happening from some data in an event that has some unicode decoding problems, that would xplain the behavior you're seeing<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:26:17] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i think i recall hearing about something like that in a defect review recently<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:26:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; It appears to be erroring on...<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:26:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; Products/ZenUI3/browser/resources/js/deploy/zenoss-compiled.js<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:27:01] &lt;rmatte&gt;

there's a way to get the friendly version<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:28:08] &lt;cgibbons&gt; if you're running in debug mode, it uses the non-compiled version of the javascript<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:28:12] &lt;cgibbons&gt; slower, but it's not compressed<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:29:55] &lt;cgibbons&gt; xuru: if you can get it to happen consistently by opening up a specific event, open a defect with that event detail if you can, it'll be a big clue<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:30:02] &lt;cgibbons&gt; must go, have a weekend<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:30:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; pretty sure he meant "have a good weekend"<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:30:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:31:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; xuru: if you run in debug mode and get another network tab dump we can probably pinpoint exactly what part of the javascript it's choking on<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:37:38] &lt;xuru&gt; k, I have to get going... maybe tomorrow<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:38:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:38:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; later<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:38:06] &lt;xuru&gt; thanks though<br/>[22-Oct-2010 18:38:20] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Looks like anything I add externally gets that error?<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:04:41] &lt;nickanderson&gt; rmatte: no .0 is appeneded to that oid<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:04:59] &lt;ianAtWork&gt; I'm using the the 2.6 .eggs<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:05:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; nickanderson: then I have no idea, the way Zenoss queries snmp is different than snmpwalk<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:05:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; like I said, you need the exact OID, so something is wrong with the OID<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:06:00] &lt;nickanderson&gt; that oid works on other devices<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:06:04] &lt;nickanderson&gt; (F5 load balancer)<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:06:15] &lt;nickanderson&gt; same software rev<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:06:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; then perhaps that 1 specific device has a different OID with something different than .0<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:06:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; argh<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:06:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; indexes can vary from device to device<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:06:47] &lt;nickanderson&gt; but it works when i query the same oid on multiple devices manually<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:06:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; another thing you can try is lowering the zMaxOIDPerRequest property for that device<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:07:04] &lt;nickanderson&gt; k<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:07:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; it defaults to 40, lower it to 10<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:07:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, querying them manually uses snmpwalk though<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:07:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss doesn't use snmpwalk, it uses twisted<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:07:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; twisted is more sensitive about OIDs<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:08:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; for instance, I might do an snmpwalk on 1.2.3.4.5 on one device and see a value of 1.2.3.4.5.0, but on another device it might be 1.2.3.4.5.22<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:08:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; it depends on how the indexing is done<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:08:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it's not static then it'll vary from device to device<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:08:47] &lt;nickanderson&gt; Right, these are static<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:09:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, then zMaxOIDPerRequest is your best bet<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:09:07] &lt;nickanderson&gt; ok thanks<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:09:09] &lt;nickanderson&gt; trying it now<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:09:18] &lt;rmatte&gt;

willwh: perhaps the template is actually in /Server/Windows?<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:15:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; willwh: templates can be at different levels, you won't see them at higher levels if they are at a lower level<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:15:22] &lt;sciolist&gt;

Anyone?&#160; A quick hint as to why I get Server Exception and TypeErrors with every ZenPack I install?<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:16:20] &lt;nickanderson&gt; so the situation is I have 2 load balancers, I have a template that collects information on a bunch of these oids<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:16:24] &lt;nickanderson&gt; they work fine.<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:16:38] &lt;sciolist&gt; I've seen that OID nomenclature before, too (IP == oid_index)<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:16:40] &lt;willwh&gt; rmatte: odd, seems that no matter which template I look at, I see no available templates<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:16:44] &lt;willwh&gt;

rmatte: guessing at some stage someone hit "reset bindings" at the device classes level<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:18:46] &lt;ianAtWork&gt; Orv, yes I am.&#160; THe installation doesn't show any errors, the problems appear after I try to bind a template to a device<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:18:50] &lt;willwh&gt; I don't see any available templates at any point<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:18:57] &lt;nickanderson&gt; So since that dosnt seem to be working is there any easy way to "add" two graphs?<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:19:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; cgibbons: ping<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:20:09] &lt;Orv&gt; ianAtWork: And you restarted Zenoss after installing the Zenpacks?<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:20:17] &lt;ianAtWork&gt; Is ZenOSS sensitive to DNS?&#160; Eg, does the machine it is installed on actually need a working fwd/rev DNS entry?<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:20:42] &lt;ianAtWork&gt; Orv, No I didn't restart ZenOSS.&#160; I wasn't aware that this was a required step.&#160; Let me try that and I'll get back to you.&#160; Hang on.<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:21:02] &lt;jmp242&gt; ianAtWork: Zenoss itself will resolve certain DNS entries, though you can use straight IP addresses<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:21:17] &lt;cgibbons&gt; que?<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:21:21] &lt;jmp242&gt; but if you've used localhost for the Zenoss server itself, and not a FQDN that doesn't resolve<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:21:47] &lt;jmp242&gt; it should be fine in my experience - though then you have to specify, say SNMP permissions via IP and not FQDN<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:22:33] &lt;willwh&gt; rmatte: yeah - if I go and look at the Detail for any Template, the only thing in zDeviceTemplates is "Device"<br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:22:36] &lt;willwh&gt; doh <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[25-Oct-2010 14:22:43] &lt;willwh&gt;

like zproperties?<br/>[27-Oct-2010 11:33:59] &lt;Parabola&gt; if so, no you can modify the class or the device its self, if you do the device make sure you push changes back to the collector<br/>[27-Oct-2010 11:34:27] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its more like interface graphing templates<br/>[27-Oct-2010 11:34:45] &lt;Parabola&gt; o<br/>[27-Oct-2010 11:35:02] &lt;Parabola&gt; i dont know for sure, but if you want to modify a template i would say yes<br/>[27-Oct-2010 11:35:09] &lt;Parabola&gt;

sooooon?<br/>[27-Oct-2010 11:40:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; There are no fixes for template handling in it though<br/>[27-Oct-2010 11:40:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's mostly backend stuff<br/>[27-Oct-2010 11:41:56] &lt;rmatte&gt;

what's the last version to do zip packs? it was pre 2.5<br/>[27-Oct-2010 12:35:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; pretty sure 2.5 can do it, but 2.4 is your best bet<br/>[27-Oct-2010 12:35:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm trying to find the guide for eggifying zenpacks, hold on...<br/>[27-Oct-2010 12:35:53] &lt;theacolyte&gt;

that works...<br/>[28-Oct-2010 10:18:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i tend to poke around the zope db... its often not useful<br/>[28-Oct-2010 10:18:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it can be<br/>[28-Oct-2010 10:18:38] &lt;rmatte&gt;

well Nick, this is an open source software<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:17:06] &lt;themactech&gt; so you will get tons of people using a free product, then bitch they are not getting their money's worth<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:17:10] &lt;themactech&gt; lol<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:17:32] &lt;twm1010&gt; Yeah, I hope you're ready for some insanely obscure and detailed bug finding adventures<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:18:10] &lt;xuru&gt; mray: wow, wish you the best of luck<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:19:44] &lt;mray&gt; Yeah, it was a hard decision, but Nick's been getting the firehose of knowledge for nearly a week now<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:19:55] &lt;xuru&gt; theacolyte: hehe, lol<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:21:00] &lt;xuru&gt; why did they have to name it Chef?&#160; or Puppet for that matter...&#160; you can't search on those names<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:21:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; simple and catchy<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:21:15] &lt;mray&gt; xuru: yeah, they know #opschef is the tag<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:21:30] &lt;xuru&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:21:41] &lt;mray&gt; I plan on working on the Zenoss cookbook next week<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:22:05] &lt;nyeates&gt; and they get to brand things cool like "recipes" and "cookbooks"<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:22:12] &lt;xuru&gt; mray: are you going to do it on-line?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:22:22] &lt;xuru&gt; hehe<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:22:58] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: i'm guessing app.acl_users is 'hidden' as it doesnt show up in tab completion, but its there if i type it in manually...<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:23:28] &lt;xuru&gt; http://brainspl.at/articles/2009/01/15/chef-suck-on-my-chocolate-salty-balls<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:23:36] &lt;nyeates&gt; yeah i found that many things dont always show up for tab completion in DMD<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:24:50] &lt;nyeates&gt; not that that helps :-/ just ive seen the same thing<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:25:08] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; heh<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:26:28] &lt;xuru&gt; damn it, I guess I'm going to have to look into chef more...<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:27:33] &lt;Parabola&gt; good morning<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:27:37] &lt;Parabola&gt;

mray: do they have plans to support windows (as sorry I am to ask)?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:28:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: actually, it's below the dmd level<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:28:39] &lt;xuru&gt; mray: umm...&#160; never mind:&#160; http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation+on+Windows<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:28:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: but yeh, you can't access it from the zope management interface<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:30:02] &lt;kells&gt; zendmd tab completion has a list of things it doesn't automatically auto-complete because they tend to be annoying rather than useful (eg Zope crud).&#160; There's a list you can edit in ZenModel/zendmd.py if you're so inclined to get the extra goo.<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:30:26] &lt;nyeates&gt; thx kells<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:30:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'm guessing its possible to write a script that uses zendmd non-interactivly<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:30:48] &lt;rocket&gt; ignored_prefixes or ignored_names<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:30:58] &lt;kells&gt; As of 3.0.1, yes<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:31:03] &lt;kells&gt; zendmd --script=filename<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:31:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: docs/DOC-3217<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:31:36] &lt;Simon4&gt; Sam-I-Am: that or use the first few lines of the script I gave you earlier<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:31:41] &lt;Simon4&gt; is just connecting to dmd<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:31:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's what I just pasted<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:31:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:32:05] &lt;Simon4&gt;

Keep in mind that it's pretty much an exact duplicate of typing things on the command-line, so you can't have extra newlines in loops etc, and the last line needs a newline<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:32:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; thats what i was thinking...<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:32:23] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; thx<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:32:25] &lt;kells&gt; Also, there's another option to do a commit at the end: zendmd --script --commit<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:32:48] &lt;rocket&gt; I would recommend writing a script using the zenscriptbase libraries ..<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:35:33] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; mray - does your cookbook have "How to make reports work in V3"???????<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:35:41] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; This is still a black art to me<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:35:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; I haven't messed with reports yet in v3<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:36:23] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; Some work - some don't<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:36:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; I didn't think the reports system really changed in v3<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:36:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; I heard mumblings yesterday about an add-on reporting product, might be pay-for only though<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:36:51] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; My problem, like I suspect, many others, is that you build a ZenPack largely by copying "other stuff"<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:36:57] &lt;mray&gt; Jane_Curry: alas, I'll be at the mercy of Zenoss development<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:37:02] &lt;themactech&gt; I have a question regarding dmd scripting, first of all, the manufacturer database (including products) is in there correct?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:37:24] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; .. not necessarily knowing quite what everything does<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:37:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; Jane_Curry: yeh, that's pretty much the way I feel too<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:37:49] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; I find the words in the 3.0 Dev Guide start 2 levels deeper than I can start<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:37:49] &lt;Simon4&gt; themactech: yes<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:38:04] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; It needs a "Dummies guide to Zenpacks on v3"<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:38:16] &lt;themactech&gt; there is no low level docs on many of the things you need to know for custom compnonents, right now I'm using Jane's doc on BRIDGE zenpack to try and figure it out, btw thanks for that doc Jane<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:38:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; It needs sort of an "exploded view" as it were, where each piece of the ZenPack structure is explained<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:38:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; "This is the skins folder, blah blah blah"<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:38:44] &lt;mray&gt; twm1010: there is definitely going to be a new reporting product with the next release, it will be a commercial add-on, it's packaging is still TBD but it may be available as an add-on for Core<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:38:52] &lt;themactech&gt; ok, so if the manufacturer database is in the DMD, there should be a way to script creating new manufacturers and/or products, correct?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:39:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: If it's not an add-on for Core, is core going to just have the same old reports or will it have zero reporting?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:39:18] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; when you say an add-on for Core, is that a CHARGEABLE add-on??<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:39:41] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: it's an add-on for Core and Enterprise, which will both still have the same reports<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:39:46] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; zero reporting will kill core<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:39:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:39:56] &lt;mray&gt; reporting isn't changing essentially<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:40:23] &lt;themactech&gt; I want to be able to do this from a modeler.&#160; I want a modeler to get the model info from and SNMP OID, query the products database for that manufacturer, and if it doesn't get a hit on that key, creates it, so the product key database self-updates<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:40:48] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; mray:&#160; when you say an add-on for Core, is that a CHARGEABLE add-on??<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:40:58] &lt;mray&gt; Jane_Curry: that's the plan<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:41:11] &lt;mray&gt; so Core users can buy the reporting package without going to Enterprise<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:41:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; themactech: well, the only common thing for model info is an OID, you'd have to translate it with the appropriate Mibs.<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:41:27] &lt;themactech&gt; wasn't reporting included in core before?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:41:28] &lt;mray&gt; it uses a 3rd party tool we can't package<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:41:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; themactech: model info being stored in plaintext is not a standard for devices<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:41:41] &lt;mray&gt; themactech: the existing reporting will continue to be there<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:41:46] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; but if they have no budget then they don't get any new functionality (unless they write it)<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:42:07] &lt;themactech&gt; rmatte: that would not apply here, these modelers are manufacturer specific, and I know which oid give me a real model name<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:42:32] &lt;mray&gt; Jane_Curry: agreed, the existing reporting will be supported and have bugs fixed, but probably no new features<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:42:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; themactech: have a look at the CiscoMap plugin, it does something similar, but for serial number<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:42:37] &lt;themactech&gt; so after my OID pull from the modeler, I know its a MacBookPro Late 2010, and I know it will be Apple, since its the Apple modeler<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:42:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; themactech: then you'd just need to figure out the code to actually create the product<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:43:14] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm... this could work better though<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:43:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; the reporting is what most people are missing and are willing to pay for<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:43:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; as long as it's a fraction of the cost of enterprise, i think it would get a lot of interest<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:43:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt they will provide the reporting as a paid module for Core<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:43:57] &lt;themactech&gt; I just want to avoid having to log into 15 different zenoss servers and have to add the "MacBook Pro late 2010" to all the databases<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:43:59] &lt;kells&gt; themactech: Yes, but if you want to add things you can edit them in the UI, associate them with a zenpack and then plunk them into the objects.xml<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:44:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; It'll be all or nothing<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:44:17] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; OK - so for dummies like me, we still nedd a "Dummies guide to reporting in Zenoss 3.0"<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:44:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; themactech: welcome to my pain<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:44:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:44:31] &lt;mray&gt; twm1010: no commitment on prices yet, but what is a reasonable price in your mind?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:45:10] &lt;themactech&gt; kells, : I understand, but say I deploy this zenpack today at 10 sites, and 2 months from now, Apple releases the "MacBook Pro early 2011", I don't want to have to update product databases at 10 sites<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:45:30] &lt;kells&gt; Jane_Curry: Reporting hasn't changed in Zenoss 3.0, at least, not AFAIK.&#160; What's the specific pain point?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:45:40] &lt;themactech&gt; and to do so every time Apple releases new hardware, or software for that matter, I want the software database to auto-update as well<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:45:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; mray: I'd have to think about that a little<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:46:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; themactech: I just update the product databases as necessary on all my servers, it's way too much work to do it any other way, and there's no foolproof way to do it for every possible type of device<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:46:49] &lt;kells&gt; IIRC, Chet dropped in some code (err... I *think*, and I think in 3.0.0) to allow that to happen automatically on a model.<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:46:57] &lt;kells&gt; If it doesn't then I'm thinking of a different ticket<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:47:45] &lt;themactech&gt; I find that I need to make custom modelers for most of the gear I have to keep an eye on, always a little thing missing.<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:48:03] &lt;rocket&gt; kells: there is a snmp manufacturer script to update the manufacturers<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:48:07] &lt;themactech&gt; Or some extra info the client wants us to display/track<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:48:29] &lt;themactech&gt; On big feature I want to add is warranty tracking<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:48:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; you're talking about mapping the OID to an actual product name?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:48:41] &lt;themactech&gt; oid value<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:48:51] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; themactech: how do you monitor laptops since they come and go so often?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:49:07] &lt;rocket&gt; well there is a database of manufacturers that map to the snmp address space they were assigned<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:49:21] &lt;themactech&gt; we mostly monitor servers and infrastructure<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:49:25] &lt;rocket&gt; most likely that is out of date<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:49:50] &lt;themactech&gt; I do have some workstations to monitor, I disabled some stuff so I don't get alerts when they get restarted<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:50:32] &lt;twm1010&gt; it would be nice if you could subscribe to something that kept that database up to date<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:51:09] &lt;rocket&gt; its supposed to auto populate with the information it finds<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:51:12] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; kells: I have no success at all on V3 with my updated groupReporting ZenPack referenced here docs/DOC-5898<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:51:13] &lt;themactech&gt; in my case for my Apple modeler, since the real model designation you want doesn't reside on the machine anywhere, I have extended the net-snmp to query Apple's web site with the serial number and that is where I get the "MacBook Pro late 2010" model name, that is what they use in all their tech docs, and that info is nowhere in any of the system files or registry<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:51:50] &lt;themactech&gt; instead the system info on the mac will call your machine MacBookPro 8,1<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:51:56] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; cool<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:51:56] &lt;themactech&gt; which means nothing to most people<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:52:28] &lt;themactech&gt; So at my sites, they can look up parts on Apple GSX web site and match it with the info on the zenoss status page<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:52:32] &lt;mray&gt; twm1010: it's still under consideration for whether it'll be available for purchase with Core, we're just trying to gauge interest<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:52:58] &lt;mray&gt; I think it should, since there are a heck of a lot of Core users<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:53:09] &lt;rocket&gt; themactech: you can attach your modeller changes to a trac ticket for possible inclusion in the product and maintenance by zenoss<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:53:15] &lt;mray&gt; but I'm becoming one of them tomorrow<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:53:36] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'm interested in better reporting... although one particular possibly-not-related need is ability to limit reports to users and also give them specific permissions with them<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:53:55] &lt;themactech&gt; my only problem is my boss won't authorize me to post most stuff I'm working on since it's corporate intellectual property<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:54:21] &lt;themactech&gt; Just a good zenpack with good warranty tracking would really be a good add<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:54:38] &lt;themactech&gt; but I've asked some questions here before that I needed answers to and got no responses<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:54:44] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i wonder how many people actually have enterprise in large installations<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:55:09] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; only reason i have enterprise is for ACLs... which... are not very configurable.<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:55:25] &lt;themactech&gt; The only features from enterprise I could see worth paying money for are remote collectors, and directory system hook up, both of which I have working on core<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:55:31] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; although going to distibuted collectors soon is another reason<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:55:55] &lt;themactech&gt; there are many docs in the forums on getting collectors working with core<br/>[28-Oct-2010 11:56:00] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

hmmm<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:36:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; obviously a library issue, possibly a library path issue for root<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:36:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm checking the env variables to see what's different between the 2 users...<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:36:54] &lt;Parabola&gt; yeah i dont actually get the segfault echoed out to me like that<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:37:00] &lt;Parabola&gt; just the version info line<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:37:08] &lt;Parabola&gt; the segfault stuff is in the syslog<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:37:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but it's the same segfault basically from the sounds of it<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:38:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if I can figure out what's causing it that could be the answer<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:38:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; looks like it could be the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env variable<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:38:59] &lt;Parabola&gt; id still like to know how a zenoss stack installer breaks it<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:39:05] &lt;Parabola&gt; that makes no sense<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:39:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I'd like to know that too, but first we need to identify where the issue is<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:39:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you type env as root, is LD_LIBRARY_PATH defined?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:39:29] &lt;Parabola&gt;

you said it killed your ssh session, how were you logged in during your install when that happened? not the VMware console in that case.<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:58:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; you weren't sshing in to the box as the zenoss user and then sudoing to root?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:59:53] &lt;Parabola&gt; remember my vm being hosed<br/>[28-Oct-2010 14:59:56] &lt;Parabola&gt; that was doing it over ssh<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:00:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, but how did you login via ssh?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:00:05] &lt;Parabola&gt; i was smarter the next time, i did it from the vmware console<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:00:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; directly to the root account?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:00:10] &lt;Parabola&gt; YES<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:00:18] &lt;Parabola&gt; look this maybe user error<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:00:25] &lt;Parabola&gt; but its not related to me installing the stack, or sshing<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:00:30] &lt;Parabola&gt; i can fking restore the vm<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:00:34] &lt;Parabola&gt;

i logged in as root like i always do<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:01:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; theoretically, had you ssh'd in directly as the zenoss user, then sudoed to root from that user it could mess things up<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:01:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's all we were asking<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:01:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok...<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:01:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm still working on figuring out where the heck these env variables are coming from in the stack install<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:01:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; the .bashrc is clean<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:01:53] &lt;Parabola&gt; got me man<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:02:28] Simon4_ is now known as Simon4<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:02:30] &lt;Parabola&gt; i guess restore teh snapshot, save the env<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:02:33] &lt;Parabola&gt;

pretty sure the intaller just populates ~zenoss/.bashrc<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:53:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I thought so too, but I've checked ~/.bashrc for the zenoss user<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:53:42] &lt;rmatte&gt;

weird that grep didn't pick it up<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:56:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, when I grep for it it doesn't find it, hmm<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:57:04] &lt;ericenns&gt; updatedb?<br/>[28-Oct-2010 15:57:36] &lt;cgibbons&gt;

for sure<br/>[29-Oct-2010 09:56:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; if there's no change in the value it should be 0<br/>[29-Oct-2010 09:57:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; http://oi55.tinypic.com/6f1202.jpg<br/>[29-Oct-2010 09:58:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: so... for those of us not python rockstars, how do you generally find where zenoss hides stuff?&#160; for example... what functions it calls to update the user password from the web interface (and hence where you found it in zendmd) ... i suppose theres some sort of rhyme or reason.<br/>[29-Oct-2010 09:58:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what the graph looks like<br/>[29-Oct-2010 09:58:29] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ha, wow<br/>[29-Oct-2010 09:58:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not really a python rockstar.&#160; I mostly just dig through source code, and use the zendmd tab completion to find stuff<br/>[29-Oct-2010 09:58:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; when all else fails I ask a dev<br/>[29-Oct-2010 09:59:04] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i guess what i'm asking is how you find stuff in the fairly large source tree... lots of directories and other goodies.<br/>[29-Oct-2010 09:59:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's basically figuring out what script in the UI does what you're wanting to do<br/>[29-Oct-2010 09:59:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; then going in to that script and finding the relevant portion of code<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:00:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's really the best way to figure it out<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:00:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; http://oi54.tinypic.com/r22knl.jpg<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:00:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what why other graph looks like<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:00:49] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i think the key for me is relating what i'm seeing in the UI to a script within zenoss...<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:00:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; it was going crazy too then finally leveled out<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:01:17] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm... weird that its just jittery<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:01:28] &lt;Simon4&gt; Sam-I-Am: turn on live http headers in firefox and watch the calls made when you change a password <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:01:37] &lt;Simon4&gt; is what I do when I get really desperate<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:02:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you can also get in to the zope management interface and dig around to try and figure it out<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:02:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not always easy<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:02:13] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i just figured there was some magical way...<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:02:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; sometimes stuff is hopelessly buried<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:02:15] &lt;rmatte&gt;

nice<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:02:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; and when I do figure out how to do something I document it<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:03:05] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: it'd be weird if inside your rrd file, the values are the same, yet rrdtool graphs it as not a straight line<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:03:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I have a lot of stuff memorized<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:03:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: well, I'll dump the values and see<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:05:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, the values are changing in the RRD<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:05:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; so Zenoss is screwing up somehow with it's collection (is the only explanation I can come up with)<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:05:37] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; time to sniff some packets<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:05:48] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

It's just strange that it's only doing it for 1 type of interface<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:18:00] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; just specify the specific host and snmp port... should limit it to at least that device.<br/>[29-Oct-2010 10:18:02] &lt;rmatte&gt;
