then submit<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:04:26] &lt;zykes-&gt; the ip is still there..<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:04:34] &lt;zykes-&gt; under ip address<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:04:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; try putting a space then clicking submit<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:04:50] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you know, if you have zPingMonitorIgnore enabled for the class that the devices are in, you can always just assign each device the same IP (the one that resolves to the hostname)<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:06:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; that works as well<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:07:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh I see why, yeh, in 3.0 they have this "Blank to use DNS" option<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:07:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; just set the IP to the IP that the hostname resolves to<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:07:27] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I have a couple devices that are being monitored via ping.&#160; Currently they are resolving to an incorrect IP address.&#160; I assume if I chose 'reset ip' and just fill in the correct IP that will be enough for zenoss to avoid DNS resolution?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:28:18] &lt;elc0_work&gt; or are there properties somewhere that will ensure that DNS is avoided<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:33:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, just set an IP<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:33:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; it doesn't automatically go looking for IP addresses unless you tell it to or you're initially adding a device<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:34:54] bzed_ is now known as bzed<br/>[01-Dec-2010 12:38:00] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Has anyone been able to get the libvirt ZenPack to work in 3.0.3?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:32:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I haven't tried<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:32:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't think it's been officially tested with 3.0<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:33:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; the components in it probably haven't been updated to work with the new UI<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:34:38] &lt;evilliger&gt; It hasn't, but I'm just testing it on my test zenoss install.&#160; I've hacked it a little so it can work with older versions of libvirt.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:34:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; what are you looking to monitor with it?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:35:02] &lt;evilliger&gt; Howerver, it doesn't work when you try to model a device.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:35:41] &lt;evilliger&gt; my Xen guest VM's.&#160; I provides more info than the VirtualHostMonitor and XenMonitor ZenPacks.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:35:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's really good for Xen<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:36:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should contact the author and see if they plan to update it<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:37:10] &lt;evilliger&gt; was planning to.&#160; I was just hoping that someone else hacked it too.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:39:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; doubt it <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:39:21] &lt;evilliger&gt;

luckily the majority of the more popular ones have active maintainers<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:50:41] &lt;Orbixx&gt; Question, probably more snmp-orientated I'm guessing... I'm just setting up snmp monitoring for what is essentially the first time.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 13:51:46] &lt;Orbixx&gt; Zenoss appears to grab local information fine but when I add a remote Linux server (which has snmp set up with 'rocommunity public &lt;zenossip&gt;'), it's only capable of basic device identification, how can I get it to grab info on disk partitions, CPU/memory usage and such?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:02:21] &lt;cgibbons&gt; hurm<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:11:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; Orbixx: your SNMP config on the Linux box is too restrictive<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:11:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; by default net-snmp has paranoid settings<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:11:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to adjust them<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:12:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; the default net-snmp config won't cut it.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:12:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; or is rocommunity public the only line in the config file?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:12:46] &lt;axelilly&gt; I'm trying to install the EsxTop zenpack...everything looks good, but when I model a ESX host, I do not see the modeler running the esx plugin and there are no guests showing for the device...any tips?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:13:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; axelilly: have you verified that the plugin is actually assigned to the device class?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:13:13] &lt;Orbixx&gt; rmatte: The config file literally just contains the line stated above.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:13:23] &lt;Orbixx&gt; 'rocommunity public'<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:13:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; Orbixx: you restarted snmpd after you put that line in?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:14:14] &lt;axelilly&gt; rmatte: yes, there is only one modeler assigned to EsxTop class:&#160; zenoss.cmd.esx.esxtop<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:15:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; Orbixx: You can try this config: http://fpaste.org/h6rT/raw/<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:15:34] &lt;Orbixx&gt; rmatte: Yes.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:15:54] &lt;axelilly&gt; rmatte: I watched the esxTop zenoss video, but it's not turning out the same <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:16:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; axelilly: I haven't tried the pack myself yet<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:17:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; you do have esxtop installed right?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:17:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; it doesn't come with the pack<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:17:28] &lt;axelilly&gt; rmatte: yea, just installed it<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:17:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you restart Zenoss after installing the ZenPack?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:17:53] &lt;axelilly&gt; rmatte: it's only pulling in data on the esx host, but I don't see the listing of the virtual machines on the host<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:17:58] &lt;axelilly&gt; rmatte: yep<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:18:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; permissions perhaps?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:18:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I didn't think esxtop did the guests as well<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:18:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; thought it was only for the host<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:18:56] &lt;axelilly&gt; rmatte: oh...I though it included the guests.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:19:06] * axelilly queues up the video again<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:19:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, that's what the new VMWare ESXi ZenPack by Eric Enns is for<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:19:35] &lt;axelilly&gt; rmatte: hmmm, maybe I got something confused<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:19:54] &lt;Orbixx&gt; rmatte: Ah, looks like it's beginning to work, but it's still incapable of fetching memory information.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:20:33] &lt;axelilly&gt;

Orbixx: did you try the config I provided?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:22:24] &lt;Orbixx&gt; rmatte: Yes, I'm saying it's began to graph some stuff, but not the memory and there's no sign of anything pertaining to partition info.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:22:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; you remodeled?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:23:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; partition info doesn't get automatically seen, you have to remodel the device<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:24:51] &lt;axelilly&gt; rmatte: yea, the VMs are supposed to show up under "Components"<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:25:00] &lt;Orbixx&gt; You'll have to forgive me, I'm terribly ignorant of Zenoss and snmp.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:25:12] &lt;Orbixx&gt; I'm not entirely sure what 'remodelling' is.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:25:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; axelilly: yeh not sure why they wouldn't be then, I'm watching the video right now<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:25:20] &lt;axelilly&gt; rmatte: In the video, when he models, something call PythonCommand runs....but when I remodel it doesn't.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:25:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; Orbixx: If you're on the device page, look at the bottom left<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:25:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's a gear menu<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:25:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; click on that<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:25:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; there will be an option to remodel<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:26:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; remodelling is the process where Zenoss goes out and actually discovers components on devices, such as processes, interfaces, filesystems, etc...<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:28:05] &lt;Orbixx&gt; Thanks rmatte.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:28:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:28:42] &lt;Orbixx&gt; INFO zen.ZenModeler: Skipping Physical memory (ram) as it matches zFileSystemMapIgnoreTypes.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 14:28:42] &lt;Orbixx&gt;

never had any hopes of actually using it<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:02:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's alright<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:03:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; honestly, I wouldn't trade Zenoss for anything else for 1 reason, transforms<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:03:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; nothing else that I've seen has anything that can compare<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:03:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've tried OpenNMS, Nagios<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:04:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; Groundworks (which is just Nagios wrapped in with a bunch of other stuff)<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:04:39] &lt;nyeates&gt; ive wanted to try some other competitors...i might set some up for comparison... i know tho with zenoss that u have to get into to it and know how everything is setup to really use effectively... but once that happens, zenoss is super effective<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:04:56] &lt;nyeates&gt; i wonder if other platforms are like that or not....if they need learning curves to really be useful<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:04:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it took me about a year to get good with Zenoss<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:05:00] &lt;Orbixx&gt; Hmm, I'm trying to create 'CentOS' as a manufacturer and add the OS versions so I can categorise the servers I add.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:05:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; and now that I've been at it for 2 years intensively I can almost do anything with it<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:05:30] &lt;Orbixx&gt; I've created them fine, but I can't alter the servers with them.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:05:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; Orbixx: make sure they are set to software<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:05:48] &lt;Orbixx&gt; It lets me select CentOS as the manufacturer, but the versions don't appear in 'OS Model'.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:05:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; and not hardware<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:05:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; Products can be either<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:05:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; and there's a setting on each product<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:06:00] &lt;Orbixx&gt; Even if I select the OS Manufacturer as CentOS, it doesn't save it.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:06:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; even if you select something below it?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:06:33] &lt;nyeates&gt; does it save it for a bit, and then when remodeled its gone?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:06:45] &lt;Orbixx&gt; rmatte: afaik they're 'OS's.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:06:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; try them as software instead<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:06:56] &lt;Orbixx&gt; not hardware<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:07:03] &lt;Orbixx&gt; There are 3 types listed<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:07:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; in my experience OS' don't work<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:07:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, try software<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:07:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; I noticed OS never shows up at all<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:07:19] &lt;Orbixx&gt; If I select something else, their OS versions load into the selection.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:07:22] &lt;Orbixx&gt; No.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:07:26] &lt;Orbixx&gt; It just plain doesn't save it.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:07:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:07:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; sounds like an old bug that was closed as "fixed"<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:07:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll dig up the trac ticket<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:07:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; after this Novell Moonlight install finishes<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:08:01] &lt;Orbixx&gt; The manufacturer appears, but the products underneath it do not; even if I simply save the manufacturer under a server, it doesn't take effect.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:08:11] * rmatte nods<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:08:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, the whole products thing has been messed up for a while<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:08:26] * Orbixx checks what the others are listed as<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:08:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, for as long as I can remember anyways<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:08:36] &lt;Orbixx&gt; The others are listed as 'Operating System' types and not software.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:08:44] &lt;Orbixx&gt; For example, under 'Debian'.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:08:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; well try OS then<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:09:06] &lt;nyeates&gt; yeah i agree with rmatte, the products and manufacturers has had defects in the past<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:09:13] &lt;nyeates&gt; especally when u add ones yerself<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:09:26] * rmatte nods<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:09:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; the auto-detection works fine<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:09:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; but adding manually doesn't work so well<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:09:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I remember when it was the complete opposite<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:09:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; in 2.3.3<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:10:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; the auto-detection didn't work at all<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:10:08] &lt;nyeates&gt; if either of u finds a directly related public trac ticket, and u are seeing this on 3.0.3....let me know and ill reopen<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:10:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; but setting it manually worked fine<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:10:11] &lt;Orbixx&gt; rmatte: Aha, apparently if you don't populate 'Product Keys' it will not show up.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:10:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; Product Keys eh?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:10:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:10:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll dig up the trac ticket that I'm thinking of once I can open firefox again<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:10:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:11:17] &lt;Orbixx&gt; Bit odd.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:11:18] &lt;nyeates&gt; PM me if u find so...im going away<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:11:28] &lt;Orbixx&gt; And mildly irritating.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:11:49] &lt;nyeates&gt;

that's the original issue is 2.5, I suspect elements of that are still lingering<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:21:48] &lt;axelilly&gt; I wish I knew how to improve one of these vmware zenpacks.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:22:19] &lt;axelilly&gt;

rmatte: I need to look into how to hack on this stuff<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:23:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, just unzip the .egg file<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:23:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; and look at the structure and scripts in it<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:24:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; a .egg file (ZenPack) is just a zip file with a specific structure<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:25:13] &lt;axelilly&gt; rmatte: checking it out<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:25:31] &lt;Orbixx&gt; Just added a CentOS server and received this on the event log: threshold of low CPU idle not met: current value 1.00<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:25:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; axelilly: you may be interested in this: http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/papers/jane/zenpacks/<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:25:47] * Orbixx is slightly confused<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:25:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; some of the data is a little outdated, but it's a good paper as a starting point<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:26:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; Orbixx: that means that the CPU was completely idle<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:26:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; Orbixx: I just disable that threshold<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:26:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; along with the swap threshold, since it's hardcoded at 1024<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:26:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is useless<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:27:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; I still need to make my own dynamic ones for Linux<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:27:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll be easy with my formula data source pack<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:28:04] &lt;Orbixx&gt;

well, some people might treat that as an indication that it isn't doing what it should be<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:28:44] &lt;Orbixx&gt; At least, it should be assumed an idle server isn't bad by default.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:28:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I don't personally see the value in it<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:28:51] &lt;Orbixx&gt; Could be bad in certain cases of usage.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:29:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; either way, it's easy to edit the template and remove the threshold<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:29:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; so no big deal<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:29:09] &lt;Orbixx&gt; mhmm<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:29:11] &lt;Orbixx&gt; Just figured it out.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:29:14] &lt;Orbixx&gt; Thanks.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:29:53] &lt;Orbixx&gt;

nope<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:31:50] &lt;venture37&gt; that's good to hear<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:36:38] &lt;venture37&gt; has anyone done any work on creating a zenoss port for monitoring?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:36:54] &lt;venture37&gt;

Orbixx: yeh, ignore them, they are useless<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:39:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are overly sensitive and kick off all the time<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:39:47] * Orbixx nods<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:39:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have 15 production Zenoss servers running and I get hundreds of heartbeat failures per day on each one, but they run perfectly fine<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:40:09] &lt;Orbixx&gt; Apparently the creators run zenoss on quantum computers.<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:40:09] &lt;Orbixx&gt;

Is there a way to ignore them that's built-in to zenoss?<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:45:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's an event tuning system built in to Zenoss<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:45:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; you just need to learn it<br/>[01-Dec-2010 15:45:49] &lt;Orbixx&gt;

yeah cool<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:54:48] &lt;Simon4&gt; so before alerting rules get fired<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:55:24] * Simon4 can't say his job is ever boring, today I'm tcpdumping a hudson irc bot<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:55:31] &lt;kokey&gt; now just to sort out this business where he is saying the line speed is not actually the speed to the customer<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:55:48] &lt;Simon4&gt; is the speed available via snmp on the device elsewhere?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:56:35] &lt;kokey&gt; dunno, the guy who is leaving babbled some stuff<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:56:51] &lt;kokey&gt; personally i suspect that the line speed is right<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:56:59] &lt;Simon4&gt; *dontforgetthisreallyfuckingimportantthing* BYE!<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:57:21] &lt;kokey&gt; it's just that even tho it's an openview implementation he wrote the stuff that got the info off the interfaces manually<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:58:10] &lt;kokey&gt; the conversation this morning started with him wanting to know if we could so something like trigger a script to check the interfaces to set them up since the ifindex changes<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:58:54] &lt;Simon4&gt; argh<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:58:59] &lt;Simon4&gt; ifindex changing makes for pain<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:59:13] &lt;kokey&gt; well i'm sure it's picked up during modeling<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:59:16] &lt;Simon4&gt; a remodel will sort that out though<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:59:17] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah<br/>[02-Dec-2010 05:59:21] &lt;kokey&gt; and everything else after that happens by ifname since<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:00:10] &lt;kokey&gt; the issue here is that it seems like he reinvented the wheel here massively and in a convoluted way that only he can manage<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:00:33] &lt;kokey&gt; and the system spews out thousands of alerts each day that no one looks at<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:00:43] &lt;kokey&gt; lots of duplicates<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:00:57] &lt;kokey&gt; and i'm sure openview has some ability to deal with duplicates<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:01:22] &lt;kokey&gt; but i've seen a lot of his home grown plugins for openview sends out emails themselves etc.<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:01:35] &lt;Simon4&gt; oh joy<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:02:07] &lt;kokey&gt; the guy writes some nice scripts tho, and likes to learn new languages<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:02:31] &lt;kokey&gt; i think he was just left on his own too long to do this<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:23:47] &lt;kokey&gt; is there a way to trigger a mass remodel?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:25:33] &lt;Simon4&gt; zenmodeler run -p "/Device/Class/Goes/Here"<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:28:01] &lt;kokey&gt; nice one, thanks<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:28:08] &lt;kokey&gt; i owe you a lot of beer by now<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:29:11] &lt;kokey&gt; urgh so the guy who is leaving<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:29:17] &lt;kokey&gt; i'll just call him exit guy from now on<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:29:28] &lt;kokey&gt; he rolled out systemedge everywhere<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:29:41] &lt;kokey&gt; and he loves snmp traps<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:29:57] &lt;kokey&gt; and he's changed the global systemedge config to throw all the traps to my box<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:30:15] &lt;kokey&gt; i wonder how many of those traps are custom and how many are standard<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:30:22] &lt;kokey&gt; i'll load the mib and see<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:42:04] &lt;kokey&gt; mib is tiny, yeah lots of custom nonsense<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:43:07] &lt;froztbyte&gt; \o/<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:43:13] &lt;kokey&gt; can one load mibs from the command line?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:43:18] &lt;froztbyte&gt; yup<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:43:33] &lt;kokey&gt; zenmib run ./nameofmib.mib.<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:43:35] &lt;Simon4&gt;

does it always use the file in that path or does it load them and keep them in the db?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:44:30] &lt;Simon4&gt; the latter<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:44:32] &lt;froztbyte&gt; loads them into DB<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:44:43] &lt;kokey&gt; ok cool<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:44:50] &lt;froztbyte&gt; it reads the mib and compiles an in-zenoss set of information for use by the event manager<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:44:50] &lt;kokey&gt; since the sysedge mibs are on an NFS mount<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:45:48] &lt;kokey&gt; if you load the same mib twice should it behave?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:46:02] &lt;Simon4&gt; *nod*<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:46:11] &lt;Simon4&gt; it'll probably just have a whinge<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:46:18] &lt;kokey&gt; ok cool<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:48:34] &lt;froztbyte&gt; speaking of mibs, does anyone have a recommendation for compiling them? not something I've done before, but might need to do soon<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:49:40] &lt;kokey&gt; good luck<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:50:12] &lt;Simon4&gt; we've been ditching traps for using zenoss's syslogd here of late<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:50:30] &lt;Simon4&gt; it saves writing transforms for traps to make them more human readable for 24/7 type people<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:50:30] &lt;froztbyte&gt; I need a mix of traps with syslog<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:50:42] &lt;froztbyte&gt; mostly because of vendor equipment stuff<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:51:01] &lt;froztbyte&gt; speaking of, I need to do that zensyslog patch this week<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:51:06] &lt;kokey&gt; i don't like traps<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:51:12] &lt;kokey&gt; i avoid them as far as possible<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:51:20] &lt;kokey&gt; i rather poll for stuff<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:51:39] &lt;froztbyte&gt; I don't have an option otherwise<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:51:52] &lt;froztbyte&gt; I've got some devices that will literally fall over if I poll them<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:52:03] &lt;kokey&gt; i find with most things you can poll the same status as a trap goes for<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:52:05] &lt;froztbyte&gt; but their architecture allows for traps to come out<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:52:12] &lt;kokey&gt; froztbyte: haha, ok<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:52:19] &lt;froztbyte&gt; and they don't syslog<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:52:52] &lt;froztbyte&gt; half, at most, of the devices I ever need to care about is a *nix-like system that I can have it do my bidding<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:53:12] &lt;froztbyte&gt; the other chunk are embedded devices that I can't tweak really far<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:53:18] &lt;kokey&gt; even APC gear is not too crap at polling<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:53:30] &lt;froztbyte&gt; and that's where most of my work on zenoss has gone to so far<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:53:39] &lt;froztbyte&gt; kokey: yeah, APC are pretty damn SNMP friendly<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:54:04] &lt;kokey&gt; HP PDUs and the likes too<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:54:17] &lt;Simon4&gt; the problem with polling something like an APC ATS is that in 5 minutes you could have a power event where it flicks over then back, and you'll miss it<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:54:24] &lt;froztbyte&gt; mmmmm, I haven't had any of those to deal with yet<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:54:27] &lt;kokey&gt; only monitored Denco aircons before, but they're fine to scrape a web page instead of doing traps<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:54:34] &lt;Simon4&gt; as much as it might not impact service, knowing about it helps to point the finger at colo providers <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:54:42] &lt;froztbyte&gt; but given HPs touting of SIM and such, I imagine their whole stack is pretty nice<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:55:10] &lt;kokey&gt; we had over 1000 HP DL360 servers at my last gig<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:55:21] &lt;kokey&gt; and i monitored them over snmp using the HP agents<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:55:40] &lt;kokey&gt; hpasm but now has some new names<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:55:54] &lt;kokey&gt; little plugins written in C to poll them over snmp<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:56:13] &lt;kokey&gt; worked fine even with nagios spawning children to run these plugins<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:57:05] &lt;froztbyte&gt; the latest incarnation with iLO3 is called Insight Manager, iirc<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:57:11] &lt;froztbyte&gt; it looks pretty damn hot<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:57:24] &lt;froztbyte&gt; I haven't had a chance to roll it out completely in my env, no VM space previously<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:57:37] &lt;froztbyte&gt; but with the KVM tests we're doing now, I might have a shot at playing with it<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:58:19] &lt;kokey&gt; can an ilo3 interface also be used as a normal interface?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:58:28] &lt;kokey&gt; i vaguely remember that being possible from ilo2<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:58:35] &lt;froztbyte&gt; how do you mean?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:58:53] &lt;froztbyte&gt; ilo3 used in a browser, standalone per box?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:58:58] &lt;kokey&gt; in older ilo you can only get to the ilo stuff on that interface<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:59:10] &lt;kokey&gt; but with newer ilo you can also have it be a nic to the OS<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:59:15] &lt;RuslanPopov&gt; re<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:59:19] &lt;froztbyte&gt; kokey: ooooh<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:59:35] &lt;kokey&gt; in other words you can use it as a management interface to ssh into the OS or get to the snmpd on the OS too<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:59:43] &lt;RuslanPopov&gt; ppl, how to show SNMP's dskPercent as a graph on zenoss page?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:59:45] &lt;kokey&gt; kind of like how it works on sun servers<br/>[02-Dec-2010 06:59:47] &lt;froztbyte&gt; yes, one of the later ilo2 editions already solved that issue on the shared ports<br/>[02-Dec-2010 07:00:15] &lt;froztbyte&gt; so the interface doubles up as ilo and a NIC, different MACs presented on one physical interface<br/>[02-Dec-2010 07:00:23] &lt;froztbyte&gt; think that was around the g5's<br/>[02-Dec-2010 07:00:32] &lt;Simon4&gt; kokey: you can?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 07:00:42] &lt;froztbyte&gt; RuslanPopov: edit the performance template<br/>[02-Dec-2010 07:00:47] &lt;kokey&gt; we just had dl360 g3, g4 and g4p<br/>[02-Dec-2010 07:01:05] &lt;froztbyte&gt; we've got a few g5's, and then now rolling out g7's everywhere<br/>[02-Dec-2010 07:01:11] &lt;kokey&gt; Simon4: yeah it's handy on 1U boxes where you have say two NICs for redundancy and use the ilo then for management<br/>[02-Dec-2010 07:01:15] &lt;froztbyte&gt;

also, since it's timing out, that tells me it's just taking a long time...<br/>[02-Dec-2010 14:43:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you snmpwalk the device, does it go slowly?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 14:43:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe it has a large routing table or something?<br/>[02-Dec-2010 14:43:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; in any case, try increasing the zCollectorClientTimeout value to 3000<br/>[02-Dec-2010 14:43:58] &lt;rmatte&gt;

it's fantastic<br/>[03-Dec-2010 06:31:32] &lt;kokey&gt; yeah for sure i'll want to get into all the nice stuff one can do with event transforms<br/>[03-Dec-2010 06:32:04] &lt;kokey&gt; however i want to try stick to the stock features as far as possible since i suspect it might get too easy to reinvent the wheel by accident with transforms<br/>[03-Dec-2010 06:34:04] &lt;froztbyte&gt; indeed<br/>[03-Dec-2010 06:34:13] &lt;froztbyte&gt; I'm very guilty of that in some places<br/>[03-Dec-2010 06:36:40] &lt;kokey&gt; i've noticed<br/>[03-Dec-2010 06:36:41] &lt;kokey&gt; hehe<br/>[03-Dec-2010 06:36:48] &lt;froztbyte&gt;

the HQ is in Annapolis, MD, but most of the company is in Austin, TX<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:21:22] &lt;cgibbons&gt; I live in a suburb of Houston, TX, so I do a lot of 6-hour commuting every other week<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:21:33] &lt;cgibbons&gt;

We wanted to integrate the R Analytics system into the reporting system (it's designed to do it) but it turns out you can do the simple statistical regressions within the charting package.<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:36:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: so Zenoss are moving away from remote people I guess?<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:36:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice, yeh it looks good<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:37:26] &lt;cgibbons&gt; not especially, but just as the team as grown mostly in Austin the # of remote people is pretty small now. It's myself, Kells somewhere in the great white north, Eric Edgar in MN, and then probably just sales people<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:37:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; once you guys have those reports done it'll be easy to build a solarwinds style portal page<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:37:37] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yeah<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:37:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; so are you actually leaving Zenoss or just taking a break and coming back?<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:38:32] &lt;cgibbons&gt; The reporting feature is some Zenoss modifications (ZenPacks, 'core' changes) and then a new server component (intended to be on a separate system) that is running tomcat, mysql, jasperserver, and some of our code.<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:38:33] &lt;cgibbons&gt; leaving<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:38:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:39:15] &lt;cgibbons&gt; JS also includes a wonderful ad-hoc reporting system that's all drag-and-drop and easy for end-users to do crosstabs and whatever without having to know SQL.<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:39:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:40:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think the new reports are going to push Zenoss' value up significantly<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:40:37] &lt;cgibbons&gt; indeed<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:40:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; now if only they can get the template editing in the new UI sorted out, it'll be one heck of a product <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:41:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the only thing that's been holding me back from upgrading<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:41:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; speaking of which, today shall be the day that I write up a list of issues with the template editing<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:42:24] &lt;cgibbons&gt; one thing I didn't get finished in that report is solving the missing data issue. the sinusoidal pattern in the historical line in the middle chart is artificial, as we don't have data for every hour in that time range.<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:44:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; ohhh<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:44:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I thought it looked a bit too neat<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:44:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:45:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm sure they'll figure it out<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:49:00] &lt;cgibbons&gt; RRD handles that with its consolidation function feature<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:50:00] &lt;kokey&gt; there going to be mouse selectable multi graph stuff?<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:51:21] &lt;mray&gt; interesting, Amazon Cloudwatch monitoring is now free<br/>[03-Dec-2010 10:53:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; smart on their part, gives them a leg up on the competition<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:07:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: hmm, in that screenshot, the data in the Input, Output, and Total columns is presented a bit weird<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:07:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; .02839GB instead of whatever that is in MB<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:08:00] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yeah well, details<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:08:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:09:03] &lt;cgibbons&gt; one of the things i wanted to finish for that, but didn't get a chance to do so, is the auto-scaling of those values into G, M, K, or whatever. it's too grungy right now.<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:09:18] * rmatte nods<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:09:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; was the actual graph generation coded from scratch or did you use something pre-built for that?<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:20:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; the layering is jasperserver -&gt; jasperreports -&gt; jfreecharts (or fusion charts, which is flash based)<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:20:50] &lt;cgibbons&gt; so that's using a graph customizer that in turn uses the jfreechart API to do some simple customizations<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:21:24] &lt;cgibbons&gt; the trending is added dynamically as a dataset based upon the data coming from the database, and the rendering types is changed (limited options in the jasperreport UI to configure the type of rendering)<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:21:46] &lt;cgibbons&gt; typically what you'd do is build a chart customizer like that, and make it into a chart theme that can then be applied to charts as you build reports... imagine a network-utilization chart theme, for example.<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:22:13] &lt;willwh&gt;

I used that in 2.5.* to hit sites and look for a regex (a guid)<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:23:46] &lt;willwh&gt; anyway - I have a local template for the device in question - but I don't see how I can access the http ip service params for that device only<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:25:22] &lt;willwh&gt;

nope - mine all seem to be working nicely<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:28:29] &lt;willwh&gt; (I just migrated from 2.5* -&gt; 3.*)<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:29:21] &lt;willwh&gt; I did have a similar graph in my 2.5* deploy - it always worked nicely<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:29:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, they work fine on my other Zenoss installs<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:29:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; this issue just popped up today on one of them<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:29:46] &lt;willwh&gt; huh<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:29:52] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

and i'm rather sensitive to caffiene<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:51:28] &lt;kokey&gt; so this is going to be fun<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:51:32] &lt;kokey&gt; starbucks<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:51:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; aha, that failed generating graph from plugin test message is related to the aggregate graph<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:51:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; now I just need to figure out what "test" is<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:52:16] &lt;kokey&gt; heh<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:52:26] &lt;kokey&gt; so we've hadded some routers to zenoss<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:52:37] &lt;kokey&gt; and the networking guy noticed that i can see like 339 routes on it<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:52:51] &lt;kokey&gt; and he realised that's not right since the customer routers aren't supposed to get all the routes, only a couple<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:53:03] &lt;kokey&gt; so he fixed it, but seems like it's now lost the route back to my zenoss server<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:53:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:54:47] &lt;kokey&gt; that's what happens when you 'fix' things on a friday afternoon<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:55:21] &lt;kokey&gt; ok half way through that latte now and i'm _wired_<br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:55:34] &lt;willwh&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[03-Dec-2010 11:55:52] &lt;kokey&gt;

durrr<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:38:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; this aggregate graph issue is such a pain<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:42:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's a spot to specify devices for this aggregate report, but it doesn't work<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:45:53] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; wow @ incompetent technical support folks... it would help if they knew how their own products worked.<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:48:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:48:57] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; brocade<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:49:33] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i clearly explained a situation that isnt working as expected, provided configs, and somehow they screwed it all up.<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:49:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:49:52] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; simple things like you can't name an ACL one thing, and then try to apply it using a different name.<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:50:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; was the tech support rep someone with an indian accent who introduced themselves as "Paul"?<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:50:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; because if so, that should have been your first clue<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:50:17] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; these guys use their real foreign names<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:50:25] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so theres no guessing<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:50:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:50:36] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; usually they're pretty good, but this is a bit disturbing<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:50:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should contact someone at brocade and complain<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:50:56] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; also, if you're trying to test an outbound ACL, you can't just configure another interface on the same router and loop the ports together<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:51:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its just going to ping internally<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:51:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:51:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's just common sense<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:51:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; thats more or less what they are doing and saying "oh, it works!"<br/>[03-Dec-2010 12:51:31] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Is this something that Zenoss provides the ability to do already?<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:42:33] &lt;Parabola&gt; zenoss is agentless<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:43:25] &lt;Simon4&gt; voxter1: your agents could a) raise snmp traps to zenoss, or b) fire a piece of json at the zenoss server to raise events that zenoss would then aggregate / tag to the relevant device<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:43:39] &lt;Simon4&gt; but as Parabola said, zenoss doesn't have agents by default, you would need to provide that bit<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:44:59] &lt;voxter1&gt; Well, im looking to correlate arbitrary data. in my case, registration and state data about SIP phones - so I would have to write my own data collector for sure. I'm curious however if the construct exists in zenoss to use it as an arbitrary data aggregator/grapher, if i am able to write my own collector to collect the necessary data, and potentially some sort of reporting agent that would push it back to zenoss core<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:45:22] &lt;voxter1&gt; If i were to write my own event engine id have to do that on my own anyways, but if the server side piece is in place already, thats one less thing to write.<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:46:25] &lt;Simon4&gt; so the event aggregation is definitely there, and you can very easily get zenoss to run a command on a remote server (via ssh or similar) to fetch arbitary performance metrics and then provide an interface to graph them<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:46:59] &lt;voxter1&gt; Simon4:&#160; ok. I'm specifically interested in pushing data TO a correlator, rather than making zenoss request it<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:47:14] &lt;voxter1&gt; Simon4:&#160; but im sure thats just a small detail.<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:48:03] &lt;voxter1&gt; Simon4:&#160; I guess what I need to know is, can i create a device or node of some type in zenoss, and build arbitrary data value types that i can populate. for instance, can i build a device type I call 'clientXYZ' and then push arbitrary data like 'phone 100' status: online<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:48:26] &lt;voxter1&gt; and update/track each item as a known entity in zenoss on my own?<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:49:31] &lt;voxter1&gt; I realize i may be asking a confusing question, ive just got a bunch of data that may simply be an event that i want to do something with and i either need to write an event bus system on my own that sits beside zenoss, or incorporate the two, and im looking for what you might consider a "best practice debate" answer on wether i should be considering zenoss for the job, or just step aside it.<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:49:50] &lt;Simon4&gt; so there's a couple of ways to so online/offline status.. one way is to just have your "agent" raise a "clear" event when it sees the phone online, and an "error" event when it's not<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:50:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; that'll get zenoss to at least alert when phones go down, and tell you when they come back etc<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:50:16] &lt;Simon4&gt; so very simple to leverage the event system<br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:50:56] &lt;Simon4&gt; you can then get far more complex, and define custom "device" types in zenoss via zenpacks, so custom components, dynamically modelled types etc but that's a far deeper rabbit hole that requires some python knowledge and a bunch of time and effort <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[04-Dec-2010 13:51:23] &lt;voxter1&gt; Sure.

thats because it see that line and doesn't like it<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:03:10] &lt;ericenns&gt; it only parses one line of output and with that you get two lines<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:03:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; so how do I fix that?<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:03:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; there must be some way to quiet it down<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:03:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:04:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; even if I redirect the error output to /dev/null it's still failing to give any output when I run the command from the commandline by hand<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:04:26] &lt;ericenns&gt; in vmware.py in the parsers<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:05:09] &lt;ericenns&gt; just eat all the lines until you see an |<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:05:32] &lt;ericenns&gt; or wait<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:05:44] &lt;ericenns&gt; yup before line 19<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:06:21] &lt;ericenns&gt; actually maybe more that but I am assuming output is only 1 line<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:06:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just don't get why I'm getting zero output from the script<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:06:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; like, not even on a second line<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:06:53] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh yeah<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:07:03] &lt;ericenns&gt; not sure about that<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:07:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; I notice you have --options 'hostperf:blah'<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:07:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; does blah have to be the hostname?<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:07:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; or can it be the ip?<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:10:16] &lt;ericenns&gt; it has rto be the hostname<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:10:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:11:11] &lt;ericenns&gt; it how the data is stored in vsphere<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:11:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I just tried it with the hostname that's set on there, still no data<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:11:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; aha<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:12:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; I had to add the domain name to it<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:12:16] &lt;ericenns&gt; cool I just made a script to show an AUP at login in gnome and if you don't accept it, reboot<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:12:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's probably why nothing is working<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:12:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; didn't realize that<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:12:30] &lt;ericenns&gt; yes it needs fqdn<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:12:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:12:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; do you have that in the instructions on the ZenPack page?<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:13:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; if not, you should add it<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:13:26] &lt;rmatte&gt;

do you have time to fix that error message thing?<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:15:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; so that it ignores until it sees a |<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:15:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:16:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, I have a good temporary solution for now...<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:16:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; just added 2&gt;/dev/null to the end of the command strings<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:17:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; that'll do for now<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:18:10] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh yeah thats true<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:18:27] &lt;ericenns&gt; I will work on that error message thing tonight<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:18:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:18:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; hopefully I can get this working<br/>[06-Dec-2010 13:19:41] &lt;ericenns&gt;

^^<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:45:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:46:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; heh<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:46:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; ablew: Zenoss treats all events the same, it doesn't distinguish between syslogs and other events<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:46:33] &lt;ablew&gt; rmatte: ahh...<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:46:41] &lt;ablew&gt; rmatte: does it have any event lifecycle type facility?<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:47:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; It has a feature to automatically delete events after a certain period of time, but it applies to all events<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:47:29] &lt;ablew&gt; gotcha<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:47:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; there are plenty of ways to do what you want, but it all involves some coding<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:47:44] &lt;ablew&gt; gotcha.<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:47:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the easiest way would be to setup syslog-ng between the outside and Zenoss<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:48:00] &lt;ablew&gt; does it store all the events in mysql?<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:48:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; have Zenoss' syslog server on a different port<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:48:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; have syslog-ng dump the syslogs to disk<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:48:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; then forward them on to Zenoss for alerting<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:48:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; and logrotate them<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:48:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; and yes, all events are in MySQL<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:48:56] &lt;ablew&gt; yea, i'm thinking i'll just forward warn and up to zenoss directly and then everything on to the central log store in another syslog.conf entry<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:49:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what I do for some of my clients<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:49:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; works fine<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:49:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to compile syslog-ng with spoofing<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:49:43] &lt;ablew&gt; i'm actually liking rsyslog more these days<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:50:13] &lt;ablew&gt; you can have it watch normal files and forward them on, newer versions have support for the hadoop distributed filesystem<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:51:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've worked with rsyslog too, I find syslog-ng is higher performance<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:54:31] &lt;ablew&gt; what kind of volume were you throwing at rsyslog before you ran into issues?<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:55:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; can't remember<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:55:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; either way, if you're not having performance issues with it then it doesn't matter<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:56:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I just brought up my 16th production Zenoss box<br/>[06-Dec-2010 15:57:24] &lt;ablew&gt;

ah, did you install the stack?<br/>[06-Dec-2010 19:48:35] &lt;rhettardo&gt; the stack installer uses port 3007 by default i believe<br/>[06-Dec-2010 19:49:50] &lt;wobblyonions&gt; ah right that would be the case then, mmm interesting ok any idea how to get into that DB then at all, i.e whats the password by default etc<br/>[06-Dec-2010 19:50:20] &lt;wobblyonions&gt;

interesting<br/>[07-Dec-2010 07:53:34] &lt;kokey&gt; lemme try that<br/>[07-Dec-2010 07:54:14] &lt;kokey&gt; if '1.3.6.1.4.1.546.' in evt.message:<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:04:33] &lt;kokey&gt; this event stuff turns me on<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:04:38] &lt;kokey&gt;

I guess I should create some more<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:32:36] &lt;kokey&gt; e.g. we don't really care about load on our dev servers<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:33:09] &lt;kokey&gt; what's the best way to do that... create a template e.g. /Server/Linux/Dev and a group for Dev and then put those servers in that group?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:42:08] &lt;jmp242&gt; kokey: I think you may want variable thresholds for that? Or in ,,,/dev you could just remove the default template<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:42:40] &lt;jmp242&gt; Variable Thresholds: docs/DOC-4724#Another_method_for_Per_Device_Filesystem_thresholds<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:43:58] &lt;Simon4&gt; kokey: yeah<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:44:14] &lt;Simon4&gt; basically put the dev servers into their own class then override the "Device" template in that class and remove the thresholds<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:45:34] &lt;kokey&gt; i think for now it will just be a case of very high thresholds for dev servers, and something blanket/default for the rest<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:46:40] &lt;kokey&gt; a loadavg of 30 will do<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:46:46] &lt;kokey&gt; looks like default is 13<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:47:08] &lt;kokey&gt; boss said today i should get a quote for enterprise but it looks like they will buy it<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:47:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, the 2431 above is actually 24<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:47:31] * Simon4 keeps meaning to write a quick event transform to fix that message here<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:54:05] &lt;jmp242&gt; kokey: either way, you can always come to IRC and the forums for help<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:55:17] &lt;kokey&gt; hmmmm, can't figure out how to override a template for a class<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:55:22] &lt;kokey&gt; just per device<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:55:40] &lt;kokey&gt; jmp242: yeah i have, the help here has been brilliant<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:56:18] &lt;kokey&gt; buying enterprise is more for stuff like the deeper access control, some of the cisco, checkpoint, netapp and vmware stuff, etc.<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:58:09] &lt;csabo&gt; good morning<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:58:40] &lt;jmp242&gt; kokey: to do that, you need to click on either Details -&gt; or the gear in the left hand pane<br/>[07-Dec-2010 08:58:55] &lt;jmp242&gt; I don't recall exactly, but it's not as obvious in v3 compared to v2<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:00:45] &lt;csabo&gt; what are you looking for?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:00:54] &lt;csabo&gt; i've been using 3 exclusivly since release date<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:00:57] &lt;jmp242&gt; Actually, I take that back<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:01:11] &lt;jmp242&gt; how do you see the templates at the Device Class level<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:01:38] &lt;csabo&gt; let me look<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:01:53] &lt;kokey&gt; it actually lists the monitoring templates<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:01:54] &lt;csabo&gt;

Oh, it was just Opera vs Firefox I think<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:02:19] &lt;kokey&gt; but for devices you have an option to create a local template<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:02:21] &lt;jmp242&gt; I usually scrape by with Opera<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:02:29] &lt;kokey&gt; at class level you only have bind templates option<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:02:31] &lt;jmp242&gt; I think they call it Override Template now<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:02:45] &lt;jmp242&gt; that will make a copy of the template<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:02:52] * Simon4 has a look<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:03:04] &lt;kokey&gt; yeah i can do that per device<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:03:10] &lt;Simon4&gt; I'm sure I found this<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:03:40] &lt;jmp242&gt; I've been using Zenoss since 1.01 and still am fumbling with 3.x interface<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:04:27] &lt;Simon4&gt; ah, got it<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:04:31] &lt;Simon4&gt; what a f**king palava<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:04:45] &lt;Simon4&gt; kokey: listen very carefully, I vill say zis only once<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:04:48] &lt;kokey&gt; i guess you have to create a template elsewhere<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:04:52] &lt;kokey&gt; and then bind it<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:04:55] &lt;Simon4&gt; go to Advanced<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:05:03] &lt;Simon4&gt; then click on "Monitoring Templates"<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:05:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; wait for list of templates to load<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:05:27] &lt;Simon4&gt; click on the name of the template you care about, and it should expand to show you the places that that template is "overridden"<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:05:53] &lt;Simon4&gt; click on the one you want to override, click the gear menu, select "override template"<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:06:15] &lt;Simon4&gt; pick where you want to place your "overridden template" (i.e. the dev class where you want to make changes to it)<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:06:19] &lt;Simon4&gt; hit okay<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:06:22] &lt;Simon4&gt; ... profit!<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:06:23] &lt;jmp242&gt; That is quite convoluted - I hope they remember to fix this in later versions<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:06:31] &lt;jmp242&gt; Simon4: can I add that to the ForumFAQ part 2?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:06:31] &lt;kokey&gt; cool<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:06:31] * Simon4 dies a little inside<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:06:45] &lt;Simon4&gt; jmp242: heh, go for it <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:06:56] &lt;kokey&gt; yeah it was actually reasonable intuitive once i found the monitoring templates thing under advanced<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:07:28] &lt;jmp242&gt; lol<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:07:37] &lt;jmp242&gt; nevermind, I should check my own faq occasionally<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:07:38] &lt;jmp242&gt; docs/DOC-4724#HowdoIcopytemplatesinZenoss3<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:07:42] &lt;Simon4&gt; heh<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:07:59] &lt;jmp242&gt; I thought that was something I had figured out before - I remembered the gear icon<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:08:05] &lt;kokey&gt; hehe<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:08:06] &lt;kokey&gt; oh<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:08:17] &lt;jmp242&gt; but why it didn't give the option when looking at the Infrastructure tab I'll never know<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:08:26] &lt;Simon4&gt; changing the "group by" to device class vs template it's a bit more intuative also<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:08:38] &lt;kokey&gt; another snag, once you've created the new template you have to make sure you select it first before editing it or else you modify the original<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:08:50] &lt;Simon4&gt; heh<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:10:09] &lt;jmp242&gt; I've found it's always a good idea to check a few times what Zenoss thinks you're editing vs what you think you're doing<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:11:41] &lt;kokey&gt; hehe<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:11:42] &lt;kokey&gt; yeah<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:33:27] &lt;csabo&gt; lmao, IBMs webchat support is called "IBMs Virtual Innovation Center"<br/>[07-Dec-2010 09:33:48] &lt;csabo&gt;

lol<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:31:16] &lt;csabo&gt; you can actually just type a command in like you would to a runbox, or a cmd prompt, they have a "system command" option which is pretty neat<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:31:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:31:42] &lt;csabo&gt; yeah, getting it to run one in response to an event, is another story, working on that now <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:31:45] &lt;csabo&gt;

the situation editor, is epic<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:33:34] &lt;csabo&gt; the condition selection is huge, every possible thing you can think of in windows or on a pc, can be added<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:34:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:34:33] &lt;csabo&gt; yeah, this is actually very neat<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:34:44] &lt;csabo&gt; i shall screenshot<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:37:56] &lt;csabo&gt; rmatte: http://imgur.com/q2Ufc.jpg<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:38:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:43:32] &lt;csabo&gt; wow you can even fill in a field called "Expert advice"<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:43:44] &lt;csabo&gt; so if you want errors sent to helpdeks, you can provide step by step fix instructions with it<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:45:01] &lt;csabo&gt; looks they even provide some<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:45:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:45:43] &lt;csabo&gt; that would be helpful if you can dedicate the time to providing that information<br/>[07-Dec-2010 11:46:00] &lt;csabo&gt; i suppose you could do that in zenoss, with seperate emails<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:01:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:01:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; or with transforms<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:01:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; just have it added to the event message<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:02:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've done that for a couple events<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:16:40] &lt;kokey&gt; i wonder if i hit a bug in zenoss 3.0.3<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:17:05] &lt;kokey&gt; seems like the event detail link sent over email gets a json error if the user's browser is not logged in already<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:17:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; could be<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:18:28] &lt;kokey&gt; it's either like that or becomes like that if i change the hostname of the server<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:21:04] &lt;forsberg&gt; sorry to interrupt, sup rmatte, did you and eric figure out something last night ?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:21:37] &lt;kokey&gt; yeah it looks like it's only an issue with viewDetail?evid=whatever when it's not logged in<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:31:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; forsberg: not as far as I'm aware<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:31:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; forsberg: he was going to look at it last night, I can't since my monitor at home is busted<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:31:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm too busy to look at it today but I do definitely want to fix it, so I'll get back to it soon enough<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:34:17] &lt;forsberg&gt; yeah yeah, super, just had to ask <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/> I really appreciate it hehe, all my private shit is on an esxi now and also very interesting for work to be able to use it properly <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:34:28] &lt;rmatte&gt;

delete from history where device like "SPAMMASTER";<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:40:53] &lt;forsberg&gt; ^^<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:45:40] &lt;sytem&gt; i add "limit 200000" to delete-queries and run them while there is something to remove<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:46:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; meh<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:46:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not a super SQL guy, I just know enough<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:47:43] &lt;sytem&gt; me either<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:48:22] &lt;sytem&gt; just have found out that queries trying to remove to much will fail, and cause rollback<br/>[07-Dec-2010 12:48:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:37:03] &lt;jmp242&gt; rmatte: do you happen to know if I wanted to change the Zenoss user MySQL password - where would I do it so it could still save events?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:37:10] &lt;jmp242&gt; in 3.x<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:43:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; jmp242: Events -&gt; Event Manager<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:43:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; same as in 2.5<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:43:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd have to change the password in mysql as well though<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:43:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's just the place to tell Zenoss what the password is, not to actually change it<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:43:20] &lt;jmp242&gt; right - and silly me<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:43:29] &lt;jmp242&gt; I thought it'd be in Advanced -&gt; something<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:43:30] &lt;jmp242&gt; lol<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:43:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:43:58] &lt;jmp242&gt; If anyone from Zenoss reads these things, they really ought to put Event Manager in the config screens<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:44:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it relates to events<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:44:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; hence the events screen<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:44:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:46:13] &lt;forsberg&gt; :9<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:54:22] &lt;jmp242&gt; Well, the predictive threshold installed in 3.0.2 anyway - let me select it as a threshold type, but I can't figure out how to get in to the settings like the screen shots show. I'm guessing this has to do with what we talked about yesterday on here for the gui definitions or changed file names or something<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:54:25] &lt;jmp242&gt; any ideas?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:58:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; for new ZenPacks, they need to have a interfaces.py, info.py, and configure.zcml file in them to display new interface components<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:58:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; whereas the old ones just needed a skin file<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:58:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you need both to make it cross-compatible<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:58:43] &lt;jmp242&gt; So like docs/DOC-10073#d0e8189<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:58:50] &lt;jmp242&gt; what they say in their zenpack conversion page<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:58:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if no interfaces, info, or configure files have been authored for it, and it has UI components, it's guaranteed not to work<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:59:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[07-Dec-2010 13:59:43] &lt;jmp242&gt; Great.<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:25:33] &lt;jmp242&gt; well, don't know how to make predictive thresholds work, but did get upgraded to 3.0.3 !<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:25:36] &lt;jmp242&gt; yay<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:29:27] &lt;rmatte&gt;

cool<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:52:02] &lt;nyeates&gt; 3 ppl were super interested, 2 walked out, and the rest of the 15 were mildly interested<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:52:14] &lt;jmp242&gt; I'm amazed more people aren't interested<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:52:25] &lt;nyeates&gt; the 2 that walked out grilled me on why do we use zope and mysql...apparently they think that these are components of the past<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:52:51] &lt;jmp242&gt; Though when I gave a presentation on our Assets server running OSS (OCSNG, GLPI, Zenoss) at HEPIX and thought people would be interested in zenoss and biased the presentation on that<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:53:08] &lt;jmp242&gt; the only questions were about OCSNG lol<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:53:13] &lt;csabo&gt; ocsng<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:53:14] &lt;csabo&gt; ?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:53:15] &lt;jmp242&gt; which I just touched on<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:53:31] &lt;jmp242&gt; http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:53:40] &lt;nyeates&gt; yeah its hard to present not know what your audience wants<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:54:07] &lt;jmp242&gt; The zope and mysql people<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:54:17] &lt;jmp242&gt; what did they think were the stuff of the future then<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:54:18] &lt;jmp242&gt; ??<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:54:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; nyeates: your answer for next time is that nothing else was around when the project was started <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:54:24] &lt;jmp242&gt;

hahaha rmatte....likely that is the *real* answer....but really we make it scale pretty big<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:55:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; Plone didn't exist when Zenoss was created<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:55:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; I personally like Zope<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:55:18] &lt;jmp242&gt; csabo - is that to me re OCSNG?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:55:23] &lt;nyeates&gt; i guess they were maybe refering to like ruby on rales and nosql stuff<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:55:26] &lt;csabo&gt; jmp242:&#160; yup<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:55:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:55:35] &lt;jmp242&gt; if so, it's just an agent install and a server install<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:55:49] &lt;jmp242&gt; run the server on Linux and the appropriate agent(s) and it's pretty easy<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:56:13] &lt;jmp242&gt; The problem is like Zenoss Core there's no ACLs to speak of<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:56:19] &lt;nyeates&gt; they were asking like why is zenoss so hard and it goes overboard....i think they are probly trying to run a small shop and were frustrated by the power (and learning curve) zenoss wields<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:56:24] &lt;csabo&gt; ah<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:56:52] &lt;csabo&gt; its FUGLY<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:56:56] &lt;jmp242&gt; but add GLPI for the user interface (lol) and it has full ACL and lots of stuff - it just imports the data from OCSNG<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:56:56] &lt;jmp242&gt; there's also Fusion Inventory<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:57:05] &lt;jmp242&gt; that may skip OCSNG entirely later on<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:57:08] &lt;nyeates&gt; i told rusty, those guys can go use whats up gold<br/>[07-Dec-2010 14:57:19] &lt;csabo&gt;

why? it's sooo easy and maintenance free<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:26:23] &lt;csabo&gt; let me rephrase, if you use the webgui in current freenas versions then stop<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:26:39] &lt;jmp242&gt; ummm, I set it up with that, but don't otherwise use it?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:26:40] &lt;csabo&gt; i spoke to the guy who wrote the zfs portion of the webgui, he did it in a night, hasnt touched it sense<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:26:42] &lt;jmp242&gt; it just works<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:26:44] &lt;csabo&gt; jmp242:&#160; then you're fine<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:26:56] &lt;csabo&gt; jmp242:&#160; i was making changes from webgui, and it ruined my pool<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:27:12] &lt;jmp242&gt; ahh - well there's supposed to be an update when v8 comes out I think<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:27:13] &lt;nyeates&gt; what is raidz1 and 2<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:27:14] &lt;csabo&gt; jmp242:&#160; if you use freenas, until 8 is stable, use zfs and zpool from ssh<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:27:21] &lt;csabo&gt;

jmp242:&#160; 8 is a 100% rewrite, no more monowall interface<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:27:50] &lt;jmp242&gt; It better support an upgrade is all I can say<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:27:54] &lt;jmp242&gt; or I'll be very sad<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:27:58] &lt;csabo&gt; jmp242: based on FBSD 8.1 release<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:28:13] &lt;csabo&gt; going from version like 8 of ZFS to im goin to guess at least 15 or 16<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:28:27] &lt;csabo&gt; jmp242:&#160; even if you cant upgrade you can wipe the OS and just import your zfs pool, then upgrade it<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:28:32] &lt;csabo&gt; infact, i'd recommend you dont upgrade<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:28:33] &lt;nyeates&gt; i took all this time to learn mdadm and setup a nice raid5 at home....all to realize that i dont care about losing a drive....i need offsite backup....i care about losing the server, or deleting the wrong file<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:28:34] &lt;jmp242&gt;

jmp242:&#160; theres a new project that is going to keep making osol, but its not offically sposnored<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:29:42] &lt;csabo&gt; i forget its name<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:29:49] &lt;jmp242&gt; but you can use snapshots in ZFS or whatever to protect against deletions<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:30:16] &lt;csabo&gt; does the version of zfs on freenas 7 even support the snapshotting/<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:30:19] &lt;nyeates&gt; i gave up ever trying ZFS when apple decided not to use it<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:30:39] &lt;csabo&gt; nyeates:&#160; if you dont care about your data, then theres no need to use it<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:31:02] &lt;csabo&gt; its only benefit is its handling of data writing and cache, and being a transactional FS you are pretty much bullet proof<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:31:15] &lt;nyeates&gt; yes call me a fan boy....but i viewed it more as....if apple doesnt way this OSS, is that a good sign for it long term?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:31:18] &lt;csabo&gt; i suppose the dynamic stripe is a bonus, if you dont use over 80% of your space<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:31:48] &lt;csabo&gt; nyeates: i cannot make a comment on that, apple isnt perfect, they just make good hardware<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:31:53] &lt;jmp242&gt; csabo: what happens if you go over 80%<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:32:05] &lt;csabo&gt; jmp242:&#160; performance decrease, gets pretty bad :-\<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:32:09] &lt;jmp242&gt; Ahh<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:32:15] &lt;csabo&gt; jmp242:&#160; due to the dynamic striping it uses<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:32:27] &lt;csabo&gt; i think it was 80% i'll have to double check<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:32:29] &lt;jmp242&gt; I guess I'll want to upgrade to 2TB disks sooner than I thought then, or just delete files sooner, but that's quite a hit<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:32:35] &lt;jmp242&gt; on useable space then<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:32:47] &lt;csabo&gt; well remember, you cannot upgrade a raidz&lt;X&gt;<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:32:55] &lt;csabo&gt; you can create another array and add to your pool<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:33:30] &lt;jmp242&gt; mmmm - can't just replace disks one at a time and rebuild the array?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:33:51] &lt;csabo&gt; ah, that i dont know<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:33:57] &lt;csabo&gt; i thought you ment adding more disks <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:34:01] &lt;csabo&gt; lemme look real quick<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:34:21] &lt;jmp242&gt; afk for a little while<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:34:31] &lt;csabo&gt; yes you can<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:34:44] &lt;csabo&gt; or so im reading<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:35:10] &lt;nyeates&gt; csabo: i didnt understand what u wrote. so u are saying ZFS is mostly useful for good data handling - like it will perform better and not get corrupt<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:35:37] &lt;csabo&gt; nyeates: correct, performance is better until you hit high capactiy, then perf goes down<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:35:52] &lt;csabo&gt; nyeates:&#160; however its bascially bulletproof to data loss<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:36:00] &lt;csabo&gt; except for actual drive failures (multiple at once)<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:36:14] &lt;csabo&gt; i've tested, pulled drives while datas writing, it handles it like a champ<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:36:40] &lt;nyeates&gt; does it ease management? like in this situation where he wants to easily upgrade his array and usable space, and maintain the same properties of the array<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:36:40] &lt;csabo&gt; nyeates:&#160; zfs uses 256bit checksums, end to end<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:37:11] &lt;csabo&gt; management is pretty good yeah, he can issue a replace command one disk at a time<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:37:38] &lt;csabo&gt; it would be 100x better if you could add additional drives to an array, but you cannot. you can add multiple sets/arrays to a single pool<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:37:57] &lt;nyeates&gt; which changes the properties of the data security yes?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:38:13] &lt;csabo&gt; what do you mena?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:38:14] &lt;csabo&gt; mean**<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:38:47] &lt;nyeates&gt; like now uv got multiple arrays instead of one...so maybe u can lose less drives b4 u have to worry<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:38:55] &lt;nyeates&gt; hmm, sorry hard for me to explain<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:39:06] &lt;dec3pti01&gt; hmm ok I set the threshold to 1 (just to test) which I assume is milisecons and I got an alert for offset -141 secs but that is so much higher than what ntpq reports for this box being alerted<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:39:29] &lt;csabo&gt; oh i see what you're asking nyeates no, if you are say in my shoes, with raizd1 (raid5) additional arrays in the pool wont secure that data anymore<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:39:50] &lt;csabo&gt; nyeates:&#160; however, zfs does have disk cloning, and snapshots, so you could setup a 2nd raidz1 to snapshot your original to, yes<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:39:56] &lt;nyeates&gt; dec3pti01: get us a screenshot of your template setup<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:40:50] &lt;nyeates&gt; csabo: huh, ok<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:41:54] &lt;csabo&gt; very good filesystem, downsides include limited OS support (although still actively developed) it doesnt like a controller card managing the cache.. so if you use a controller, do it JBOD style<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:42:25] &lt;nyeates&gt; I might also might try Novells iFolder, which is free open source now....anyone experience iFolder? Its dropbox but you gotta set it all up and have a server and client on each participating comp<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:42:38] &lt;csabo&gt; why not use dropbox?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:42:40] &lt;csabo&gt; seems like less work <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:42:44] &lt;nyeates&gt; true<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:42:50] &lt;nyeates&gt; but i want to do it with 2 TB<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:43:01] &lt;csabo&gt; oh lol<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:43:08] &lt;csabo&gt; whats their pricing model for that?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:43:17] &lt;csabo&gt; if you're keeping it internal, just use rysnc<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:43:18] &lt;nyeates&gt; OR, i could get rif of my HD movies....but itd still be 800Gigs and expenseive on dropbox<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:43:28] &lt;csabo&gt; www.rysnc.net<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:44:19] &lt;nyeates&gt; i dont think my wife would know how to add a folder to be rsynced when she makes a new music directory on her mac<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:44:22] &lt;csabo&gt; ^ heard good things about them if you want it external<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:44:32] &lt;nyeates&gt; unless it was all in the same folder structure i guess<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:45:18] &lt;nyeates&gt; are u meaning the linux rsync?<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:45:20] &lt;nyeates&gt; http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:45:21] &lt;jmp242&gt; iFolder sucks - at least the last time I tried it<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:45:40] &lt;jmp242&gt; I wanted to use it to back up laptops to a local sync point that could then be backed up to tape<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:45:48] &lt;jmp242&gt; it would just stop working randomly<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:46:07] &lt;jmp242&gt; Finally, after no updates or fixes for a year, we gave up<br/>[07-Dec-2010 15:46:07] &lt;nyeates&gt; jmp: what part of it would stop working?

oh yeah<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:28:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; it hides the command line arguments when executing the commands<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:28:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's excellent<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:29:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; just a thought, if you could modify it to sensor the password when executing test commands it would be stellar<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:29:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; these passwords are generally quite sensitive<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:29:36] &lt;ericenns&gt; yeah I was thinking about that today<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:30:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; wouldn't be overly difficult, just set a new variable from the command variable<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:30:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then run a regex against it<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:30:37] &lt;ericenns&gt; yup just have to find where it prints it out<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:30:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's in the datasource file<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:31:02] &lt;ericenns&gt; yup I knew that<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:31:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I changed my message to "Calculating formula "1 + 1 (or whatever)" against device whatever"<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:31:25] &lt;ericenns&gt; guess I got time, since my custom ubuntu is still building<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:31:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:31:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; custom ubuntu eh?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:32:05] &lt;ericenns&gt; while more like pre-configured, we use ubuntu at work with AD authentication and some people have trouble setting that up<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:32:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:32:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:32:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I set that up the other day on a CentOS box<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:32:41] &lt;ericenns&gt; ok cool<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:32:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; since I'm migrating a CVS server from windows to linux<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:32:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; and they use AD auth for CVS<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:32:54] &lt;ericenns&gt; i see<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:33:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; (this is for a client of ours, I'm going to their site tomorrow to continue the project(<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:33:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; )<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:33:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; This is the only on-site project I've ever done, but I'm the Linux guy around here<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:33:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; this is mostly a windows shop<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:33:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; really just me and my manager are linux guys<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:33:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; we also have a unix engineer but he's more solaris/hpux/aix, that sort of thing<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:33:56] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh I see, we are strictly ubuntu for desktop centos for server<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:34:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd love to work at your place lol<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:34:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; My manager and I have ubuntu desktops<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:34:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; everyone else is windows<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:34:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a windows 7 VM running in virtualbox<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:34:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I use it for outlook and vmware<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:34:49] &lt;ericenns&gt; I see most of run a windows vm<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:35:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; (vmware's management software not running in Linux natively == epic fail)<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:35:33] &lt;ericenns&gt; I know, oh what was that zencommand test I told you yesterday<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:35:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; which one?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:35:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't recall<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:35:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; zencommand run -v10 -d?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:35:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; you mean?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:36:02] &lt;ericenns&gt; Just figured it out yeah that was it<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:36:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:36:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you can do that with practically any daemon<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:36:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, if you want the daemon to continue cycling as it normally would, but in the foreground you just add --cycle<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:36:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; zencommand run -v10 --cycle<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:39:00] &lt;ericenns&gt; ok<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:40:04] &lt;dec3pti0n&gt; wondering if I can really trust this ntpmonitor drifting <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> hope i can<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:43:29] &lt;kokey&gt; there was some redhat 64bit problem on some hp systems with a strange bios that made it gain 10 seconds every minute<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:43:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; weird<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:43:56] &lt;kokey&gt; i ran a chron job every minute to sync it to the ntp server until hopefully someone did the upgrade<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:44:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:44:32] &lt;kokey&gt; that was the same place i discovered the problem with oracle client libraries hanging if the system uptime was over 180 days<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:44:46] &lt;dec3pti0n&gt; kokey: so the ntpmonitor helped alerting that ?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:45:08] &lt;kokey&gt; when that contract was finishing i had an interview at the guardian and somehow that problem came up<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:45:32] &lt;kokey&gt; they asked me how i fixed it, and i explained to them the stuff i had to do to hack an unofficial oracle patch into the system<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:45:43] &lt;kokey&gt; they told me they just solved it by rebooting twice a year<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:46:06] &lt;kokey&gt; dec3pti0n: this was in 2007 so i didn't use ntpmonitor<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:46:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; ericenns: it's not always hiding the options when running the script<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:46:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just saw it run with them visible<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:46:52] &lt;ericenns&gt; yeah I see it show them in zencommand<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:47:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; showing them in zencommand doesn't matter<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:47:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's when it shows them in the actual datasource test, or at the commandline<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:47:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the issue<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:47:22] &lt;ericenns&gt; ok well where are you seeing it<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:47:32] &lt;ericenns&gt; commandline with what?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:47:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I running htop (like top)<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:47:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm*<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:47:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; for the most part is does "Hiding the command line arguments"<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:48:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; but sometimes it shows them<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:48:38] &lt;ericenns&gt; ok I'm not sure right now how to fix that<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:48:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, just something to look in to at some point <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:49:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=308126<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:49:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; here's a thread on it<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:52:13] &lt;ericenns&gt; rmatte: something you could do at the moment is create a read only user for vsphere<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:52:40] &lt;ericenns&gt; thats what I use<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:53:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it doesn't matter at the moment since I'm just testing<br/>[08-Dec-2010 11:53:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, that is a good idea<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:07:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmmm<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:08:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; is there any way to collect disk and interface stats from the host via that?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:08:38] &lt;ericenns&gt; possibly that is on the future list<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:08:43] * rmatte nods<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:09:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, awesome man, good job<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:09:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:09:14] &lt;ericenns&gt; thanks<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:09:40] &lt;ericenns&gt; I don't know If I have set up any alerting on the graphs yet<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:09:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; once I get my computer monitor at home fixed I'll start working on updates to the formula datasource pack<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:09:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah you haven't, but that's easily doable<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:10:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; especially since memory and CPU usage are in percentages<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:10:17] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh ok, yup<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:10:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; the disk usage doesn't really make sense<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:10:34] &lt;ericenns&gt; for warnings?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:11:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's telling me 22.09k usage on a server that has a 10GB filesystem with almost 5GB used<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:11:10] &lt;ericenns&gt; Those graphs are supposed to look just like enterprise<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:11:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I don't get what that value is supposed to represent<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:11:18] &lt;ericenns&gt; thats not that disk usage its Kps<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:11:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so it's I/O<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:11:28] &lt;ericenns&gt; kbps I mean<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:11:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; You should change the title of the graph to Disk I/O<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:11:45] &lt;LiamMac&gt; Can anyone tell me how the interface status lights are updated I have an interface that's operation status shows as down if I check the "IpInterface" page but the "status" light on the OS page still shows as green<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:11:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; LiamMac: yes...<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:12:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; LiamMac: an event needs to come in for the /Status/IpInterface event class (which needs to be created by hand), and it needs to have the interface name as the component of the event<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:12:30] &lt;ericenns&gt; just gotta read the&#160; y axis there rmatte nudge nudge<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:12:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; LiamMac: read this: docs/DOC-2494<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:13:02] &lt;LiamMac&gt; thanks rmatte that's exactly what I was looking for<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:13:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; ericenns: true, but still lol<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:13:22] &lt;ericenns&gt; blame enterprise for that I blatantly ripped there graphs off<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:13:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:13:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; good man then<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:13:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:13:40] &lt;ericenns&gt; haha yup lol<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:13:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, interface and LUN info will be killer<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:14:09] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:14:20] &lt;ericenns&gt; yes it would<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:15:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a write-up that I need to get to some time soon<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:16:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a monitoring technique complimentary to the interface status polling write-up<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:16:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; it uses ifLastChange to detect if an interface status changed between polling cycles<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:16:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you never miss an interface reset<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:16:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; and don't need to use traps, which vary between different types of devices and can be unreliable<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:16:47] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh yeah<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:17:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I spent a whole day configuring/testing it, then put it in to production, and it's been working great<br/>[08-Dec-2010 12:57:27] &lt;dec3pti0n&gt; rmatte: u mentioned to remove that %s from the graph point format .. is there one for the alerting too ? cause I'm testing with 0.002 and I get the alert summary as "hreshold of Ntpdrift exceeded: current value 0.00"<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:15:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; dec3pti0n: thresholds default to 2 decimal places<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:15:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure if there's a way to change that, I don't recall ever seeing one<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:16:47] &lt;ablew&gt; anybody know how to change the default production states that are selected?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:16:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; ablew: yes, in settings<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:17:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; Advanced -&gt; Settings<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:17:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll see "State Conversions"<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:17:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; different value ranges represent different things<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:17:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; what exactly are you looking to create?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:21:13] &lt;ablew&gt; yea...i'm just trying to make it so pre-production and testing are always in my view of devices<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:31:21] &lt;dec3pti0n&gt; this is strange on zenoss 3.0 version when I try to edit a graph point I show no name for it<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:32:48] &lt;ericenns&gt; jb are you jbeard in the community<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:39:16] &lt;csabo&gt; hes jailbait<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:42:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; dec3pti0n: that's a known bug<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:43:44] &lt;rmatte&gt;

yeh<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:59:49] &lt;ablew&gt; by default the only production state that is selected is "Production"<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:59:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, you want it to always be more?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 13:59:59] &lt;ablew&gt; i'd like to adjust that<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:00:00] &lt;ablew&gt; yep<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:00:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmmm, not sure if that's possible, it should technically save the last view that you had like the event console does<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:00:33] &lt;ablew&gt; i don't think it does<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:00:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; If it doesn't, I'd call that a bug<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:00:41] &lt;ablew&gt; it seems to lose it as i navigate around<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:00:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just tested and yeh, it defaults to just production<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:01:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; and doesn't save<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:01:42] &lt;ablew&gt; at least it's not just me <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:01:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; nope<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:02:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; they should technically show all devices by default<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:02:27] &lt;ablew&gt; yea...it'd be great to be able to set a preference<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:02:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:02:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; open a trac ticket for it<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:02:50] &lt;ablew&gt; do you have the URL handy?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:02:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; dev.zenoss.com/trac login with zenoss/zenoss<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:06:36] rhettardo_ is now known as rhettardo<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:09:08] &lt;kevin7kal&gt;

is there a menu on the left?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:09:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; or at the top?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:10:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; (do you see "DASHBOARD, EVENTS, INFRASTRUCTURE, etc... listed at the top?"<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:11:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; or do you see "Dashboard, Event Console, Device List, etc..." listed down the left hand side?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:12:41] &lt;kevin7kal&gt; at the top right I have search with username, Preferences, Logout, and Help underneath.<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:12:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, so it's the old interface<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:13:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to Settings<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:13:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; then click on the Versions tab<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:13:09] &lt;kevin7kal&gt;

it's probably 2.5.x<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:13:34] &lt;kevin7kal&gt; yes - 2.5<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:13:36] &lt;kevin7kal&gt; Thanks!<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:13:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2.5.what?<br/>[08-Dec-2010 14:13:46] &lt;rmatte&gt;

2.7 is released. 2.7.1 is the current python2 version.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:01:44] &lt;enjoi&gt; interesting<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:01:47] &lt;fragfutter&gt; if you only read the first line of the link, that is 2.7.1 is a bugfix release... please continue reading.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:01:58] &lt;csabo&gt; owned<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:02:11] &lt;csabo&gt; lol rmatte will be on 2.5 when everyone else is on 4<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:02:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; only if they don't fix the bugs with the template editing<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:02:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; which I personally went over with Nick, and he took notes<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:02:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; so hopefully they'll be resolved in time for the next release<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:03:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can't work with templates in 3.0, it's like being handcuffed<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:03:50] &lt;csabo&gt; i figured you'd like that<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:03:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just did something to a template in 2.5 that would have taken me 5 times as long in 3.0<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:04:32] &lt;csabo&gt; i cant imagine jumping to 4.0.. wouldnt make any sense<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:04:47] &lt;csabo&gt; 3.0 was a new gui, some broken stuff. i guess i can see that<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:04:59] &lt;csabo&gt; so is 4.0 going to be the 3.0 gui with everything actually working, like 2.5?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:05:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, 4.0 has some major changes<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:05:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the next version I mean<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:05:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; It has relstorage for one thing, which is huge<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:05:36] &lt;csabo&gt; the ability to monitor a host by dns not ip in that list by anychance?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:05:41] &lt;csabo&gt; relstorage? what is that<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:05:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; also a whole new reporting system<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:06:01] &lt;fragfutter&gt; csabo: storing in a relational database instead of zodb<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:06:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; relstorage acts as a layer between MySQL and Zope, meaning everything will be stored in MySQL instead of a Data.fs file<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:06:06] &lt;csabo&gt; oh <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:06:10] &lt;csabo&gt; cool fragfutter<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:06:25] &lt;csabo&gt; should improve performance i'd imagine<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:06:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; It should dramatically improve performance<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:06:40] &lt;fragfutter&gt; csabo: i like zodb. forcing everything into a relational database schema is not my thing.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:07:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; fragfutter: it's still going to behave the same way<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:07:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; from a user standpoint there's no difference<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:07:23] &lt;csabo&gt; honestly, i didnt know it wasnt already using mysql.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:07:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; It uses MySQL to store events<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:07:33] &lt;csabo&gt; i never would have guessed a product made for large environments would use a flat file<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:07:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; but everything else is stored in a Data.fs flat file<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:07:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; in $ZENHOME/var/Data.fs<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:07:49] &lt;csabo&gt; ah<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:07:56] &lt;csabo&gt; lol @ zenoss/zenoss<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:08:01] &lt;csabo&gt; are they gonna fix that in avalon? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:08:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; That's not a bug man<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:08:08] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: yep. i know. seen the talks about relstorage when it came up in 2001 <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:08:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; everyone thinks it is, but it's not<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:08:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; /usr/local/zenoss contains all of the environment files, such as python, and other linux binaries<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:08:39] &lt;ericenns&gt; thats just the way the all in one installer works<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:08:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; then /usr/local/zenoss/zenoss contains the actual Zenoss files<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:08:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; /usr/local/zenoss contains MySQL too<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:09:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's their way of packaging everything in to a single package<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:09:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; and having a separate environment for Zenoss<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:09:24] &lt;fragfutter&gt; zodb is not a flat file, it is structured. think like bdb files.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:09:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you install via RPM it installs differently<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:09:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; it goes to /opt/zenoss<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:09:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the rest is all in it's standard system location<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:10:26] &lt;enjoi&gt; damn zenoss<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:10:27] * csabo changes rmatts $HOME to /home/rmatte/rmatte <br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:10:29] &lt;csabo&gt; see how you like it<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:10:36] &lt;csabo&gt; hehe<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:10:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; I like the fact that all the dependencies are in /usr/local/zenoss, means the rest of the system can't mess with Zenoss' environment<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:10:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; you don't magically find out one day that Python has been upgraded and Zenoss is complaining<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:11:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; csabo: if $HOME == $ZENHOME then I'd agree with you, but it doesn't <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:11:39] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: that's a terrible example <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> all the zenoss packages come with their own python<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:11:41] &lt;Simon4&gt; even the RPM<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:11:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; I suppose they could have made it /usr/local/zenenv/zenoss or something<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:11:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; but whatever<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:12:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: I haven't used the RPM, I've just read about it, and I didn't think it did<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:12:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; I thought it installed it as a dep<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:12:14] &lt;Simon4&gt;

that's crazy that the metrodome's roof collapsed<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:26:51] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yep<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:26:53] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; little bit o snow<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:29:07] &lt;enjoi&gt; Snow<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:47:55] * davetoo yawns<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:50:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; the way it fell it looked more like water than snow lol<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:50:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; crazy<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:54:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; ?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:54:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; just when it hit the field, the way it sort of splashed<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:54:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; I got caught in a sleetburst once <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:55:11] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Got so thick that everybody slowed down and stopped.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:55:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; Long enough for people to get out of their cars and chat <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:55:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:56:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; So... with Egor's distributed collector pack,<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:56:35] &lt;davetoo&gt; how do you force it to model devices and suchlike?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:56:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; i.e. how do you run zenoss commands on the remotes<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:57:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you have to literally run it on the remote<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:57:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; 'k<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:57:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; as part of the setup though you setup an ssh keypair yes?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:57:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you could just execute the commands remotely via ssh without having to actually login to a prompt<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:57:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; Haven't done it yet.&#160; Couple of days I wll be<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:57:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:58:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; I wonder how that's all going to work (or not) after Avalon is released<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:58:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd imagine it'll work the same<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:59:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; might require a few updates or something<br/>[13-Dec-2010 12:59:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; but Egor is good about maintaining his packs<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:00:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; The Events are what I'm worried about<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:02:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; why's that?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:03:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; because of the new RabitMQ messaging infrastructure<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:03:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, I hadn't even heard of that<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:03:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; either way, don't be in a rush to upgrade until you know it's going to work<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:03:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what gets people in to trouble<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:03:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; "ZOMFG! NEW RELEASE!

I have good reason to be interested, though; Client wants to do some crazy stuff and RelStorage would help<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:05:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; for sure<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:05:48] * Sam-I-Am is enjoying mass template building<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:06:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; mass?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:06:24] &lt;davetoo&gt; how?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:07:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; just a lot of them... primarily making one, then using the zope backend to copy it with some adjustments<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:07:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; yeah, somehow I expect to be using ZMI a lot with v3<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:07:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, the template copying is one of the things that I showed Nick<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:07:46] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i tend to find it easier for certain things<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:07:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; we did a webex session and I showed him the problems with it<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:07:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; so hopefully he'll be able to bring it to their attention and they can fix it<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:08:05] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; this is 2.5.2<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:08:08] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; but i did try 3<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:08:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:08:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; Besides being named weirdly, what's wrong with it?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:08:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; I haven't actuall run a worknig copy of 3 yet<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:08:24] &lt;davetoo&gt; working<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:08:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2.5.2 isn't so bad, but I know what you mean, I used ZMI in the same way when I was making my Windows SNMP Performance (Advanced) ZenPack<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:09:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; well I spent a lot of time in ZMI figuring out LDAP auth.&#160; Even with Enterprise.&#160; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:09:14] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its easier to mass-rename stuff in zmi after copying too<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:09:27] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ldap auth wasnt too bad here, but it did require zmi<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:09:39] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; kinda surprised thats not built into the general config on enterprise<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:09:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; LDAP auth was easy for me in 2.5, pain in the ass in 3.0 so far, but I think it's because I don't have all the correct libraries on the system<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:10:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; it can't be built in to the general config since it's dependant on system libraries<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:10:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; on a virtual appliance it could<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:10:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; I had to monkey with the user caching, I think<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:10:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:11:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; plus Corp IT's LDAP servers all behaved differently<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:11:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; was very odd<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:11:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, we just have 1<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:11:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; We had some users who never could log in via LDAP and I never figured out why.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:11:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; probably something simple<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:11:58] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'm kinda surprised the ldap thinger doesnt support tls yet<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:12:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; So I set up system accounts for them<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:12:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; yeah, it was all the old-timers like me who still had Unix email.&#160; Something about the way it searched for users, I think.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:12:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I can't go the system account route, too many servers<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:13:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; It gets *really* confused when you have a system account username that matches an LDAP username.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:13:13] &lt;rmatte&gt;

OK.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:58:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:58:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just going to be a standalone SIM<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:58:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's analyzing syslogs and pulling down events from cisco ips devices via SDEE<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:59:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it will be generating alerts if we can ever figure out how to tune it to do so<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:59:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; SDEE?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:59:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; the tuning interfaces are horrific and what little documentation we've found hasn't been much help<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:59:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; Yeh, it basically logs in to the device's web interface and pulls the data down<br/>[13-Dec-2010 13:59:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a Cisco thing<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:00:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; sounds hackish <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:00:21] &lt;rmatte&gt;

do you get XML?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:00:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not sure how it grabs it's it's a pre-built plugin that comes with OSSIM<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:01:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's limited to gathering from 1 device but I hacked around and managed to get 2 going<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:01:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; (for the SDEE)<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:02:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'll have to look at the docs.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:02:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; Do you build ACLs with log statements or what?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:02:12] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I mean how does the Cisco generate events?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:03:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2 of the cisco devices generate them via syslog... rsyslog gathers it and scrapes the log file, then logs the events in to MySQL<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:03:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I have the log file that it's scraping rotating daily<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:04:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; the other 2 devices, OSSIM logs in to them every few seconds and grabs any recent events via SDEE<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:04:34] &lt;davetoo&gt;

so with Zenoss 2.5.2, when you looked at a Device organizer page with.. hundreds of devices, or more, the time to query the events/status tables made the page load/build incredibly slow.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:05:33] &lt;davetoo&gt;

right<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:07:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, the only thing stored in MySQL are events, so viewing devices has nothing to do with MySQL at all<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:07:27] * davetoo looks up "mysql storage engine comparison"<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:07:31] &lt;rmatte&gt;

oh<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:08:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you're right, it does<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:08:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it only checks active events<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:08:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is a 2 second check compared to event history<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:08:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless you have a gazillion active events<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:11:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; blah<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:11:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; msql.com wants a login to read this whitepaper<br/>[13-Dec-2010 14:11:32] &lt;rmatte&gt;

may not use it on everything, but it could be useful for polling<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:21:29] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; mostly in 3.x though which has a bug in OAM<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:21:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I poll interface status and ifLastChange on every interface I monitor<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:21:50] &lt;rmatte&gt;

My question is around the Object Name, it appears that zenjmx does not support wild cards, or in some cases regular expressions.&#160; Would anybody know if this is by design, or it either are supposed to be supported?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:39:26] &lt;jrbrown&gt; For example, I ma trying the following string hadoop:service=DataNode,name=DataNodeActivity*&#160; to match an object name similar to DataNodeActivity-DS-1591638972-10.200.32.8-50010-1289644188785.&#160; The values after DS- change from machine to machine so I need a to match on a wild card or a regex.....<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:42:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: lastchange is a timestamp of when the last interface status change was<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:42:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; the timestamp is the number of timeticks since the device booted<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:42:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I use a counter datasource to monitor that and threshold if it increases at all<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:42:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; that tells me if an interface reset between polls<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:42:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; that way I don't miss even the quickest resets<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:43:03] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ah, interesting<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:53:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm going to do a writeup for it, but not today<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:53:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; whenever I have some time<br/>[13-Dec-2010 15:54:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll be similar to the polling writeup<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:10:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; ericenns: you around?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:12:04] &lt;ericenns&gt; for the moment<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:12:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; k... should your pack be trying to collect data for VMs that aren't actually running?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:12:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's doing it for one of them and fails every time<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:13:01] &lt;ericenns&gt; by fail what do you mean?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:13:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; as in I get a command failed event<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:13:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; every polling cycle<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:13:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just added a transform to filter them out for now<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:13:34] &lt;ericenns&gt; hmm I don't get that in 3.0<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:14:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; Code: 1 - Msg: General error<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:14:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; when it fails<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:14:24] &lt;ericenns&gt; I don't remember putting anything specific in there to stop it from that<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:14:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; It only seems to be doing it on my vSphere server though<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:14:52] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh ok<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:15:04] &lt;ericenns&gt; can you run the command manually?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:15:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll try to figure out what's causing it<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:15:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; when I run it manually I get no output at all<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:15:15] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh ok umm are you running 1.1.1<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:15:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; just 1.1 I think<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:15:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; what does 1.1.1 fix?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:15:58] &lt;ericenns&gt; that makes sense, oh ok in 1.1.1 I do a tail -n1 instead of 2&gt; /dev/null for zenoss 3 compatibility<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:16:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:17:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have tons of gaps in my graphs too<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:17:24] &lt;ericenns&gt; yeah make it work in one break it another<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:17:54] &lt;ericenns&gt; is that just for your vsphere server or for all<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:17:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll try increasing my zCommandCommandTimeout value<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:18:13] &lt;ericenns&gt; yeah the backend scripts take a while to run<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:18:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; seems to be doing it mostly on the vsphere server<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:18:33] &lt;ericenns&gt; that makes sense<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:18:56] &lt;ericenns&gt; since that is quering a bunch of data<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:18:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just increased the timeout from 15 to 60, I'll see if that makes a difference<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:19:22] &lt;ericenns&gt; ok<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:19:53] &lt;ericenns&gt; I am leaving shortly but I may log onto irc at home depends<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:20:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, I'm out in about an hour anyways<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:20:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; the graphs on my actual ESX boxes look great though<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:21:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; Meh, I'm not even going to bother monitoring the vSphere server, it's redundant anyways<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:21:23] &lt;ericenns&gt; cool next thing on my list is interface modeling<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:21:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:21:45] &lt;ericenns&gt; yeah better to go to the actual machines removes the single point of failure<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:21:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you need help with that, I've done work with interface modeler plugins before<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:22:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I've only done snmp stuff<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:22:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I doubt it'll be overly difficult<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:22:17] &lt;ericenns&gt; ok that would be nice I got to make the back end script thought first<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:22:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; just need to use the linux command interface plugin as reference<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:22:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:22:55] &lt;ericenns&gt; might be better to look at my existing modeler plugins<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:23:20] &lt;ericenns&gt; but I'm off now later<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:23:23] * ericenns away<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:23:42] &lt;rmatte&gt;

ok cool<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:37:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; the eventClassKey is really what matters<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:37:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; the name can be anything<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:38:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, so now any events coming in with that eventClassKey will be ignored<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:38:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you can adjust the mapping to make it more specific<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:38:25] &lt;rhys&gt; so first it checks eventClassKey, then RegEx?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:38:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, regex checks the summary... but you can also use rules...<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:38:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; for example...<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:38:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; you see the "Rule" box at the top?<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:39:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can add something to that box like...<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:39:19] &lt;rhys&gt; yes.<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:39:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; if evt.summary = "This text" or evt.summary = "This other text" or evt.summary = "blah"<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:39:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then the mapping will only apply to events matching those event properties<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:40:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, lets say you wanted some events to go to history and some to be dropped entirely, then you could use a transform<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:40:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; you would set the action in zProperties to status (or whatever you want the default to be) and then you'd do something like...<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:40:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; if evt.summary = "This text":<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:40:44] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160; evt._action = 'drop'<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:40:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; oops sorry...<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:40:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; if evt.summary == "This text":<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:41:00] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;

and you can access the event properties with evt.whatever<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:41:59] &lt;rhys&gt; ah<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:42:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; evt.summary, evt.message, evt.severity, etc...<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:42:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; and do anything you want<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:42:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can even modify the event itself<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:42:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; evt.summary = 'whatever'<br/>[13-Dec-2010 16:42:20] &lt;rmatte&gt;

"remote hub"?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:05:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; first time deploying remote anything here<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:05:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; rmatte: one of the Enterprise options<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:05:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; Sam-I-Am: you don't.<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:05:45] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah, apparently you can have remote hubs<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:05:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; pretty sure that's just for redundancy<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:06:10] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; didnt think so, but the docs werent too particular on what each one does (well, what more the hub does)<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:06:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; either that, or it's to have a single point of collection on a client's network which then feeds it back to the main elsewhere<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:06:16] &lt;Simon4&gt; it's not for redundancy<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:06:30] &lt;Simon4&gt; it's for "uber" scaling apparently, when things get busy enough that you need more than one hub<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:06:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; I was told that the connection between the daemons and the hub is more robust than hub-to-zodb<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:06:35] &lt;Simon4&gt; (or so I was told)<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:06:43] &lt;Simon4&gt; davetoo: I would agree with that<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:06:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; that was almost two years ago<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:07:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's probably for situation where you would have say 3 different subnets feeding back to the hub, then the hub feeding back to the master, so the master can't talk directly to any of those 3 subnets<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:07:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; and the daemons are slowly being made more robust there as well.<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:07:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; for security reasons or whatever<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:07:24] &lt;davetoo&gt; Sam-I-Am: Enterprise, yes?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:07:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh he's running ent<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:08:06] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: I tested exactly that, and it still worked better with just theone hub and multiple collectors via a vpn tunnel<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:08:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; of course you'll want some worker hub threads configured.&#160; Depending upon * of cpu cores<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:08:17] * rmatte shrugs<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:08:22] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; davetoo: yep<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:10:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; now... when Avalon comes out, that will be interesting<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:11:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; the hub will also be talking to a new daemon (zeneventd)<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:12:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's with that new RabbitMQ thing or whatever it's called<br/>[14-Dec-2010 10:12:26] &lt;davetoo&gt;

hmm, not familiar with that... are you using a zenpack?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 13:59:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; joko: have you tried an "snmpdf" to see if that drive even shows up via snmp?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 13:59:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; that filesystem, rather<br/>[14-Dec-2010 13:59:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: for iflastchange, did you do counter or derive/min=0 ?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 13:59:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; let me check, I think it was counter but I'll make sure<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:00:49] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; noticed my network gear got a new feature recently... when you clear counters in the CLI, it doesnt clear SNMP<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:02:53] &lt;mducharme-laptop&gt; afternoon<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:03:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: http://fpaste.org/YHpw/raw/<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:03:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's everything I did<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:03:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh sorry, forgot to include the datasource type in that<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:03:20] * rmatte doh<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:03:24] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; lol<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:04:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; http://fpaste.org/R8Mf/raw/<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:04:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; voila<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:05:15] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ah, so it is a derive<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:05:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:05:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; the transform was the tricky part though<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:06:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; not too tricky, but took some time and testing<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:07:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; thanks<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:10:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:19:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; btw, if you need any semi-nifty rrd graph definition recipies...<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:22:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; will do <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:23:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; certain devices can be a bit buggy when it comes to the ifLastChange value, so if you find a device is spamming the crap out of you with alerts because the value is constantly changing but isn't affecting the port, just disable the threshold for that one specific interface<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:23:10] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; havent done a lot of other creative stuff yet that you havent done yet<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:23:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've had that happen a few times, but it's been less than 20 interfaces out of thousands<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:24:09] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; right now i use traps for that, but depending on the situation, the 'up' trap gets lost<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:25:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; down traps can get lost too<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:25:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not very reliable<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:25:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah, same there<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:25:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus I monitor lots of different types of devices<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:25:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; not all of them send interface traps<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:25:42] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so i think polling might work a little better<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:25:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the ones that do, the traps are different between different makes<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:25:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; and models<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:26:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; junipers are nice enough to queue traps<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:26:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; polling ifOperStatus and ifLastChange is the best blanket solution<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:26:15] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; but it only knows if it can't directly reach the next hop<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:26:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:26:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; it doesn't see problems down the line<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:41:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; should i send traps to the collector or the hub?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:44:19] &lt;nzle&gt; rmatte:&#160;&#160; I have a command template for a host which has the 'use ssh' option checked.&#160; This should cause it to execute the script in the template on the host, right.&#160;&#160; Its not doing it, its not trying to ssh to it at all.&#160;&#160; Can you advise what may be going on?&#160;&#160; This was working before.&#160; I have tried restarting zenoss,&#160;&#160; and I have verified the IP for the host, and the credential in zproperties.<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:45:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; nzle: do you have your zProperties configured correctly?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:45:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; the username and password need to be specified in them<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:46:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh nevermind<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:46:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see you have<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:46:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; login to the server as the zenoss user<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:46:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; then do...<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:46:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; zencommand run -v10 -d devicename<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:46:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; replace devicename with the name of the device obviously<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:46:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; that'll give you details as to what zencommand is doing, and you'll see any errors that it is encountering<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:50:14] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; meh<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:50:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; theres not much documentation on enterprise features<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:51:13] &lt;nzle&gt; Ok that showed the ssh being done.&#160; Ill examin it to see where my script is breakin gdown.&#160; thanx<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:53:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; Simon4: you round?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:53:59] &lt;joko&gt;&#160; hmm<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:54:19] &lt;nzle&gt; rmatte:&#160; also, could you suggest why events caused by this template are coming up with a component of zencommand, instead of the meaninful component I have configured in the template?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:55:36] &lt;joko&gt; snmpdf, interesting<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:56:59] &lt;joko&gt; very cool lil program<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:57:35] &lt;joko&gt; but yeah, it doesn't grab network drive info <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:59:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; joko: there's a net-snmp config option to make it<br/>[14-Dec-2010 14:59:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, actually it's to skip them<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:00:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, that's the one<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:00:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; storageUseNFS 1<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:00:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; try adding that to you snmpd.conf<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:00:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; (if you're using net-snmp)<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:01:06] &lt;joko&gt; well, yeah, it's windows cifs<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:01:10] &lt;joko&gt; DFS, whatever<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:01:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's mapped to a linux box?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:01:40] &lt;joko&gt; nope<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:01:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, so this is a network drive on a windows box using dfs<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:01:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, doubt that's possible<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:01:58] &lt;joko&gt; correct<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:02:02] &lt;joko&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:02:04] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: i know you dont use enterprise, but do you know if traps should get sent to the collector or the main box?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:02:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could probably get it via WMI though<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:02:04] &lt;joko&gt; darn<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:02:07] &lt;joko&gt; yea<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:02:14] &lt;joko&gt; i was thinking mayybe WMI<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:02:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: collector<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:02:29] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; interesting<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:02:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: the collector runs zentrap and forwards them to zenhub on the master<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:03:03] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ahh, so same on enterprise as the zenpack for community?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:03:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only things running on the collector are things like zenperfsnmp, zentrap, zensyslog, zenwin<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:03:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; and all of those connect back to zenhub on the master<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:03:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; I believe so, the community method is based on the enterprise method<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:03:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; It wouldn't make much sense to have traps having to go the master<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:03:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; but then being able to monitor everything else on the collectors<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:03:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; same with syslogs<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:04:04] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; aight<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:04:11] * Sam-I-Am heads to a meeting<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:05:20] &lt;joko&gt; hmm<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:05:38] &lt;joko&gt; rmatte: do you work for zenoss? i always see you on the community forums<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:06:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; nope<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:06:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; wish I did lol<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:07:06] &lt;nzle&gt; I thought you did..<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:07:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; I work for a company called Nova Networks<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:07:09] &lt;joko&gt; sounds like it <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:07:10] &lt;rmatte&gt;

wow, nice<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:07:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; and 3 lab instances<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:07:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:07:42] &lt;joko&gt;

yeh, we do monitoring for different clients so we have 1 per client for our larger clients, and then a few multi-client servers<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:14] &lt;joko&gt; ahh<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm, meeting rescheduled<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it all feeds back in to our ticketing system<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:25] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yay for one more hour of productivity<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:29] &lt;joko&gt; what version do you prefer?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; tickets get automatically opened for alerts<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:36] &lt;joko&gt; nice<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm using 2.5.2 in production<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:40] &lt;joko&gt; yea<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; waiting for 3.x to shape up<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:44] &lt;joko&gt; 2.5.2 is pretty nice<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:48] &lt;joko&gt; same<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:50] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; and i'm using 2.5.2 as per rmatte's opinion <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:08:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:09:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i tried 3... it was... needswork<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:09:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:09:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a 3.x lab that I've been upgrading as they do new releases<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:09:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it's still not production-worthy in my opinion<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:09:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's mostly the template editing that drives me nuts in the new UI<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:09:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I had a webex session with Nick Yeates and brought those bugs to his attention<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:10:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; hopefully something will be done about them<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:10:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; soon<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:10:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:10:30] &lt;joko&gt; Mapped network drive seems to work with Windows 2003. However the WMI specification says that&#160; this query on mapped drives have been deprecated... please report back you have tested this with later version of Windows server.<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:10:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i figure once i get 2.5.2 perfectly rolled out, 3 will become good.<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:10:37] &lt;joko&gt; WMI Files monitor zenpack<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:10:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; I understand it's a new UI and all, but I can't believe some of the bugs made it past QA<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:10:47] &lt;joko&gt; that was meant to be " "<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:11:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: probably the case<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:11:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; the files monitor zenpack is for monitoring files<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:11:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; not filesystems<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:11:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; just get the WMI Data Source and WMI Windows Performance packs<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:11:54] &lt;joko&gt; yeah, i just saw that<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:11:59] &lt;joko&gt; yeah, i have those<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:11:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; (Make sure they are Egor's packs)<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:12:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; then just model the device<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:12:09] &lt;rmatte&gt;

hmm.<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:12:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; you weren't getting it via SNMP before<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:12:36] &lt;joko&gt; lemme check 'er out<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:12:38] &lt;joko&gt; yea<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:12:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you do full WMI monitoring you should see it<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:12:56] &lt;joko&gt; kk, lets try it<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:13:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a mod that I'm going to do to that pack so that it can see windows mounts<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:13:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; since it can't the way it's currently polling<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:13:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; joko: is it mounted to a drive letter?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:13:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; or is it mounted to a folder?<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:13:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it's mounted to a folder like C:\mymountedfolder<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:14:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you're currently out of luck<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:14:16] &lt;joko&gt; yea, mounted to a drive letter<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:14:30] &lt;joko&gt; logged in as the user WMI uses<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:14:34] &lt;joko&gt; mounted under, that is<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:15:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's mounted as a windows share than rather than an actual drive letter<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:15:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; if so, you're currently out of luck<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:15:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; though that's a project that I'll be working on soon<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:15:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have the WMI queries all figured out<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:15:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; just need to do some coding<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:16:39] &lt;joko&gt; nice<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:19:15] &lt;joko&gt; rmatte: the share is mounted to X:\ for example<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:19:41] &lt;joko&gt; i have to run this damn packet capture before i can look back into it<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:20:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, if it's connected right on X:\ then you're fine<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:20:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, I'm surprised it wasn't available via SNMP<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:21:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I guess mapped drives may get ignored<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:32:35] mray1 is now known as mray<br/>[14-Dec-2010 15:48:05] &lt;joko&gt;

sure<br/>[15-Dec-2010 10:50:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[15-Dec-2010 10:50:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know that going to the edit tab and changing anything messes it up for me<br/>[15-Dec-2010 10:50:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I avoid using the edit tab<br/>[15-Dec-2010 10:50:25] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; doing it in zope?<br/>[15-Dec-2010 10:50:35] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i think the edit tab is the issue<br/>[15-Dec-2010 10:50:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; doing it in zope shouldn't<br/>[15-Dec-2010 10:50:55] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; weird..<br/>[15-Dec-2010 10:50:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; but no, for changing device state for instance, I do it from the device list<br/>[15-Dec-2010 10:50:59] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I wouldnt mind a hint<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:20:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you using 2.5 or 3.0?<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:20:32] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; 3.0<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:20:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, one sec<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:20:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; click on Events at the top<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:20:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; then click on Event Classes<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:21:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; then in the bottom left hand menu (the one with the gear) click Transform<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:21:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; since we're in the /Events class when clicking it, the transform will apply to the whole class<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:21:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; now, the transform should be as follows...<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:22:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; if evt.component.startswith('Health Service Modules_')<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:22:56] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160; evt._action = 'drop'<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:23:09] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; tnx <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:23:10] &lt;rmatte&gt;

yeah I know that much pyhton<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:23:27] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:23:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; paste that in there and save, problem solved<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:23:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; k cool<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:25:11] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; just one more question in that generally usable for other parts orf event (for example eventClassKey)<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:25:33] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; or is it just some of the fields that can be checked that way ?<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:25:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's usable for anything, heck, you can block all events from a specific device using evt.device if you want to<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:25:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; evt.whatever<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:25:55] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; tnx<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:26:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:26:04] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; that is gonna prove really usefull<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:26:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; transforms are godly<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:26:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk for a sec<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:30:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, the thing to understand is that a transform is a python script with certain things pre-imported<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:30:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you can access event values via the evt object<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:30:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; but since it's a python script the sky is the limit<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:31:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can have it do stuff like change the IP of a device in Zenoss if a specific event comes in.<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:31:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; or any attribute of a device really<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:31:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; same goes for any other object<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:31:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can actually modify events with them as well<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:31:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you want a specific event to have a different summary you'd do something like...<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:32:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; evt.summary = "My new summary!"<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:32:13] &lt;csabo&gt; hes lying.<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:32:16] &lt;csabo&gt; dont believe a word he says<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:32:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can also fill in the summary based on other variables<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:32:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; if I had a variable called message for instance...<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:32:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; evt.summary = "Message: %s" % (message)<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:32:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; csabo: <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:33:19] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; just one more question, any searchable online version of api docs ?<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:34:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; tehhobbit: not that I've seen, the developer's guide would be as close as it comes<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:35:38] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; ok<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:41:22] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; Event: 'An alert couldn't be inserted to the database.

no<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:45:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, delete the mappings anyways to be sure<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:46:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; though the transforms should kick off in order, and the /Events transform should go first<br/>[15-Dec-2010 11:51:10] &lt;tehhobbit&gt;&#160;

Is there any way to have it re-discover the guest list and perhaps even migrate RRD files between devices for guests?<br/>[15-Dec-2010 12:33:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; enterprise has a esx modelling daemon that does that kind of thing<br/>[15-Dec-2010 12:33:33] &lt;rmatte&gt;

stuff I'm working on right now is really just informational<br/>[15-Dec-2010 12:35:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; so no performance data you mean?<br/>[15-Dec-2010 12:35:30] &lt;ericenns&gt; thought the interfaces part will get a graph<br/>[15-Dec-2010 12:35:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[15-Dec-2010 12:35:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; would be nice if LUNs got graphs too<br/>[15-Dec-2010 12:36:27] &lt;ericenns&gt; yeah as I have said before I'm working of what I see in enterprise, where there LUNs have no graphs, so right now I'm assumming if they can't then I probably can't<br/>[15-Dec-2010 12:37:06] &lt;ericenns&gt;

i believe its using WMI for that<br/>[15-Dec-2010 12:53:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; joko2: there's no specific value just for CPU<br/>[15-Dec-2010 12:53:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a global value<br/>[15-Dec-2010 12:53:10] &lt;rmatte&gt;

actually, that doesn't take average or max<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:11:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; only my rrd scripts do<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:11:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; so just start date and end date<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:12:26] &lt;fus10nx&gt;

obviously devices are going to have very good percentage of uptime over an entire year<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:14:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; if they were down for 7 hours during a year it's almost nothing<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:15:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; but if they were down for 7 hours during a week, the percentage will be much lower<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:15:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; since it's a bigger piece of the pie<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:15:15] &lt;rmatte&gt;

if things are just dropping for a couple minutes then coming back up, and doing that every few minutes, it's not going to be as big of a deal as if a device is totally hard down for hours<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:20:39] &lt;fus10nx&gt; gotcga<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:20:48] &lt;fus10nx&gt; yea i guess we'll have to create the report im looking for<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:20:52] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i figured it would be common<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:20:58] &lt;fus10nx&gt;

what we do for our monthly report is have it run that report script for each day of the month<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:22:14] &lt;csabo&gt; it would be a CF of lines<br/>[15-Dec-2010 15:22:18] &lt;rmatte&gt;

what do you have against the stack install?<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:32:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll also need to copy the RRD files over so you don't lose historical performance data<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:32:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; the zenrestore from the backup may or may not work<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:33:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; If it doesn't work you'll be stuck pretty much moving everything by hand (you can use zenbatchload to speed things up)<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:33:27] &lt;Simon4&gt;

that's true<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:33:44] &lt;Simon4&gt; put em all back on a new box after starting zenoss once and then stopping it, and you should be awesome<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:33:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; just pull the Data.fs across, the problem is, he's moving from stack to something else<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:34:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zope might not like the fact that it's suddenly in a new path<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:34:01] &lt;Simon4&gt; that shouldn't matter for those components<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:34:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:34:17] &lt;wobblyonions&gt; well I will give it a go and feed back to you guys<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:34:30] &lt;wobblyonions&gt; as a metter of interest what RAID what you guys suggest as best for Zenoss etc?<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:34:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; a lot of people use RAID 10<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:34:49] &lt;wobblyonions&gt; and your views on that?<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:34:50] &lt;rhettardo&gt; damnit, this is still screwed up<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:34:51] &lt;Simon4&gt; I keep rrd files on raid 0+1, more spindles = faster<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:35:06] &lt;Simon4&gt; and keep mysql away from rrd and away from Data.fs<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:35:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I use a fiber connected SAN, haven't really worked with Zenoss and a regular RAID setup<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:35:15] &lt;Simon4&gt; those three things are basically your IO hogs<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:35:27] &lt;Simon4&gt;

hmmm<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:35:51] &lt;wobblyonions&gt; will feed back and let you guys know how I get on with the move<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:36:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; rhettardo: the devices all have zPingMonitorIgnore set on the class, and don't have anything set locally for that?<br/>[15-Dec-2010 17:36:26] &lt;rmatte&gt;

oh, yeh, didn't realize you had a collector type setup<br/>[16-Dec-2010 16:38:31] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; didnt think the collector knew much about the mibs<br/>[16-Dec-2010 16:38:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; that would make sense that it needs to be restarted<br/>[16-Dec-2010 16:38:43] &lt;rmatte&gt;

guess i'll wait for the next trap to see if it decodes after restarting the collector<br/>[16-Dec-2010 16:40:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I mean, where does t get set?<br/>[16-Dec-2010 16:40:49] &lt;rmatte&gt;

right, but zenmodel spreads the load pretty well<br/>[16-Dec-2010 17:26:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I mean, it runs regularly by default<br/>[16-Dec-2010 17:27:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it's not like it's doing any more collection on an initial model than it does on it's scheduled runs<br/>[16-Dec-2010 17:28:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; I also have a script you could use... you just have to provide it with a txt files with the device IPs or hostnames line by line and run it<br/>[16-Dec-2010 17:28:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it'll model the devices one at a time<br/>[16-Dec-2010 17:29:01] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt;

lol<br/>[17-Dec-2010 08:55:27] &lt;ericenns&gt; I was at walmart yesterday and all the stereos where on to some crappy hiphop teenager station out here so I turned all there volume controls to zero<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:01:54] &lt;ericenns&gt;

cool<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:10:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm working on coding a MUD this weekend<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:10:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; (text based rpg)<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:11:00] &lt;ericenns&gt; oh I see fun stuff<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:11:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's a project that I have going with a few people from the US and the UK<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:12:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; another guy originally coded the engine and whatever is done of the game so far, but he's lost interest and doesn't have time to finish it<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:12:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I sweet talked my way in to getting the sourcecode<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:12:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:12:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's pretty crazy the amount of coding that he's done<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:12:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; he coded his own compiler/language for the mud itself<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:12:56] &lt;ericenns&gt; ok cool, I got another open source project I was working on but haven't touched it in months<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:13:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is that?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:13:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; (this MUD isn't open source, the coders own the rights to the code, but it'll be free to play)<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:14:09] &lt;ericenns&gt; basically it is a web app which lets you share one scanner, so you use your web browser to use a scanner, I added adf functionality to it and was updating the ui<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:14:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:14:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; very neat<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:15:32] &lt;ericenns&gt; yup at the moment I don't really have a ubuntu machine setup, but I do want to finish it, in the scanner app it also converts scans to text<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:19:53] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

taking a toll on my sanity<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:34:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; grrrr, zenrender, why must you be such a pain in my ass<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:36:14] &lt;joko2&gt; is there any easy trick to monitoring interfaces so they will give an alert?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:37:13] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: yes!<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:38:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; joko2: when they go down you mean?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:39:05] &lt;joko2&gt; yes sir<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:39:07] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i need to get some event transforms going so interface traps get decoded to the interface number or name<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:39:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; joko2: docs/DOC-2494<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:39:22] &lt;joko2&gt; gracias <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:39:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: not difficult to do<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:39:50] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: zenrender choking on something and giving you strange errors?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:40:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: The aggregate report graphs...<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:40:12] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the same problem from a few weeks ago?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:40:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can generate an aggregate report network graph on every one of my Zenoss servers except for one<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:40:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, exact same problem<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:40:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; haven't figured it out yet<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:40:24] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; thats weird<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:40:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's always showing 0 instead of what it should be<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:42:03] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:57:46] &lt;joko2&gt; interesting, an aggregate report network graph, i've been thinking about that myself<br/>[17-Dec-2010 09:58:28] &lt;joko2&gt; would be cool to be able to hone in on switch interfaces that have the most traffic going through them too<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:01:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; interesting<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:01:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I just found out why the graph is always showing as 0<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:01:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I dissected the actual script that generates the graph... it collects the data by doing...<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:01:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; http://fpaste.org/MxtP/<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:01:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I tried that in zope, it only returns 2 interfaces<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:02:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; and they both have 0 bytes going through them since they are loopbacks<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:02:03] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:02:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; so now I just need to figure out why it's only returning those 2 interfaces<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:08:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, I think I see why<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:08:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's actually a flaw in the script<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:09:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; the 64bit templates have ifHCInOctets instead of ifInOctets<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:09:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; the script doesn't take that in to account<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:10:29] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; why are the others working?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:10:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; because I have more devices on them and some of those devices have 32bit templates<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:10:56] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ah<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:11:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; it just so happens that this 1 particular server is mostly 64bit templates<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:11:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the issue was more noticeable<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:11:13] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i find the template selected automagically sometimes isnt correct<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:11:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; tends to work fine for me<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:12:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; either way, I need to add something to the script to fix this<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:12:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i think its only been an issue on my cisco stuff... sometimes zenoss picks a 64-bit template when the interfaces are really only 32-bit<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:19:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:36:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; there, I changed all of the datasources/datapoint names in the 64bit template then ran a script to rename all the RRDs<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:36:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; and now the graph generates<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:36:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; pain in the ass because now I have to do it for the other servers too (15 others)<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:37:35] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; fun times<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:39:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:39:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have to go in to ZMI to actually rename the datapoint under the datasources since it's hidden for SNMP datasources<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:39:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:40:57] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah, i've had to do that<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:46:00] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'd still like to figure out which bug keeps me from copying templates into the pre-created /device/network/cisco tree<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:46:17] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the folks at zenoss confirmed the issue and told me to use zmi (which i was already doing) but its still weird<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:48:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; all templates?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:48:31] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; anything i want to copy into /device/network/cisco ... the entire tree doesnt show up in the list of validtargets<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:48:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; what kind of error do you get when copying them?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:48:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:48:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you tried actually typing "Cisco" in to the dropdown field?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:49:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; (I assume you're using 3.0)<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:49:03] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; 2.5.2<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:49:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:49:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's really weird<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:49:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:49:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't recall there ever being a /Device/Network/Cisco<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:49:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's a /Devices/Network/Router/Cisco<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:49:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is the default path<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:50:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you have /Devices/Network/Cisco you would have had to have created that yourself<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:50:40] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm, i never had a /devices/network/router/cisco<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:50:48] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i think one of the zenpacks did this<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:51:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I never had any cisco ZenPacks when I originally installed Zenoss<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:51:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I distinctly remember there being /Devices/Network/Router/Cisco<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:51:50] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah, i do too... except not in this install<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:51:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're using enterprise though are you not?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:51:53] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yes<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:51:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; then that's probably why<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:51:59] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; stupid enterprise...<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:52:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm used to Core<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:52:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; but they have all their fancy shmancy Cisco monitoring stuff by default in enterprise<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:52:22] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'm not totally convinced i need enterprise<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:52:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I had to build all of mine<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:52:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:52:30] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i wind up rebuilding it anyway<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:52:37] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; strip out all the crap i dont need<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:52:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:53:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wish I had enterprise here, would make life much easier<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:53:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:53:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; but the pricing is crazy<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:53:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; well, in that case, i LOVE enterprise <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:53:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; we don't have a fixed set of devices, we constantly get more and more<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:53:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; so we'd need an MSP license<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:53:27] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i work for a non-profit, so its not nearly as expensive<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:53:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; which would be muchos expensive<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:53:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; we're already barely breaking even<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:53:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:54:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; they should offer unlimited licenses with no support for $10,000/year<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:54:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; if they did I'd scoop it up in 2 seconds<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:55:22] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i should open a ticket on this zenrender heartbeat issue<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:55:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 10:56:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; heartbeat issue?<br/>[17-Dec-2010 11:06:05] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah<br/>[17-Dec-2010 11:06:14] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; heartbeat failure for zenrender on the hub<br/>[17-Dec-2010 11:08:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[17-Dec-2010 11:08:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I get heartbeat failures for all sorts of daemons<br/>[17-Dec-2010 11:08:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; heartbeat events are useless<br/>[17-Dec-2010 11:08:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just ignore them<br/>[17-Dec-2010 11:09:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

they should clear themselves if the event does actually clear<br/>[17-Dec-2010 11:19:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it's not clearing eventually then you probably have an actual problem<br/>[17-Dec-2010 11:19:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; or the hardware that you're running Zenoss on is way too slow<br/>[17-Dec-2010 11:19:48] &lt;Weetos&gt; that's what I thought, does it have to do with the fact my zenoss box isn't named 'localhost'<br/>[17-Dec-2010 11:19:49] &lt;Weetos&gt;

yeh, I think a lot of people would be interested in that<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:02:05] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; .. though what happens if you end up with shared-ownership ZenPacks and Contributors Agreement, I don't know....<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:02:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's a much higher number of people who are savvy enough to author ZenPacks these days<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:02:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I don't think that's much of an issue... you're basically signing away your rights to the ZenPack with the contributors agreement in the first place<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:02:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; so to have 2 people doing that doesn't affect the end result<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:03:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; It'll have to be organized, if 2 or more authors are working on the same pack they need to colaborate to some degree <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:04:16] &lt;nyeates&gt; Maybe attempt to contact the former author - give some time frame for them to get back<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:04:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's what would need to be done<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:05:32] &lt;nyeates&gt; ill mention the idea to some people here, see what they think...also see if we have the time/resources to do it<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:07:46] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; yeh - that's what I've done with a couple of ZenPack updates - contacted the original author first<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:08:27] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; But I and some others, do have issues with signing the carte blanche Contributor Agreement - that's where the legalities can get a little confused<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:10:17] &lt;nyeates&gt; so i mentioned the idea here in the zenoss center of excellence (heh) - they liked the idea of deprecating select ZenPacks<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:10:33] &lt;nyeates&gt; but didnt think there could ever be "too many" zenpacks<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:13:29] &lt;nyeates&gt; Jane, understood on the contrib agreement.

explain dave, not sure what thta means<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:26:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm just getting started with git, but there seems to be a concept something like SVN's "external", and there are (mostly perl) tools to use a gateway between SVN and Git as that external<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:26:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; so in a sense your local Git repo acts as a client to the SVN repot, and can check out and in.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:26:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; But that's well beyond my skill level right now.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:27:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; I have tried to import the Core SVN repo into Git but there is some inconsistency in the SVN archive that blows up the conversion<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:27:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; I wish I could get some tips from one of your devs who uses Git for the core<br/>[21-Dec-2010 12:28:04] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt;

yeh, there's the new VMWare ESXi pack that Eric Enns made, which uses the vSphere API to monitor ESX, ESXi, and vSphere<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:08:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; but when I query my vSphere server I get zero host info<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:08:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; yet I get the info when I query my ESX servers directly<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:08:33] &lt;braynyac&gt; ok, I'm querying the hosts directly<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:08:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; that should be working<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:08:47] &lt;braynyac&gt; not the vsphere, as I couldn't get that to work, and there are only 3 of them<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:08:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; you may want to try our Eric Enn's pack instead<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:08:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's very good<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:09:06] &lt;braynyac&gt; yeah, I can add additional data points the the already defined data sources, but no new data sources<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:09:11] &lt;braynyac&gt; OK, I'm taking a look now<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:09:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh also, in Eric's pack, the devices need to be named the same as the hostname of the device<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:09:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; if they don't match it won't collect the info properly<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:09:54] &lt;braynyac&gt; ok<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:10:32] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: do they get put in as soon as received?&#160; I don't see my syslog entries showing up.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:10:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; braynyac: docs/DOC-10242<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:10:51] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: also, how does it know what syslog entries relate to which device?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:10:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; braynyac: docs/DOC-10225<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:10:54] &lt;Simon4&gt; axelilly: yeah, they should be<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:11:04] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: is there a way to debug it?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:11:04] &lt;Simon4&gt; axelilly: the source ip from the syslog udp packet<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:11:10] &lt;braynyac&gt; rmatte: already at the 10225 =)<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:11:29] &lt;braynyac&gt; rmatte: can I add additional data points if needed?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:11:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; braynyac: k, you need 10242 installed as a pre-requisite<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:11:39] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: do I have to enable syslog receiving in Zenoss?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:11:54] &lt;Simon4&gt; axelilly: so long as zensyslog is running you should be fine<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:12:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; check $ZENHOME/logs/zensyslog.log<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:12:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; braynyac: well, he uses a custom perl script to collect the info, you can try but it's not simple to do.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:12:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; braynyac: He's adding support for interfaces, LUNs, etc... soon<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:12:58] &lt;braynyac&gt; rmatte: that kinda stinks...k<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:13:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; braynyac: Zenoss Core had zero VMWare monitoring support a few months ago, just be happy that there's anything available lol<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:13:29] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: file doesn't exist<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:13:30] &lt;braynyac&gt; rmatte: that was one of the reasons I like the esxtop script, it *should* be able to grab just about anything esxtop can see<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:13:44] &lt;braynyac&gt; rmatte: Indeed I am!&#160; Very Very Very happy!<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:13:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; braynyac: yeh, it should, I don't know where you'd be going wrong with that one<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:14:02] &lt;braynyac&gt; k<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:14:03] &lt;Simon4&gt; axelilly: sorry, $ZENHOME/log<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:14:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never tried the esxtop pack<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:14:05] &lt;Simon4&gt; not logs<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:14:30] &lt;braynyac&gt; rmatte: it's pretty slick, as long as you understand what the values mean<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:14:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:15:16] &lt;braynyac&gt; rmatte: the data in the zenpack you recommended is EXACTLY the data I'm trying to get esxtop to return<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:15:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's pretty good data<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:15:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; Eric's been using the enterprise vmware pack as a guideline of what to include<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:16:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; though it doesn't share any code with the enterprise pack obviously<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:16:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:16:46] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: looks like it's running, but it's not seeing any syslog activity.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:16:51] &lt;braynyac&gt; rmatte: Nice!&#160; that's the way to do it - build off someone else's hard work <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:17:04] &lt;rmatte&gt;

rmatte: Thanks a ton for the help, I'm working on installing it now.&#160; Hopefully between the two, I'll get the data I'm looking for =)<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:21:24] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: I fixed it....duh, forgot to allow UDP 514 inbound in the zenoss firewall<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:21:36] &lt;Simon4&gt; axelilly: excellent <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:22:40] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: so what severity level do you usually send in from network devices?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:23:23] &lt;Simon4&gt; axelilly: I've found that the severity that cisco syslogs at isn't too bad, and we event transform anything that we don't agree with at the zenoss end<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:24:03] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: yea, I mean though what trap level do you set on the cisco device to send over to zenoss?&#160; Informational, debug?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:24:32] &lt;Simon4&gt; ah, lemme check<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:24:56] &lt;Simon4&gt; logging trap notifications<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:25:32] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: cool<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:31:04] &lt;braynyac&gt; what are the new features / benefits of Avalon over 3?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:33:49] &lt;braynyac&gt; rmatte: do the devices need to be named the FQDN, or just the NETBIOS name?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:34:52] &lt;nyeates&gt; braynyac: see our blog for a entry about product roadmap that explains some of what avalon has in store<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:35:13] &lt;braynyac&gt; nyeates: will do!&#160; Thanks =)<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:35:49] &lt;nyeates&gt; additional roadmap blogs are planned to be released.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:36:17] &lt;nyeates&gt; ZEC is a huge avalon plus - event processing that will be much more scalable and easier to handle<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:38:03] &lt;nyeates&gt; appologies, its not called ZEC....but there are currently planned to be many updates to the event processing architecture<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:41:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; meh, really wish zenoss wasnt such a resource hog<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:42:21] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: strange, I set IOS to log all commands, but they never show up in zenoss.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:42:25] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its not playing well on this vm cluster...<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:42:54] &lt;Simon4&gt; axelilly: are they logging on the device?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:43:03] &lt;Simon4&gt; Sam-I-Am: memory and IO<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:43:22] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; Simon4: yeah, mainly<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:43:23] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: yea, as severity 5<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:43:36] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: does zenoss filter out log lines?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:43:39] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; when the collection runs the thing more or less grinds to a halt<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:43:42] &lt;Simon4&gt; axelilly: not that I know of<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:43:45] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; and this is not a small box<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:43:47] &lt;Simon4&gt; Sam-I-Am: how many devices?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:43:49] &lt;axelilly&gt;

and what size is your vm?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:44:29] &lt;nyeates&gt; i think there is a perfomance tips guide out there....lemme dig it up<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:44:50] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its not that bad<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:44:55] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; Simon4: size of what part?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:45:15] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: do you have archive turned on?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:45:47] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmm, iowait is hitting 100%<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:45:49] &lt;Simon4&gt; axelilly: I don't believe so, and I don't log all commands<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:46:31] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: it looks like zenoss might be filtering syslog data.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:46:37] &lt;nyeates&gt;

I have boxes with raid-1 collecting for hundreds of devices that hit about 30% iowait and it worries me<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:48:03] &lt;Simon4&gt; 100% is def something to worry about<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:48:27] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; guess i'll go poke the sysadmin <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:48:32] &lt;nyeates&gt; you will want to look at your storage specifics....i think that there are contention and qos storage settings in VM that you may be able to mess with<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:48:46] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; nyeates: yeah, i think that might be the ticket here.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:48:56] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; it was just weird to see an issue with only 30 devices<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:49:09] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ram is not an issue, which is good.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:49:14] &lt;nyeates&gt;

lol<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:57:08] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: it looks like if zenoss receives a syslog entry that it doesn't have a map for, it just throws it away.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:57:31] &lt;Simon4&gt; axelilly: nahh, it should be filing it in /Unknown but still tagged to the device that sent it<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:57:59] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: my zenoss is just eating them.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 14:58:13] &lt;axelilly&gt;

yeah, anything we haven't mapped<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:01:36] &lt;axelilly&gt; man, what's going on?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:02:03] &lt;Simon4&gt; I would be double checking my kit to make sure it's actually sending the messages, or maybe getting tcpdump out on the zenoss box interface to see whether a) it's sending them or b) they're getting to the box<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:02:21] &lt;axelilly&gt; good idea on tcpdump, trying that out<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:10:17] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: yes, just verified via tcpdump that zenoss receives the syslog message<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:10:28] &lt;axelilly&gt; Simon4: however, it never shows up anywhere in zenoss<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:10:44] &lt;Simon4&gt; axelilly: wierd :/<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:11:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: what level is the syslog?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:11:40] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Simon4: that's true, I'm just not sure if zenbatchload is calling zendisc exclusively, or if it is calling zenmodel directly<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:35:15] &lt;Simon4&gt; npmccallum: yeah, I've never used zenbatchload, I've just scripted zendisc<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:35:39] &lt;npmccallum&gt; same here<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:36:02] &lt;mray&gt; I'll let you know what I find when I find out <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:36:39] &lt;mray&gt; so far I've got the server installing, putting in a couple zenpacks and putting the pubkey on the clients so they can be monitored via SSH<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:38:22] &lt;mray&gt; next will be adding devices, I just want to make sure I don't DOS the zenoss server if someone were to add 500 devices at the same time. zenbatchload solves that, but I don't want to remodel everything everytime<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:39:25] &lt;rocket&gt; zenbatchload is slow though matt ..<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:39:43] &lt;rocket&gt; especially if you are planning on just appending to the batch loading file etc<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:40:04] &lt;Simon4&gt; mray: wouldn't you have a device register itself when it's built/configured via chef?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:40:11] &lt;mray&gt; Simon4: yes<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:40:35] &lt;mray&gt; Simon4: and the server will build it's zenbatchload list on a chef-client run<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:40:38] &lt;mray&gt; via search<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:41:07] &lt;mray&gt; find any devices to be monitored, using Roles for their Device Class and Systems<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:41:28] &lt;rocket&gt; I guess I would do two things ... a small zendmd snippet that gets the list of devices and dump that to a file<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:41:30] &lt;mray&gt; so attributes on the Roles will map to zProperties<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:41:52] &lt;rocket&gt; and then compare new to old and only add the new ones via zenbatchload<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:42:02] &lt;mray&gt; rocket: hmmm&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; interesting idea<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:42:14] &lt;mray&gt; but how does that handle remodeling based on changes?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:42:27] &lt;mray&gt; like if a box is no longer providing a particular application?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:42:46] &lt;Simon4&gt; mray: so you want the chef run to trigger a model anyway?<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:42:55] &lt;Simon4&gt; (if something happens)<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:43:00] &lt;mray&gt; No, I only want to model if something changes<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:43:09] &lt;mray&gt; so obviously "New"<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:43:30] &lt;rocket&gt; mray: if chef did work update a file that says "I changed" have zenoss remodel.<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:44:07] &lt;mray&gt; yeah, I may end up with something like that<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:44:15] &lt;rocket&gt;

mray: I would put in a defect if the api cant handle batch loading of devices in a sane way<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:46:24] &lt;mray&gt; rocket: there probably is a call for doing a batch, but my problem is each device will be checking itself in<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:46:35] &lt;rocket&gt; mray: I would look at using the json side if at all possible .. you know as well as I the changes happening inside right now<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:46:53] &lt;Simon4&gt; mray: possibly use hte zenjobs api (if there is one?)<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:47:02] &lt;Simon4&gt; v3 seems to use that for adding/modelling devices<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:47:10] &lt;mray&gt; Simon4: I haven't seen that listed in the JSON API<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:47:12] &lt;Simon4&gt; it might go a way to queue tasks vs DOS'ing things<br/>[21-Dec-2010 15:47:24] &lt;Simon4&gt;

I think they each run on their own time<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:38:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I could be wrong though<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:38:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; If their run times are controlled by the master then you're out of luck (which I suspect it is)<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:39:06] &lt;nyeates&gt; hmmmm<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:40:56] &lt;nyeates&gt; yeah starting them at different times is probly best<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:41:04] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; not sure... almost seems they run at their intervals based on startup<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:41:08] &lt;nyeates&gt; i was thinking of modeling....you can set modeling to occur at certain times<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:41:10] &lt;nyeates&gt; by using cron<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:41:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah, i'll probably need to do that too<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:41:26] &lt;nyeates&gt; huh?<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:41:39] &lt;nyeates&gt; no modeling is what runs every 12 hrs (default)<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:41:44] &lt;nyeates&gt; u can set that more easily<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:41:49] &lt;nyeates&gt; collection is different tho<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:42:29] &lt;nyeates&gt; im actually not too sure on the details of it...someone here though said that starting the collectors at different times was best<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:44:16] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i was saying i need to change modeling too i think<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:44:24] &lt;nyeates&gt; oh cool...missed that<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:44:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh ok... someone who is good in perl<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:44:39] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yay confusion<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:44:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; how would I replace \ with \\ in a string?<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:44:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's driving me nuts<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:45:08] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; /\\/\\\\/ ?<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:45:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've tried "s/\/\\/g" I've tried "s/\\/\\\\/g"<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:45:24] &lt;ericenns_&gt; rmatte: I have done just that let me look<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:45:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; thanks<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:45:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; should just need to escape each \ , but perl can be weird<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:46:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: well, when I try to escape each \ in sed it barfs lol<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:46:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; so perl is probably doing something similar<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:46:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; rmatte@noc:~$ echo "C:\blah" | sed "s/\\/\\\\/g"<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:46:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; sed: -e expression #1, char 8: unterminated `s' command<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:46:42] &lt;rocket&gt;

hmmm, it must not like the double quotes<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:50:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll try single quotes and see if that makes a difference<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:51:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; nope, that didn't help<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:52:02] &lt;ericenns_&gt; rmatte: did you try my command<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:53:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, and it works<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:53:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I need to get it working in perl<br/>[22-Dec-2010 14:53:07] &lt;rmatte&gt;

ok, now for the moment of truth, this had better work<br/>[22-Dec-2010 15:02:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; nyeates: well, probably everything in a certain range of IPs<br/>[22-Dec-2010 15:02:22] &lt;nyeates&gt; if its a range of hosts like 192.168.0.1-400.... i imagin there has to be a better single call<br/>[22-Dec-2010 15:02:52] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the key is being able to add them to the appropriate collector first shot<br/>[22-Dec-2010 15:03:03] &lt;nyeates&gt;

so... the hub does not need to see the device i'm adding to a collector somewhere else, right?<br/>[22-Dec-2010 15:24:30] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; in other words, the hub does not have direct IP access to the device<br/>[22-Dec-2010 15:24:47] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

it's nice to keep a second page in case anyone wants to reference old packs for development reasons<br/>[23-Dec-2010 10:26:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; but there's no reason to have them on the main ZenPack page<br/>[23-Dec-2010 10:27:17] &lt;nyeates&gt;

I don't have a lot of events being generated, though.<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:27:05] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, I'm def interested in the results of that<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:27:16] &lt;Simon4&gt; _theoretically_ (and they'll tell you this) it'll be fine<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:27:20] &lt;davetoo&gt;

yeah, the title is a bit misleading, it's the same issue for NAT or any other url misdirection<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:29:52] &lt;Simon4&gt; basically if your clients can't see the collectors by the same URL that your hub does<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:30:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; right<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:30:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; $client is also wishes that if a datacenter is down, he could look at the RRD files from the collector in that datacenter to help with diagnostics.<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:31:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; I don't know if there's any solution to that.<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:31:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; i.e. duplicate the RRD files elsewhere and be able to use them easily.<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:31:27] &lt;Simon4&gt; other than shipping rrd files, not an easy one that I know of<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:31:38] &lt;Simon4&gt; our initial install was a single hub + collector<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:31:56] &lt;Simon4&gt; and we shipped the rrd files from collector-&gt; hub, and set the render url to http://hub for all collectors<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:32:00] &lt;Simon4&gt; that works just fine<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:32:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; interesting<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:32:22] &lt;Simon4&gt; but the disk IO load for rsyncing a heap of rrd files whilst also updating them gets very high very fast<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:32:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes indeed<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:32:43] &lt;Simon4&gt; if you have a read of the source files I've edited you'll get the idea for how the render url works fairly quickly<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:32:56] &lt;Simon4&gt; it's not too complex, and opens itself up to all sorts of fun and games<br/>[28-Dec-2010 15:33:04] &lt;davetoo&gt;

so if you're proxying via httpd anyway, you can bypass that and have httpd talk direct to zenrender on the collector<br/>[29-Dec-2010 15:04:45] &lt;Simon4&gt; keeps the zenhub free to do zenhub type things<br/>[29-Dec-2010 15:05:16] &lt;davetoo&gt;

hah<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:21:32] &lt;kokey&gt; poof gone another gig of RAM<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:22:08] &lt;kokey&gt; davetoo: now that gives me a nice idea<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:22:18] &lt;kokey&gt; thing is with zenoss is that multi graph reports and the interface for it is poo<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:22:30] &lt;kokey&gt; it's nothing like graphite or circonus or any of those<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:22:33] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:22:34] &lt;kokey&gt; or even like the thing i wrote<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:22:46] * davetoo makes a note to go figure out what circonus is<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:22:53] &lt;kokey&gt; i could maybe use my code to work on the zenoss RRD graphs<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:23:13] &lt;kokey&gt; circonus... actually look at the reconnoiter demo video<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:23:15] &lt;kokey&gt; it's the same thing<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:23:15] &lt;mray&gt; davetoo: it's a monitoring SAAS<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:23:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; ah<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:23:26] &lt;kokey&gt; lovely interface for selecting graphs and applying functions on them and saving them for later<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:23:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; I wish I were more of a developer <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:24:18] &lt;kokey&gt; that's maybe what's wrong with my current contract<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:24:20] &lt;kokey&gt; i probably miss coding<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:24:30] &lt;kokey&gt; i'm actually going out of my way to avoid coding anything since i know i'm leaving<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:24:36] &lt;kokey&gt; i don't want to leave them with custom stuff to maintain<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:24:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; I have some ideas about shoving RRD data into matplotlib for graphing but I don't have much UI experience.<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:24:57] &lt;kokey&gt; that's why i pushed for zenoss and try to figure out how to do things as standard as possible with the features built in<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:25:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; kokey: how are you with python?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:25:18] &lt;kokey&gt; davetoo: it's strange that many of the monitoring stuff doesn't get graph interfaces right<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:25:28] &lt;kokey&gt; i'm a bit crap with python at the moment<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:25:32] &lt;kokey&gt; actually it's funny<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:25:44] &lt;kokey&gt; i figured this project will at least get my python skills up to scratch<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:25:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; would you believe: as far as I can tell, Zenoss began life as a configuration management tool <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:25:49] &lt;mray&gt; davetoo: I think Simon4 had some external graphing stuff going on<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:25:49] &lt;kokey&gt; but i scared myself a bit<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; mray: you know anything about the early CM genesis of Zenoss?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:09] &lt;kokey&gt; i thought my first task to do with python was to use the twisted libs that ships with zenoss to do some automated ssh login stuff for me<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:13] &lt;kokey&gt; what a huge bloody mistake<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:19] &lt;mray&gt; davetoo: pretty sure it was always monitoring<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; Wasnt one of it's first names "zenconfmon?"<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; or "confmon"?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:27] &lt;mray&gt; "zentinel"<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:29] &lt;kokey&gt; using twisted with multiple connections is no way to start out on python<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; maybe he borrowed code from a different project of his<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:38] &lt;kokey&gt; it scared me so much that i'm put off python for a while<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:26:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; yeah, twisted confuses me still<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:27:09] &lt;mray&gt; it was written because Nagios was a pain to configure<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:27:11] &lt;kokey&gt; it's fine if you launch it once, let it do one thing, and then exit the script completely<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:27:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; but you shouldn't have to get that far down<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:27:24] &lt;mray&gt; and didn't scale very far at the time<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:27:37] &lt;mray&gt; the use of Zope gave the inheritance and object model<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:27:37] &lt;kokey&gt; i think i managed to break all the nagios scaling records<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:27:43] &lt;kokey&gt; and it also taught me to dislike nagios<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:27:50] &lt;kokey&gt; probably why i appreciate zenoss so much now<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:28:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; anyway, kokey, install ipython as the zenoss user (in the zenoss private python install) and it will make interactive zendmd *soooo* much more useful<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:28:07] &lt;mray&gt; I think the more they continue to abstract away from Zope, the better<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:28:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; very good to learn about the code<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:28:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; mray: *nod*<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:28:47] &lt;kokey&gt; i'm going to be doing some integration work between zenoss and infoblox<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:28:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; mray: at the least, the more they move away from Zope 2-isms<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:28:59] &lt;mray&gt; infoblox?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:29:01] &lt;kokey&gt; and want to write one portlet<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:29:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; kokey: hah<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:29:10] &lt;kokey&gt; infoblox is a DNS and IP management thing<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:29:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; kokey: let me know how that goes;<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:29:31] &lt;mray&gt; kokey: interesting<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:29:41] &lt;mray&gt; my Chef deployment of Zenoss is going very well<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:30:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; mray: too bad Chef is Ruby <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:30:03] &lt;mray&gt; I've got device classes, locations and groups working<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:30:40] &lt;mray&gt; davetoo: meh, I've been around the block enough not to be a language bigot.<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:30:53] &lt;mray&gt; my resume had 14 languages at 1 point, now I just say "lately"<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:31:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; mray: it's just that I don't know Ruby <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:31:34] &lt;mray&gt; davetoo: it's nice, it's come a long way since I started with it 3 years ago<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:31:48] &lt;mray&gt; I think there's a perfect language somewhere between Python and Ruby<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:32:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; Zenoss is the reason I put Ruby on hold and learned Python.<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:32:32] &lt;mray&gt; yeah, but Zenoss make Python look bad because it uses Zope<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:33:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; that's what I've heard <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:34:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; erik did briefly entertain moving to Django <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:35:10] &lt;mray&gt; yeah, development is slowly removing the zope stuff piecemeal<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:35:26] &lt;mray&gt; Avalon is going to be a big change<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:35:38] &lt;mray&gt; with more java in the mix<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:37:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; mray: I fired up trunk yesterday.&#160; The UI didn't work, but I managed to get my RabbitMQ config working.<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:37:41] &lt;kokey&gt; ooh<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:37:44] &lt;kokey&gt; rabbitmq?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:37:51] &lt;kokey&gt; what is that going to be used for?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:37:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes; they're reworking the Events system<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:38:15] &lt;kokey&gt; rabbitmq then just used internally?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:38:29] &lt;kokey&gt; or it going to be catching messages with it from elsewhere?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:38:29] &lt;davetoo&gt; kokey: from what I can tell, the major impetus was for comms between the new Java stuff and the python/zope stuff<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:38:40] &lt;kokey&gt; ah ok<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:38:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; but it will also be able to farm out events to other daemons/boxes<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:38:45] &lt;kokey&gt; what new java stuff?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:39:08] &lt;mray&gt; the event subsystem is getting rewritten in java<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:39:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; most of the new java stuff seems to be for Enterprise; they have some new dependency management stuff<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:39:20] &lt;kokey&gt; ah ok<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:39:24] &lt;kokey&gt; shame that it's in java<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:39:38] &lt;kokey&gt; but then again zope can also be a pain<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:39:50] &lt;mray&gt; that's been the usual reaction, but supposedly the performance gains are an order of magnitude<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:39:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; some of that is because they seem to have found that the yfiles library is a good fit for directed-graph stuff they want to do<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:40:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; ah<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:40:11] &lt;kokey&gt; yeah my first thought was that there will be performance gains<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:40:14] &lt;mray&gt; last I heard they were using Neo4J<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:40:20] &lt;kokey&gt; i'm a bit strange<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:40:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh!<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:40:22] &lt;mray&gt; for the graph DB<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:40:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; even better<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:40:47] &lt;kokey&gt; i like to do stuff in perl, because most of the time it performs as fast as other people's java stuff and for a fraction of the size of deployment or memory usage<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:40:49] &lt;davetoo&gt; I need to learn Java<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:41:27] &lt;kokey&gt; i think i have a resistence to languages i can't do on a dev server with vi<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:41:35] &lt;kokey&gt; where it only works nicely with some IDE on a desktop<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:41:40] &lt;kokey&gt; i don't like anything on a desktop<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:41:57] &lt;kokey&gt; i mean you can do java with vi<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:41:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; grrrr, our analysts here drive me nuts sometimes<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:00] &lt;kokey&gt; or vim<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:04] &lt;kokey&gt; but it's painful<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; They use the term "trap" for everything<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; Smalltalk? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:15] &lt;kokey&gt; rmatte: haha<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I get a call last night "There's a memory trap that came in"... I come in this morning and it's a Zenoss threshold that kicked off<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:28] &lt;kokey&gt; i can't wait until the previous monitoring guy has left<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:31] &lt;kokey&gt; one more month<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:43] &lt;kokey&gt; because his idea of monitoring is to have everything be sent out as traps<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; I use Eclipse with Pydev because the class browsers and folding editors help my less-than-seven-item short-term memory<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:50] &lt;kokey&gt; and make custom traps for everything too<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:42:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I try to use traps as little as possible<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:43:03] &lt;kokey&gt; i like to use traps as little as possible<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:43:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; I use them for stuff like eigrp, bgp alerts<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:43:08] &lt;kokey&gt; *5*<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:43:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; and environmental alerts<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:43:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; problem with traps is, they're UDP<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:43:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; exactly<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:43:46] &lt;kokey&gt; davetoo: yeah i might have to do something like that<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:43:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is why I do all my interface monitoring through snmp polling<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:43:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; much more effective<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:44:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus interface traps change from device to device<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:44:09] &lt;kokey&gt; actually perhaps python might be a good way for me to get the hang of using eclipse on stuff i want to deploy and test on servers<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:44:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; pain in the ass to customize it for each type<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:44:25] &lt;kokey&gt; i've always had that pain on java, write some stuff in eclipse and don't know how to deploy it elsewhere<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:44:57] &lt;kokey&gt; the guy who is leaving used systemedge on all the systems<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:45:04] &lt;kokey&gt; it is not bad, and has a MIB i just load<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:45:15] &lt;kokey&gt; but he's obviously got a big config doing lots of stuff<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:45:22] &lt;kokey&gt; and it's spitting out traps like mad<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:45:34] &lt;kokey&gt; they make some sense but there are so many that everyone just ignores it<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:46:05] &lt;kokey&gt; one of the first transforms i did on zenoss<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:46:15] &lt;kokey&gt; if it's from the sysedge oid tree, send to history ;-)<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:53:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:54:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; yeah, speaking of Java, you need Maven (and RabbitMQ &gt;= 1.8) to build/install trunk<br/>[30-Dec-2010 11:55:44] &lt;joko&gt; hmmmm<br/>[30-Dec-2010 12:01:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; kokey: have you used rabbitmq?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 12:03:20] &lt;kokey&gt; nope not really<br/>[30-Dec-2010 12:03:29] &lt;kokey&gt; but been looking into it and things like activemq<br/>[30-Dec-2010 12:03:37] &lt;kokey&gt; i'm fond of the concept<br/>[30-Dec-2010 12:04:17] &lt;kokey&gt; ok, sneak off home early time<br/>[30-Dec-2010 12:04:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; Apparently the AMQP 1.0 spec gets rid of a lot of the stuff that looks interesting (to me) in 0.9.1<br/>[30-Dec-2010 12:04:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok have a safe weekend<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:00:52] &lt;LarsN&gt; Hello All!&#160; Happy Newyear!&#160; (Nearly)<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:01:24] &lt;LarsN&gt; I don't suppose any of you know of a working on Zenoss 3.0.x AIX zenpack?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:01:58] &lt;LarsN&gt; stripping the py-2.4 extension from the zenpack listed on the site doesn't work.&#160; I found another AIX 1.1 for Py-2.6 that I installed but it also fails to show up in the list of loaded zenpacks.<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:03:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; after you loaded that did you restart zenoss?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:04:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; I haven't had any AIX systems to monitor in 3.0.x, though<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:05:21] &lt;LarsN&gt; davetoo: I did, although I'm not opposed to removing the one that's there, restarting, re-installing, and restarting again.<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:05:27] &lt;LarsN&gt; let me try that and see if it helps<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:05:43] &lt;davetoo&gt; that sounds like a good idea<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:08:01] &lt;LarsN&gt; where does zenoss drop logs relating to zenpack installation?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:08:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; darn good question<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:08:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; and I don't know the answer; are you using the shell/cli app or the UI?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:10:03] &lt;LarsN&gt; we installed via the UI<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:10:15] &lt;LarsN&gt; I suppose I could try installing via the cli.<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:10:20] &lt;LarsN&gt; that would likely tell me if it errors<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:10:41] &lt;davetoo&gt; the 'zenpack' command.&#160; I don't know if you can change the verbosity or not.<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:10:57] &lt;LarsN&gt; if this test fails<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:10:59] &lt;LarsN&gt; I'll try that.<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:19:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; LarsN: installing via the UI is crap, always install ZenPacks via CLI<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:20:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; and there is no log file for ZenPack install info<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:20:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's output while installing the pack<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:20:33] &lt;davetoo&gt; does zenpack --install take a -vnn setting?<br/>[30-Dec-2010 15:24:54] &lt;LarsN&gt;

i'm throwing a party at our house<br/>[31-Dec-2010 07:18:12] &lt;kokey&gt; though i still have to spend more time getting used to the serato setup<br/>[31-Dec-2010 07:56:20] &lt;kokey&gt; ok now going to have to do a bit of dancing with other vendors to get quotes for comparison with zenoss enterprise<br/>[31-Dec-2010 07:56:39] &lt;kokey&gt; we need 3 quotes etc.<br/>[31-Dec-2010 07:57:08] &lt;kokey&gt; from my memory zenoss was still way better value feature wise than stuff like hyperic<br/>[31-Dec-2010 07:57:12] &lt;kokey&gt; and cheaper<br/>[31-Dec-2010 07:57:20] &lt;kokey&gt; and certainly cheaper than the HP/IBM stuff<br/>[31-Dec-2010 10:06:36] * Simon4 opens a beer<br/>[31-Dec-2010 10:55:53] &lt;kokey&gt; hehe<br/>[31-Dec-2010 10:55:54] &lt;kokey&gt; nice<br/>[31-Dec-2010 10:56:00] &lt;kokey&gt;

oh and behringer bcd3000 and a little hercules i've taken on travels<br/>[31-Dec-2010 10:59:03] &lt;Simon4&gt; cool<br/>[31-Dec-2010 10:59:11] &lt;kokey&gt; at the house we have two technics SLs, and two CDJ1000 mk3s<br/>[31-Dec-2010 10:59:20] &lt;Simon4&gt; hah awesome<br/>[31-Dec-2010 10:59:44] &lt;kokey&gt; and the serato scratch rane thing<br/>[31-Dec-2010 10:59:54] &lt;Simon4&gt; I haven't let myself buy vinyl over here int he UK<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:00:04] &lt;kokey&gt; my housemate likes serato, i'm more of a traktor person<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:00:10] &lt;Simon4&gt; it would end badly, with a large containerful of it ending up being shipped back to NZ<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:00:17] &lt;kokey&gt; he's away, fortunately the serato software is free so i've been playing with it<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:00:23] &lt;kokey&gt; hehe, yeah<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:00:32] &lt;kokey&gt; vinyl is a mission really<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:00:41] &lt;kokey&gt; i was playing on the SLs after xmas getting the hang of them<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:00:42] &lt;Simon4&gt; still my fav thing to mix on but<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:01:00] &lt;kokey&gt; and going through the vinyl at home trying to sort it in useful ways<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:01:16] &lt;kokey&gt; actually there's two things that annoy me<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:01:30] &lt;kokey&gt; the main thing really is how much time it takes to dig through vinyl, find stuff, try it out, and move on<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:01:41] &lt;kokey&gt; with digital you can read through a list and preview tracks<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:01:45] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, you have to know your tunes for sure<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:01:56] &lt;kokey&gt; yeah with someone else's collection it's a mission<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:02:14] &lt;kokey&gt; well on digital it's bad too but at least you can preview to make sure it's not utter nonsense<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:02:22] &lt;kokey&gt; and on digital you can have your music on a usb key<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:02:39] &lt;kokey&gt; so you can actually have it with you if you need to take over from someone<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:02:57] &lt;Simon4&gt; ah.. the future <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:03:05] &lt;kokey&gt; the other issue really is that i've been getting used to all sorts of fun things i can do with the sync locked<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:03:12] &lt;kokey&gt; things you can't really do with turntables<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:03:30] * Simon4 has somewhat fond memories of lugging flight cases of vinyl across fields for outdoor gigs<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:04:12] &lt;kokey&gt; a friend of mine, a bit of a nutter collector, would take 3500 CDs with him if he's playing some gigs a few times on a weekend festival<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:04:18] &lt;kokey&gt; 3500 CDs are heavy<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:04:23] &lt;Simon4&gt; thats quite mental<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:04:39] &lt;kokey&gt; the guy is quite strange, had 45000 albums at that stage<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:04:45] &lt;kokey&gt; 13,000 of them were CD<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:04:49] &lt;kokey&gt; the rest vinyl<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:05:01] &lt;kokey&gt; not sure if he's still doing it last i checked he was more into trading books<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:05:09] &lt;kokey&gt; and just collecting MP3s<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:05:24] &lt;kokey&gt; and he's back in south africa<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:05:41] &lt;kokey&gt; would come to the UK every year or two over january and would just shop full time for a month for second hand stuff<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:05:50] &lt;kokey&gt; and ship like 300kg of stuff back afterwards<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:06:11] &lt;Simon4&gt; youch<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:06:20] &lt;Simon4&gt; I see full collections fly past on gumtree occasionally<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:06:22] &lt;kokey&gt; though he would buy CDs, take them out of their cases, and put them into those big CD bags<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:06:32] &lt;Simon4&gt; so tempting to pick one up and cherry pick stuff out of it<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:06:33] &lt;kokey&gt; and take those on the plane<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:06:39] &lt;kokey&gt; and carry them past customs<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:06:54] &lt;kokey&gt; i like buying my digital music<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:07:12] &lt;kokey&gt; like if i do get to play regularly i will have one evening of the week listening to new releases and pick some and buy them<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:07:34] &lt;Simon4&gt; in nz we had a record shop over the road from one of our local bars<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:07:35] &lt;kokey&gt; and another night i'll DJ to myself for a bit to get the hang of them<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:07:38] &lt;Simon4&gt; wed night was new tune night<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:07:49] &lt;kokey&gt; then i know my tracks by the weekend<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:08:05] &lt;kokey&gt; so i wouldn't sit with a gazillion tracks downloaded from the interwebs that i don't know well<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:08:15] &lt;Simon4&gt; it's a good plan<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:08:23] &lt;kokey&gt; except i have one problem now<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:08:35] &lt;kokey&gt; with traktor it lists the tracks with a little edge like the side of an album cover<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:08:47] &lt;kokey&gt; so you get to remember them by picture and the names doesn't always stick so well<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:09:10] &lt;Simon4&gt; heh, I do that with vinyl covers/labels, vs the names<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:09:17] &lt;kokey&gt; then when they're just a list of names in serato i don't always remember what they are until i've played them for a second<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:09:49] &lt;kokey&gt; it's too easy to buy vinyl for me if i wanted to since i live right by brick lane<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:09:56] &lt;kokey&gt; good thing i won't<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:10:20] &lt;Simon4&gt; I just know how much it hurts to move house with more than about 4 crates of vinyl<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:11:17] &lt;kokey&gt; just one box is too much weight for me<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:11:34] &lt;kokey&gt; gosh i even got tired of carrying the bcd3000 around which is lighter than the omni kontrol<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:11:55] &lt;Simon4&gt; a 16GB usb stick must be way more than a crate of vinyl these days I guess<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:12:25] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, if mp3 it's stupidly more<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:12:30] &lt;Simon4&gt; ze world has changed<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:12:40] &lt;kokey&gt; i think my entire collection is still way smaller than 16GB<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:16:07] &lt;kokey&gt; what area do you stay in?<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:16:19] &lt;Simon4&gt; I'm living out in ealing broadway these days<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:16:31] &lt;kokey&gt; goodness a lot of people out that way that i know lately<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:16:38] &lt;kokey&gt; i never knew any people that way before<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:16:41] &lt;Simon4&gt; heh<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:16:50] &lt;Simon4&gt; I was living in bethnal green before, fun place to be<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:16:55] &lt;kokey&gt; but now as i move back i keep on bumping into people from there<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:17:05] &lt;kokey&gt; yeah i'm living right on the bethnal green/shoreditch border<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:17:09] &lt;kokey&gt; cheshire street<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:17:15] &lt;kokey&gt; above beyond retro<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:17:21] &lt;Simon4&gt; ah nice<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:17:41] &lt;kokey&gt; dangerous place to live in<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:17:48] &lt;kokey&gt; won't be good for my health long term<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:24:05] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, I go out a bunch less living here<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:24:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; getting old <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/shocked.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:26:38] &lt;kokey&gt; i don't even have to leave the building for it to be dangerous a lot of the time<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:26:47] &lt;kokey&gt; we have fun neighbours<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:27:15] &lt;Simon4&gt; hah awesome<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:28:52] * Simon4 is well in need of a decent night out, i must see what's on in Jan<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:40:12] &lt;kokey&gt; and here i am thinking i should try take it as easy as possible in jan<br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:40:27] &lt;Simon4&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[31-Dec-2010 11:40:30] &lt;kokey&gt;

but the observations are totally correct<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:28:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; I almost always install from source but I'm working with RPM installs right now so was searching for issues<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:28:18] &lt;Simon4&gt; we install from rpm via puppet<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:28:35] &lt;Simon4&gt; the only thing we change though is we add the zenoss user with a custom uid/gid before the rpm install<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:28:39] &lt;Simon4&gt; which doesn't break it<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:28:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; no? it's smart about that?<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:29:10] &lt;Simon4&gt; it seems to happily work with an existing user<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:29:18] &lt;Simon4&gt; even with a different uid<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:29:29] &lt;Simon4&gt; this was a relief to me a month or 4 back <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:29:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; When you do that, does it then not delete that user when you uninstall the RPM?<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:29:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; like it does normally<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:30:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; I don't have an rpm-using system here at home to test with.&#160; But that would make things easier.<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:30:39] &lt;Simon4&gt; probably, I haven't tried - if someone's manually uninstalling rpm's off our systems they deserve anything they get<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:30:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; I would like to have the zenoss homedir all set up beforehand.<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:30:59] &lt;Simon4&gt; so I set up the user, homedir and a bunch of scripts in the homedir, then install the rpm<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:31:03] &lt;Simon4&gt; works fine<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:31:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; cool<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:31:49] &lt;Simon4&gt; I'm still considering stripping their SRPM so it doesn't run the postinst bullshit though<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:31:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; yeah we need to get the ssh configs out there, and I have some tools I want to install ...<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:32:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; yeah, I don't like that it greps the hostfile for 'localhost'<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:32:14] &lt;Simon4&gt; i.e. for collectors you could have a stripped version tht doesn't fire up/config mysql or snmpd or the rest of the world<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:32:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; exactly<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:32:37] &lt;davetoo&gt; don't need the remote collector to spend five minutes building the zodb<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:32:58] &lt;Simon4&gt; or configuring mysql if you are running a big install with remote mysql<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:33:06] * Simon4 has to get puppet to neuter that stuff afterwards<br/>[31-Dec-2010 17:34:16] &lt;davetoo&gt;
