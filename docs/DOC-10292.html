k<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:02:24] &lt;jb&gt; but you only do that every 5 minutes/<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:02:25] &lt;jb&gt; ?<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:02:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:02:39] &lt;jb&gt; yeah, i'd like to rely on traps for that<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:02:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; but the ifLastChange polls detect anything that occured between polls<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:02:43] &lt;jb&gt; so its more realtime..<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:03:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; and we can afford to wait 5 minutes since we're going to end up spending 10+ minutes on the phone with the carrier anyways<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:03:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's not the end of the world<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:03:36] &lt;rmatte&gt;

the information is there, i just need to do stuff with it<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:10:24] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; theres always something mo' bettah i can do... just a matter of finding time for it<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:11:25] &lt;jb&gt;

no<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:13:17] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; well, not necessarily<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:13:27] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; it will trap if you remove the link from an enabled port<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:13:39] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

well, i guess if there isn't actually a link on the port that is shut/no-shut it wouldn't work anyways.<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:17:21] &lt;jb&gt; nevermind.<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:17:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; heh<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:18:12] &lt;jb&gt;

Sam-I-Am: have you updated that transform since you gave it to me last?<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:19:45] &lt;jb&gt; i have no idea why it came in as snmpTraps.3.. guess another MIB isn't loaded.<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:21:26] &lt;jb&gt; Sam-I-Am: did you just apply your link transform to /Net/Link, or something more specific?<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:24:10] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its in /status/interface/link<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:24:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; but it could be in /net/link too... doesnt matter much<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:24:55] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the special one is apparently /status/ipinterface which changes zenoss's little red/green interface status icons<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:25:11] &lt;jb&gt; ah<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:25:18] &lt;jb&gt; but thats from polling, right?<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:25:33] &lt;Simon4&gt; Sam-I-Am: really? that's interesting to know<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:26:03] &lt;jb&gt; i'm guessing my snmpTraps.3 was really a linkDown.<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:27:22] &lt;jb&gt; yep, it contains ifDescr and all of that.<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:27:34] &lt;jb&gt; does the actual description of the port not come in via the trap?<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:27:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; /Status/IpInterface can work for traps too, you just need to make sure that the component of the event is the interface name<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:27:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and make sure you have down events cleared by up events<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:27:54] &lt;jb&gt; ie, the "description &lt;bleh&gt;"<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:29:52] &lt;jb&gt; rmatte: looks like linkUp/Down aren't translating correctly, either :/<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:30:16] &lt;rmatte&gt;

rmatte: it's useful for getting things with spaces and other magic characters in em<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:49:57] &lt;Simon4&gt; we had issues with interfacemap and interfacealiasmap, hence the mangling of the interface name<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:50:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I've done similar before, but never thought of using it to call on a description for an interface directly<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:51:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've used getZopeObj<br/>[07-Apr-2011 17:51:31] &lt;rmatte&gt;

what i put in place is a transform in /Unknown to do stuff with it<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:14:26] &lt;kokey&gt; but i figure i'm not doing it in the best way<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:14:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i also have some alerting rules set up for unknown alerts from critical devices so we catch stuff that may be a problem, but i havent seen in operation yet to classify<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:15:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

yes<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:18:53] &lt;kokey&gt; eventclasskey is the name it gets from the MIB I assume<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:23:29] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yeah<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:23:34] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its evt.eventClassKey<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:23:49] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt;

ok, seems like these come in as only one of 4 different eventClasskeys<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:27:14] &lt;kokey&gt; so I'll set up event classes for those, and create the mappings<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:58:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm strange, I'm using the HPSIMMonitor ZenPack which maps temperature sensors to the hardware tab of devices...<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:58:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; but there's no template included with it to actually monitor those sensors, so I'm making one<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:59:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; I checked the code for the plugin in the pack that maps them, and it's class is Products.ZenModel.TemperatureSensor<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:59:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I created a template with that class, created some datapoints and a graph, but I don't see anything when I click on the sensors<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:59:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; not even a broken graph<br/>[12-Apr-2011 10:59:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:00:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh wait, I think I see<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:04:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; nope, damn<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:08:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; aha, got it, it was the name of the template<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:13:10] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; hey guys<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:13:35] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; i'm trying to monitor inbound interface drops and believe I have the right OID however it's always a very high number and the graph shows a steady line<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:13:48] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; shouldn't this counter at some point get cleared so the value doesn't just keep rising?<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:14:11] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; i bet it has something to do with the "type" of my RRD graph<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:14:20] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt;

there is a concise explanation there<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:16:22] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; alright<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:16:27] * JohnnyNoc fires up the admin guide<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:16:28] &lt;rocket&gt; basically you probably need to change it to a gauge<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:16:36] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; it is a gauge currently<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:16:36] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:16:55] &lt;rocket&gt; err maybe counter then unless you need negative values<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:17:02] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt;

A source declared as COUNTER will save the rate of change of the value over a step period<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:18:01] &lt;rocket&gt; eg for traffic counters you usually want a counter<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:18:46] &lt;rocket&gt; eg that gives packets/s .. it sounds like you are just graphing packets which doesnt make as much sense in your scenario<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:19:31] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; hrm<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:19:56] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; i guess i'm making the assumption that the way outdrops are being monitored in the ethernetCsmacd_64 template is correct which is why i did it the way i did<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:20:19] &lt;rocket&gt; well it might be accurate for small drops<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:20:30] &lt;rocket&gt; eg if you dropped 3 packets you would want to know that<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:21:01] &lt;rocket&gt; but if yuo are dropping hundreds of packets or have a high rate of droppage that needs to be looked at differently<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:21:13] &lt;Simon4&gt; JohnnyNoc: ifOutDrops is a COUNTER type<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:21:38] &lt;rocket&gt; Simon4: thanks I hadnt gone back to look<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:21:52] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; Simon4 where did you look?&#160; i'm just going off whats in the template<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:22:10] &lt;rocket&gt; JohnnyNoc: did you check each datapoint?<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:22:13] &lt;Simon4&gt; JohnnyNoc: in our ethernetCsmacd_64 template<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:22:29] &lt;rocket&gt;

JohnnyNoc: just saw what you were saying... what value are you graphing?<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:32:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; Is it ifLastChange?<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:32:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, ifOutDrops<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:32:50] &lt;Simon4&gt; JohnnyNoc: you'll need to check that rrd files weren't generated with type of GAUGE<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:33:26] &lt;Simon4&gt; if they are, you won't see any difference changing it to counter without moving the gauge ones out of the way from memory<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:33:44] &lt;Simon4&gt; the datapoint setting only affects rrd file creation<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:34:00] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; Simon4 i was going to ask - is it safe to just blow the drops away?<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:34:16] &lt;Simon4&gt;

looks like the problem was using the wrong type for RRD<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:34:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; JohnnyNoc: Make sure the datasource type is COUNTER, and then blow away the existing RRDs<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:34:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; that should fix it<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:35:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you use GAUGE it'll graph the literal value, and you'll end up with a graph that remains steady or just keeps increasing<br/>[12-Apr-2011 11:36:00] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt;

which seems to be how to map a tcp port to a display name<br/>[14-Apr-2011 13:47:14] &lt;jmp242&gt; so if it does work, you might get tcp_1433<br/>[14-Apr-2011 13:47:28] &lt;jmp242&gt; as the name, but with the service keys you could have that in there and name it MSSQL for instance<br/>[14-Apr-2011 13:47:36] &lt;jmp242&gt;

and I can't see how I could usefully open a ticket either<br/>[14-Apr-2011 14:02:50] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; must be the way it scans some open tcp ports<br/>[14-Apr-2011 14:02:55] &lt;jmp242&gt; cause I have no info<br/>[14-Apr-2011 14:03:02] &lt;citrusfizz&gt;

I hadn't remembered I'd seen that in there before<br/>[14-Apr-2011 14:42:34] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; jmp242: also note,&#160; when using nmap it will only show the ports that are open that nmap can GET to ,&#160;

citrusfizz: you can influence that by telling zenoss which are the Local interfaces, I think.<br/>[14-Apr-2011 14:43:33] &lt;Simon4&gt; citrusfizz: that's correct, but the "is it alive" checker on zenoss tries to connect to the port anyway<br/>[14-Apr-2011 14:43:43] &lt;Simon4&gt;

if i want to monitor a specific port i will just open it on the firewall&#160; no big issue<br/>[14-Apr-2011 14:46:19] &lt;akafritz&gt; hmm, one more question about this event class mapping to ignore high memory usage events.&#160;

jmp242:&#160; i found that the port range isn't sufficiant to include MSSQL 1433&#160; so i put a zero at the end of the port range,&#160;&#160; however when&#160; i tested this from command line it took 30 seconds.&#160; and taking out the port range all together was only 6 seconds.&#160; but still returned 1433<br/>[14-Apr-2011 14:50:19] &lt;jmp242&gt; right - if you don't specify a port, I believe nmap will use it's "dictionary" of ports<br/>[14-Apr-2011 14:50:40] &lt;jmp242&gt;

You look at a group of people crossing the street and it's like a UN summit<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:09:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:09:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; where?<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:09:17] &lt;rmatte&gt;

kokey: what about god complexes? or is that the building super?<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:12:38] &lt;kokey&gt; building management seems to act in mysterious ways<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:12:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh.. is Kokey in NYC?&#160; I associate the phrase "building super" with NYC for some reason<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:13:21] &lt;kokey&gt; i'm in london, our building has 9 flats<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:13:31] &lt;kokey&gt; or as the english calls it 'houses'<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:18:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; you call apartments houses?<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:19:23] &lt;Simon4&gt; our english landlord calls em flats<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:19:48] &lt;kokey&gt; depends, but what i would consider a 3 bedroom flat, they'll still call a house<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:19:53] &lt;froztbyte&gt; what about your scottish landlord?<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:19:59] &lt;Simon4&gt; froztbyte: I don't talk about him<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:20:13] &lt;kokey&gt; like terraced flats, they call houses<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:20:24] &lt;froztbyte&gt; Simon4: hehe<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:20:35] &lt;kokey&gt; it only seems to be a flat if it's horrible and owned by the government<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:20:46] &lt;froztbyte&gt; kokey: that's probably because those are the biggest things generally available <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:20:49] &lt;kokey&gt; and if it's not horrible and privately owned, they call it an apartment<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:21:12] &lt;kokey&gt; unless it's like 3 bedroomed or split over more than one level, it becomes a house somehow<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:21:13] &lt;froztbyte&gt; sigh, so much to do still today <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:21:16] &lt;froztbyte&gt; and it's 18h21<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:21:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; weird<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:22:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; Here apartments are rented, condos are owned, and houses are basically anything where you own all floors in it.<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:23:11] &lt;kokey&gt; rmatte: that makes sense to me<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:23:18] &lt;kokey&gt; "An apartment (in American English) or flat (in British English) is a self-contained housing unit (a type of residential real estate) that occupies only part of a building."<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:23:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; Condos: the idea of not owning both sides of the walls is anathema to me <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:23:28] &lt;kokey&gt; but in the UK even if it's part of a building they often call it a house<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:23:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: well, there are townhouses too where you don't own both sides of the walls technically<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:23:53] &lt;kokey&gt; in my mind only a detached property is a house<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:24:09] &lt;kokey&gt; rmatte: what you would call townhouses, they also just call a 'house' in the uk<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:24:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; townhouses are two houses connected by a wall<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:24:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; rmatte: what about "duplex"?<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:24:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; duplex is the technical term that you'd hear a real estate agent use here, but you wouldn't hear it in regular conversation<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:25:03] &lt;kokey&gt; and the british meaning of 'townhouse' is "A townhouse (or townhome derived from "house in town") is the term historically used in the United Kingdom, Ireland and in many other countries to describe a residence of a peer or member of the aristocracy in the capital or major city"<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:25:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; we use it here (California), where almost all duplexes are single-story<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:25:26] &lt;kokey&gt; heh<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:25:35] &lt;kokey&gt; in south africa duplex flats are 2 storey<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:25:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; almost all of our townhouses/duplex are two story<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:25:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; I would think of "townhouse" as being like a row0-house in a city, I guess<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:25:38] &lt;kokey&gt; and triplex 3 storey<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:26:01] &lt;Simon4&gt; duplex implies 2 story <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:26:11] &lt;kokey&gt; and if it's just one layer of duplexes... it would be a townhouse complex, and if it's multiple layers then it's a building of flats<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:26:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; But the real question is: do they have snmp agents?<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:26:27] &lt;Simon4&gt; davetoo: the agents I deal with are pretty simple, for sure<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:26:42] &lt;kokey&gt; they suck at management tho<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:26:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; one story houses here are called bungalows, and they are generally not connected to another unit<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:27:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; here: bungalows are generally tiny detached things that might otherwise be called a "granny flat", i.e. where you have grandma living in the back yard <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:28:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's tons of space to build around here though... I would imagine that a city like London is a bit more cramped when it comes to living accommodations.<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:28:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; just my guess<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:28:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; rmatte: what are your gasoline prices like right now?<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:29:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: around $1.15 to $1.20 per litre<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:29:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; CDN, right?<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:29:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:29:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; and litres, not gallons<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:30:03] &lt;Simon4&gt; &#194;&#163;1.27/L here<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:31:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; 1 euro is 1.38 CAD right now<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:31:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually sorry<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:31:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; 1.27 is 1.38 CAD<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:31:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; so close enough<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:31:35] &lt;davetoo&gt; US $4.27 per US Gal for 87 RON<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:31:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; that US price looks about the same too<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:32:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; the highest I'<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:32:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; ve ever seen it<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:32:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; and it's not even summer yet<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:32:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; Far from the highest that I've seen it here<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:32:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've seen it at 1.47 CAD one time<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:32:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; which would be over $5/gallon<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:33:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, hadn't noticed that the US dollar is ahead of ours again<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:33:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; not by much though, 3 cents more<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:34:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; last week I put US $63.00 worth of 87 octane (the cheapest) in my 4runner<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:34:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; that's the higheste ever<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:34:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; it's a shocker<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:35:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; an F150 costs around $150 to fill here<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:35:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; ironic<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:35:44] &lt;Simon4&gt; do you get further than around the block in one of those on a tank?<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:36:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; Yeh you do, but only because it has a huge tank<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:36:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; they burn through dinosaurs pretty good<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:36:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; I only have my 4runner because I was hauling my motorcycle to the racetrack every three or four weeks for several summers<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:36:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:36:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe time to switch to something else lol<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:36:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; well I want to go back <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:36:51] &lt;kokey&gt;

Value too large for defined data type<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:51:20] &lt;kokey&gt; is the output of a gzip somewhere<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:52:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; odd<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:52:35] &lt;kokey&gt; the monitoring guy that's been here for years<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:52:42] &lt;kokey&gt; he likes doing everything as snmp traps<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:52:57] &lt;kokey&gt; and then stuff that follows logs that sends more traps, etc.<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:53:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; syslog is less of a pain in the ass, but whatever<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:53:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:53:14] &lt;kokey&gt; and then when the thing that sends traps fails, he build stuff that checks if it's up and send out reports as traps too<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:53:36] &lt;kokey&gt; well this trap is actually from something that follows a syslog and then send the trap out<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:53:42] &lt;kokey&gt; it's silly hard to maintain<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:54:54] &lt;kokey&gt; heh<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:55:06] &lt;kokey&gt; ok the script that fails, was written by the director<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:55:11] &lt;kokey&gt; so i'm going to worry less about it now<br/>[18-Apr-2011 12:55:17] &lt;kokey&gt;

citrusfizz: as far as I was aware, that nmap plugin doesn't even work...<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:10:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; is it actually picking up things for you?<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:11:09] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; i had to install nmap and simlink it in $ZENHOME/libexec&#160; and then tweak the paramaters a bit in configuration properties<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:11:22] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; but it picked up all the ports i wanted it to after that<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:11:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:11:34] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; i was having problems with the default one not seeing any mssql stuff<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:11:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; the default one uses snmp, so if it's not exposed via SNMP it won't see it<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:12:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is the case with any ipv6 stuff<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:13:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; as far as why it's not seeing the ports close, I'm not sure.<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:13:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could try running the zenstatus daemon against that specific device<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:13:41] &lt;rmatte&gt;

i quit smokey cigs&#160; only way to do it was to drink every time i had a craving,&#160;&#160; was drunk for 3 days.<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:35:17] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; successfully quit for 3 years and took up cigars<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:35:25] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; took a while before i grew into the taste<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:35:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; citrusfizz: yeh, that doesn't work for me since I only have cravings to smoke when I drink.<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:36:08] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; i find it more managable to be drunk and have a craving tho then to be sober<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:36:14] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; just make sure you can't reach any cigs<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:36:18] &lt;citrusfizz&gt;

lol<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:37:25] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; what about pot or some pharmies to get you by?<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:37:27] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; like xanax<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:37:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; everyone reacts to it differently I guess, this just happens to be the best way for me to approach it<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:37:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't smoke pot, and I want to do this without putting even more drugs in to my system lol<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:37:59] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; yeah,&#160; its just a bitch<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:38:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:38:15] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; first 3 days are hell&#160;&#160; you will do anything to convince your self to go buy a pack<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:38:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've been through this many times... made it up to like 2 weeks once, but it's always the same story, I'll be out drinking and I'll break down and smoke lol<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:38:48] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; then after 3 days its all about experiancing the times you would normally have a cig&#160; with out having one.&#160;&#160;&#160; like after a big meal or after a movie.<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:38:59] &lt;citrusfizz&gt;

well, if I can make it to 2 months I might as well just continue<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:40:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; I drink enough that I'm sure I've done some damage, best to just stay away from it for like a year or something, then return with extreme moderation.<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:40:05] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; yeah but drinking can be fun and benificial in a social way.&#160;&#160;&#160; plus i don't think its near as bad as cigs&#160;&#160; unless you abuse the fuck out of it<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:40:11] &lt;citrusfizz&gt;

put all that cash to something awesome to reward your self<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:44:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; the house would be my reward hehe<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:44:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I paid off a 10g credit line that was maxed out and I've just started stashing money in an RRSP<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:44:35] &lt;citrusfizz&gt;

no grass to cut, no snow to shovel<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:46:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; the downside is no BBQ<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:46:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; but oh well<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:46:15] &lt;citrusfizz&gt;

I remember watching something about London where they were explaining that few people actually own their homes, they just sort of rent them from the bank or something...<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:50:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; or maybe it was paris that they do that<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:50:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; can't remember<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:51:09] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; i think i saw something that paris was the most expensive city to live<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:51:14] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; then tokyo then nyc<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:51:18] &lt;citrusfizz&gt; if i remember correctly<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:51:23] &lt;Simon4&gt; paris property prices are definitely scary<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:51:26] &lt;Simon4&gt; and apartments are tiny<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:51:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I think it was paris... they were showing this 3 bedroom condo (apartment), and it was worth over a million dollars<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:51:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the people living there didn't actually own it, the bank owned the home and they rented it from the bank<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:51:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; crazy<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:51:58] &lt;Simon4&gt; &#226;&sbquo;&#172;5-600k for a one bedroom flat that's about 33sq m<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:52:06] &lt;citrusfizz&gt;

that's how banks make money lol<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:53:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd have to be out of your mind to pay prices like that for a one bedroom flat<br/>[18-Apr-2011 13:53:36] &lt;citrusfizz&gt;

[25-Apr-2011 17:34:40] &lt;moath&gt; checks for the content and then&#160; re-assigns the event class [25-Apr-2011 17:34:57] &lt;moath&gt; or should I add a rule at the&#160; "Uknown" class level since it's a syslog event? [25-Apr-2011 17:35:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; moath: is the rule applied against&#160; the call or is it an actual mapping?

[25-Apr-2011 17:36:23] &lt;moath&gt; yea [25-Apr-2011 17:36:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so what you would want to do&#160; is this... [25-Apr-2011 17:36:35] &lt;moath&gt; i was wondering if I should be&#160; adding the rule there or what [25-Apr-2011 17:37:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; first off, do what you just said,&#160; add additional python/regex/transform rules to narrow down what the&#160; mapping actually applies to [25-Apr-2011 17:37:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; then create a second mapping in&#160; the other class against kernel (as the eventClassKey) [25-Apr-2011 17:37:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; and do the same [25-Apr-2011 17:38:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can create multiple mappings&#160; against the same eventClassKey, they just have to have appropriate rules&#160; to narrow down what they apply to [25-Apr-2011 17:38:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know basically every trick in&#160; the book when it comes to event mapping in Zenoss... been working with&#160; it for a long time <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><span> [25-Apr-2011 17:38:46] &lt;moath&gt; gotcha [25-Apr-2011 17:39:11] &lt;moath&gt; what's the best way to validate the&#160; rules you've got set up? [25-Apr-2011 17:39:20] &lt;moath&gt; just use logger on the host or&#160; something? [25-Apr-2011 17:39:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; you mean to test them? [25-Apr-2011 17:39:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I personally just wait for actual&#160; events to come in [25-Apr-2011 17:39:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's really no better way to do&#160; it [25-Apr-2011 17:39:59] &lt;moath&gt; gotcha [25-Apr-2011 17:40:20] &lt;moath&gt; need to learn more about deduping&#160; events too [25-Apr-2011 17:40:24] &lt;moath&gt; lots of dupes at this point [25-Apr-2011 17:40:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, some things you'll want&#160; duped [25-Apr-2011 17:40:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; it saves space in the event&#160; database [25-Apr-2011 17:41:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; since you'll only have one entry&#160; for say 1000 events instead of 1000 separate entries [25-Apr-2011 17:41:18] &lt;moath&gt; interesting [25-Apr-2011 17:42:31] &lt;moath&gt; i suppose with more mapping&#160; refinement I can then set up thresholds for count X of event mapping Y? [25-Apr-2011 17:43:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, using event counts in&#160; mappings is pretty close to impossible because of the way the event&#160; system was designed [25-Apr-2011 17:43:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you can reference counts in&#160; alerting rules [25-Apr-2011 17:44:09] &lt;moath&gt; ahh, cool [25-Apr-2011 17:52:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk for a few [25-Apr-2011 18:29:59] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; is there a doc on how to&#160; write own modeler plugin?

[26-Apr-2011 12:04:37] &lt;kokey&gt; kind of like puppet is planning to&#160; do [26-Apr-2011 12:04:45] &lt;kokey&gt; then customers can buy for custom&#160; zenpack stuff [26-Apr-2011 12:04:45] &lt;fragfutter&gt; kokey: yeah and next thing we&#160; call then ZenApps [26-Apr-2011 12:05:01] &lt;kokey&gt; i mean pay for custom stuff [26-Apr-2011 12:05:11] &lt;kokey&gt; and then the zenpacks can either be&#160; made available to the community [26-Apr-2011 12:05:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a command datapoint&#160; script... in it, I am currently using self.targetPythonClass and passing&#160; that to the command script, so that it knows what kind of template it's&#160; dealing with... [26-Apr-2011 12:05:26] &lt;kokey&gt; or if they want, it can be sold for&#160; a fee, and the business that paid to have it written can have a little&#160; cut [26-Apr-2011 12:05:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: the problem is, that this&#160; forces me to specifically rig the script to look in certain locations&#160; based on certain targetPythonClasses [26-Apr-2011 12:06:04] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: I *think* I am following [26-Apr-2011 12:06:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; is there a function that I'm not&#160; aware of that would, for instance, allow me to know that a certain&#160; target class stores it's RRDs in os.interfaces or os.filesystem? [26-Apr-2011 12:06:13] &lt;fragfutter&gt; kokey: please don't. Either&#160; you pay the manufacturer to implement stuff for you, or you hire a&#160; developer. There is no need to start with marketplaces [26-Apr-2011 12:06:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I need to be able to tell the&#160; script where to use the getRRDValue function [26-Apr-2011 12:06:52] &lt;kokey&gt; well, here's the thing, there are&#160; lot of paid for stuff out there developed for zenoss [26-Apr-2011 12:06:58] &lt;kokey&gt; that no one else has access to [26-Apr-2011 12:07:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; right now I do stuff like...

[26-Apr-2011 12:07:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd rather have the datasource&#160; script actually pass the location (os.processes) or whatever to the&#160; script directly [26-Apr-2011 12:07:47] &lt;fragfutter&gt; kokey: such is life. i have a&#160; lot of code that will never leave the company. Even if it is useful to&#160; others. [26-Apr-2011 12:07:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; that would make it work for every&#160; template regardless of type [26-Apr-2011 12:08:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll pastebin the datasource code [26-Apr-2011 12:08:56] &lt;nyeates&gt; I kind of like the idae of&#160; marketplaces in the open source world [26-Apr-2011 12:09:07] &lt;nyeates&gt; i will ahve to take a look at&#160; puppetes implement of it [26-Apr-2011 12:09:12] &lt;nyeates&gt; how does it work? [26-Apr-2011 12:09:19] * fragfutter hates marketplaces.&#160; [26-Apr-2011 12:09:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://fpaste.org/qYDx/">http://fpaste.org/qYDx/</a><span> [26-Apr-2011 12:09:42] &lt;nyeates&gt; frag: why? [26-Apr-2011 12:09:57] &lt;nyeates&gt; if you dont like it, dont go use&#160; it....still gives stuff to others [26-Apr-2011 12:10:19] &lt;fragfutter&gt; all those stupid little "hey&#160; look i wrote a small program, it's yours for .99 cents". It kills open&#160; source communities. [26-Apr-2011 12:10:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: I'm passing in&#160; targetPythonClass to the script via the --target option [26-Apr-2011 12:11:05] &lt;nyeates&gt; frag: yeah, you are right to a&#160; degree. I see nothing wrong with this. Work cannot always be done for&#160; free or sponsored by benefactors [26-Apr-2011 12:11:23] &lt;nyeates&gt; many times open source acan&#160; succeed, but not always [26-Apr-2011 12:12:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; those small 99 cent apps are get&#160; rich quick schemes, plain and simple [26-Apr-2011 12:12:35] &lt;nyeates&gt; plus, i am thinking of ways where&#160; you can have a marketplace AND open source...its possible [26-Apr-2011 12:12:38] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: I dont think there is a&#160; way to pass that to the script directly without using the command line&#160; options you are using [26-Apr-2011 12:12:58] &lt;fragfutter&gt; most programs that publish in&#160; marketplaces, had the benefit to use lots of open source code. But their&#160; small program is different? They want a quick-rich scheme? [26-Apr-2011 12:13:07] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: I havent reviewed it&#160; fully, gotten deep enough into it to really understand what you are&#160; trying to accomplish however [26-Apr-2011 12:13:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: to sum it up, in the&#160; datasource script I have access to the target python class for whatever&#160; given template the datasource happens to be in [26-Apr-2011 12:14:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: the script itself performs&#160; mathematical operations on datapoints in a template [26-Apr-2011 12:14:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; to get the values to perform the&#160; calculations, I need to be able to execute getRRDValue in the right&#160; location (where that particular type of template is storing the RRD&#160; data) [26-Apr-2011 12:15:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; so far I've just hardcoded all of&#160; the more common locations based on the targetPythonClasses [26-Apr-2011 12:15:04] &lt;nyeates&gt; I doubt that many app store devs&#160; are getting rich quick. Yes, a handful, angrybirds maybe, but not many. I&#160; think its more of a capitalistic scheme, where you provide work, and&#160; get paid for said work. As a consumer, I find the 99 cent price points&#160; quick attractive and useful over what used to exist. [26-Apr-2011 12:15:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I want it to be more dynamic [26-Apr-2011 12:15:21] &lt;fragfutter&gt; a nice way to have it is "you&#160; pay me to develop this custom feature for you". And then you can deal&#160; along lines of "it will be exclusively for you", "you will have it&#160; exclusively for a year", "i publish it as open source to up my&#160; reputation and you will pay less" [26-Apr-2011 12:15:46] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: you may look at the new&#160; python api as a possible way around that .. eg I know its not the&#160; greatest at being documented but you dont go directly after the rrds&#160; then [26-Apr-2011 12:16:01] &lt;rocket&gt; the limitation with your method is&#160; the rrd locations may change etc .. [26-Apr-2011 12:16:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: true [26-Apr-2011 12:17:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; if not much documentation exists&#160; for it though then I'll just be spinning my tires lol [26-Apr-2011 12:17:37] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: understandable, however it&#160; really isnt too hard to use once you take a look at it [26-Apr-2011 12:18:03] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: it also helps in the fact&#160; that you dont need to worry if the rrd is on a local collector or remote&#160; etc [26-Apr-2011 12:18:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, I thought getRRDValue took&#160; that in to account [26-Apr-2011 12:18:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; guess not [26-Apr-2011 12:18:51] &lt;rocket&gt; it does [26-Apr-2011 12:18:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah [26-Apr-2011 12:19:15] &lt;fragfutter&gt; nyeates: oh and i send you the&#160; devlogs by mail. [26-Apr-2011 12:19:33] &lt;rocket&gt; I am just saying the api takes all&#160; of that frontend work and does it for you ... the backend methods are&#160; starting to change more [26-Apr-2011 12:19:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: I'm just wondering how&#160; Zenoss itself actually figures out where to store/read the RRDs from [26-Apr-2011 12:19:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; This channel could use a&#160; "diversity" bot/logger </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> [26-Apr-2011 12:19:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: if I can figure that out, I&#160; can duplicate that in my actual script (which has full access to dmd) [26-Apr-2011 12:20:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; guess I'll dig through the code&#160; and see if I can find it [26-Apr-2011 12:20:14] &lt;rocket&gt; oh ..

[27-Apr-2011 11:16:24] &lt;jb&gt; sometimes I'd like to revert back to&#160; 2.5 </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/> [27-Apr-2011 11:17:00] &lt;nyeates&gt; I think events have to come into&#160; the database before alerts (emails) are enacted [27-Apr-2011 11:18:09] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; hmmm wish i could add locations&#160; to a zenpack [27-Apr-2011 11:18:53] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; or even alerting rules... [27-Apr-2011 11:19:26] &lt;nyeates&gt; huh....didnt know u could not [27-Apr-2011 11:19:46] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; dont see the usual 'add to&#160; zenpack' option [27-Apr-2011 11:19:50] &lt;nyeates&gt; hadnt tried it either tho [27-Apr-2011 11:20:29] &lt;kokey&gt; nyeates: helps a bit, but i figure i&#160; might have to do something clever with ageing events instead then [27-Apr-2011 11:21:52] &lt;nyeates&gt; you could easily have it where,&#160; first event comes in, caues alert, stays in DB. Second (duplicate event)&#160; comes in, transform drops the event now. [27-Apr-2011 11:22:10] &lt;nyeates&gt; that is assuming 2 repeat events&#160; though [27-Apr-2011 11:22:22] &lt;nyeates&gt; ...which can be common [27-Apr-2011 11:22:55] &lt;kokey&gt; nyeates: actually, the real issue&#160; is that we have traps coming in that we want to send page alerts for,&#160; but we want alerts on the duplicates to get sent out too [27-Apr-2011 11:24:01] &lt;nyeates&gt; then....why are you saying you&#160; care to have the event sent to history? [27-Apr-2011 11:24:05] &lt;kokey&gt; nyeates: in a hurry I simply made&#160; it add a randomly generated eventKey to each of those, but now those are&#160; building up in the events list [27-Apr-2011 11:24:33] &lt;kokey&gt; so a bodge to deal with the bodge&#160; would be to send those to history [27-Apr-2011 11:24:46] &lt;kokey&gt; but I guess there's a more elegant&#160; way to deal with the original issue [27-Apr-2011 11:25:56] &lt;fragfutter&gt; kokey: make a transform that&#160; modifies the dedupid (for example by including a timestamp) then every&#160; event is unique [27-Apr-2011 11:26:23] &lt;nyeates&gt; so lost....randomly generated?&#160; why do u even need an eventKey in first place? also still dont get why&#160; send traps to history automatically. You can do this manually for the&#160; ones built up there [27-Apr-2011 11:26:36] &lt;kokey&gt; fragfutter: that's what i've done,&#160; now i have tons of events just sitting there [27-Apr-2011 11:27:28] &lt;kokey&gt; ok just forget what I have said I&#160; have done... this is what I want to do: every time a certain snmp trap&#160; comes in, alert on it every time, but don't let those build up in the&#160; event console [27-Apr-2011 11:28:29] &lt;kokey&gt; the reason for this is historical&#160; really, since we've migrated away from openview [27-Apr-2011 11:28:46] &lt;kokey&gt; but basically, we have systemedge&#160; monitoring say the application logs, for certain things [27-Apr-2011 11:29:03] &lt;kokey&gt; when those certain things happen,&#160; it sends out an SNMP trap, and we send a page out each time [27-Apr-2011 11:30:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ideally someone would clear the&#160; event [27-Apr-2011 11:30:24] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; or simply keep sending alerts&#160; until someone acks or clears it [27-Apr-2011 11:31:01] &lt;kokey&gt; Sam-I-Am: yeah you must have a&#160; similar requirement like this [27-Apr-2011 11:31:20] &lt;kokey&gt; I'm sitting with a weird solution&#160; because of how things worked here before [27-Apr-2011 11:31:34] &lt;kokey&gt; personally I prefer traps to tie to&#160; a status, and people getting alerted on a change of status [27-Apr-2011 11:31:36] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; in my case either the trap&#160; clears itself (with some other trap), someone clears it, or it will keep&#160; alerting until its cleared or ack'd [27-Apr-2011 11:32:10] &lt;kokey&gt; Sam-I-Am: how does it keep alerting&#160; until someone clears it, won't it only send one alert because the next&#160; one is a duplicate? [27-Apr-2011 11:32:23] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the alerting rules are set to&#160; repeat [27-Apr-2011 11:32:35] &lt;kokey&gt; ah ok, that doesn't help me [27-Apr-2011 11:33:00] &lt;kokey&gt; I guess the option to let the trap&#160; clear itself is what I am after [27-Apr-2011 11:33:15] &lt;kokey&gt; I guess it's similar to how process&#160; restarts are alerted on [27-Apr-2011 11:33:19] &lt;kokey&gt; how is that done? [27-Apr-2011 11:33:26] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; that or maybe generating a&#160; random number in the transform and stuffing it someplace where it would&#160; prevent zenoss from detecting a dupe [27-Apr-2011 11:34:00] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; might be able to just turn off&#160; duplicate detection [27-Apr-2011 11:34:09] &lt;kokey&gt; Sam-I-Am: that's what I've done,&#160; but my issue is now an event console full of those non-dupes [27-Apr-2011 11:34:19] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; well, thats what you're asking&#160; for [27-Apr-2011 11:34:25] &lt;kokey&gt; yeah duplicate detection [27-Apr-2011 11:34:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; if nothing clears them, they're&#160; going to stick around [27-Apr-2011 11:34:57] &lt;kokey&gt; is there an easy way to disable&#160; duplicate detection for an event? [27-Apr-2011 11:35:15] &lt;kokey&gt; I thought if that funtionality was&#160; intended it would have been easy and I would have seen it already [27-Apr-2011 11:36:37] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the idea of zenoss is stuff&#160; thats intended to self-clear will do it [27-Apr-2011 11:37:00] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; like... something starts pinging&#160; again.&#160; no reason to manually deal with that... and no reason to have a&#160; ton of similar events. [27-Apr-2011 11:37:08] &lt;kokey&gt; well [27-Apr-2011 11:37:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I don't get why you'd want 1&#160; event for each similar type of event [27-Apr-2011 11:37:31] &lt;kokey&gt; well, one example [27-Apr-2011 11:37:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; the count and the last time values&#160; update with every new event [27-Apr-2011 11:37:37] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; at least if they're exactly the&#160; same [27-Apr-2011 11:37:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh [27-Apr-2011 11:37:43] &lt;kokey&gt; well [27-Apr-2011 11:37:50] &lt;kokey&gt; I can come up with lots of examples&#160; of that [27-Apr-2011 11:37:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll only match them if they are&#160; EXACTLY the same [27-Apr-2011 11:37:58] &lt;kokey&gt; e.g. let's say there's an exception&#160; in an application log [27-Apr-2011 11:38:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; any variations and it will be&#160; treated as a new event [27-Apr-2011 11:38:03] &lt;kokey&gt; e.g. an object crashed [27-Apr-2011 11:38:06] &lt;kokey&gt; and we want to alert on that [27-Apr-2011 11:38:13] &lt;kokey&gt; the object never recovers [27-Apr-2011 11:38:15] &lt;kokey&gt; so it never clears [27-Apr-2011 11:38:24] &lt;kokey&gt; we want to be alerted every time&#160; that object crashes [27-Apr-2011 11:38:33] &lt;kokey&gt; or rather, an instance of that&#160; object [27-Apr-2011 11:38:34] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; if it never recovers, someone&#160; should be fixing it [27-Apr-2011 11:38:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; kokey: yeh, why is someone not&#160; fixing it? lol [27-Apr-2011 11:38:55] &lt;kokey&gt; ok, bad example [27-Apr-2011 11:39:06] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; thats why i have alert repeating [27-Apr-2011 11:39:07] &lt;kokey&gt; let's say we want to alert every&#160; time someone dies [27-Apr-2011 11:39:13] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; if someone doesnt wake up, they&#160; will eventually [27-Apr-2011 11:40:11] &lt;kokey&gt; ok [27-Apr-2011 11:40:13] &lt;kokey&gt; here's an example [27-Apr-2011 11:40:22] &lt;kokey&gt; from our actual setup [27-Apr-2011 11:40:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; kokey: people should be going in&#160; and clearing the events by hand after the issue is resolved [27-Apr-2011 11:40:37] &lt;kokey&gt; we want to alert each time a&#160; certain type of transaction is declined [27-Apr-2011 11:40:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; kokey: one notification should be&#160; enough, otherwise you're spamming people [27-Apr-2011 11:41:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if that transaction is declined&#160; 1000 times in a minute you want 1000 emails to fly out, is basically&#160; what you're saying [27-Apr-2011 11:41:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; which makes zero sense to me [27-Apr-2011 11:42:21] &lt;kokey&gt; rmatte: well, the alternative is&#160; that if duplications are supressed, we don't know when the next&#160; transaction is declined [27-Apr-2011 11:42:41] &lt;kokey&gt; it might be just one, out of 1000s,&#160; someone might take an hour to look into it [27-Apr-2011 11:42:53] &lt;kokey&gt; meanwhile in that hour we can have 5&#160; more of those and not know it [27-Apr-2011 11:43:22] &lt;kokey&gt; it seems like zenoss process&#160; restarts is the closest to these kinds of situations [27-Apr-2011 11:43:39] &lt;kokey&gt; and for that, zenoss sends out a&#160; clear event immediately after an alert, if I understand it correctly [27-Apr-2011 11:43:58] &lt;kokey&gt; to auto clear it [27-Apr-2011 11:44:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; kokey: when the issue is dealt&#160; with, the tech dealing with it should clear the event manually in Zenoss [27-Apr-2011 11:44:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; then if it comes back, you get&#160; another alert [27-Apr-2011 11:44:36] &lt;kokey&gt; that means no one has to&#160; acknowledge a process has been restarted, and also you will know if the&#160; process restarted 5 times in a row [27-Apr-2011 11:44:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're trying to over-automate&#160; things [27-Apr-2011 11:45:08] &lt;kokey&gt; rmatte: we literally have hundreds&#160; of things like these in place [27-Apr-2011 11:45:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; kokey: there is a way to&#160; deduplicate all events... but it's not a simple option in the UI, hold&#160; on, let me dig up the article [27-Apr-2011 11:45:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll be crying when you do it&#160; though <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><span> [27-Apr-2011 11:45:53] &lt;kokey&gt; no we only need to deduplicate some&#160; events [27-Apr-2011 11:46:09] &lt;kokey&gt; and i've also implemented a way to&#160; do it by changing the eventkey per event for some [27-Apr-2011 11:46:12] &lt;kokey&gt; which is also a bodge [27-Apr-2011 11:46:25] &lt;kokey&gt; what I want is what zenoss does for&#160; processes that restart [27-Apr-2011 11:46:26] &lt;nyeates&gt; wtf is a bodge [27-Apr-2011 11:46:36] &lt;kokey&gt; bodge.... bad hack [27-Apr-2011 11:46:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; kokey: you should be changing the&#160; dedupid [27-Apr-2011 11:46:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what it uses [27-Apr-2011 11:47:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; append some random number to the&#160; end of it or something [27-Apr-2011 11:47:22] &lt;kokey&gt; when a process restarts, it doesn't&#160; create a seperate event [27-Apr-2011 11:47:29] &lt;kokey&gt; it doesn't create a unique dedupid [27-Apr-2011 11:47:32] &lt;kokey&gt; and it sends an alert [27-Apr-2011 11:47:45] &lt;kokey&gt; and no one acknowledges it [27-Apr-2011 11:47:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; kokey: those also auto-clear [27-Apr-2011 11:47:54] &lt;kokey&gt; and that's the default behaviour [27-Apr-2011 11:47:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is different [27-Apr-2011 11:48:03] &lt;kokey&gt; which is exactly what I'm asking [27-Apr-2011 11:48:09] &lt;kokey&gt; how do you let someone else auto&#160; clear? [27-Apr-2011 11:48:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; some stuff just can't be&#160; auto-cleared [27-Apr-2011 11:48:13] &lt;kokey&gt; someone=something [27-Apr-2011 11:48:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; how do you autoclear a syslog&#160; message for instance? [27-Apr-2011 11:48:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can't [27-Apr-2011 11:48:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can auto-clear it hourly [27-Apr-2011 11:48:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you want it instantly\ [27-Apr-2011 11:48:54] &lt;kokey&gt; so you simply can't auto clear it,&#160; is what you are saying? [27-Apr-2011 11:49:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, let me put it this way... [27-Apr-2011 11:49:06] &lt;kokey&gt; it's just the process monitor that&#160; can do that by itself? [27-Apr-2011 11:49:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; this is what happens when an event&#160; auto-clears... [27-Apr-2011 11:49:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's the first event that comes&#160; in... [27-Apr-2011 11:49:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; then a second event comes in&#160; basically saying "Hey, i'm back up!" or whatever, which triggers the&#160; clearing of the first event [27-Apr-2011 11:49:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; do you have a second event coming&#160; in that you could use for that? [27-Apr-2011 11:49:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; if not, you're out of luck [27-Apr-2011 11:50:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; You can't just magically expect&#160; the system to know when you clear something [27-Apr-2011 11:50:43] &lt;kokey&gt; well i want to set it specifically&#160; for certain types of events, for stuff that doesn't clear [27-Apr-2011 11:50:51] &lt;fragfutter&gt; i think he just wants to use&#160; zenoss to distribute alerting. Incoming message, send out alerts, close&#160; mesage [27-Apr-2011 11:51:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you're going to end up with&#160; thousands of events just sitting around in your event console [27-Apr-2011 11:51:24] &lt;kokey&gt; fragfutter: for a certain massive&#160; group of cases, we want to replace them with something that can do&#160; status aware alerts over time but that's going to be another 1-2 year&#160; project [27-Apr-2011 11:51:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; the proper solution to deal with&#160; events that don't clear is human intervention... someone checks on the&#160; issue, then logs in to Zenoss and moves the event to history by hand [27-Apr-2011 11:51:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; either that, or set Zenoss to&#160; clear the events hourly. [27-Apr-2011 11:51:50] &lt;kokey&gt; ok [27-Apr-2011 11:51:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; which won't be as effective [27-Apr-2011 11:52:00] &lt;kokey&gt; for hourly clearing, can one do it&#160; for certain event classes? [27-Apr-2011 11:52:07] &lt;kokey&gt; e.g. i want the syslog type stuff&#160; cleared every hour [27-Apr-2011 11:52:12] &lt;kokey&gt; but the rest to remain there for&#160; longer [27-Apr-2011 11:52:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, it's global... you could&#160; write a script to do it only for certain classes and cron it [27-Apr-2011 11:52:38] &lt;kokey&gt; ok [27-Apr-2011 11:52:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have event clearing built in to a&#160; daemon that I wrote which generates tickets in our ticketing system for&#160; events [27-Apr-2011 11:52:43] &lt;kokey&gt; seems like what i will have to do [27-Apr-2011 11:52:54] &lt;kokey&gt; is stick an event correlation&#160; engine in between all this stuff and zenoss [27-Apr-2011 11:53:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; good luck with that lol [27-Apr-2011 11:53:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; we've been planning that for ages,&#160; it sounds simpler than it is [27-Apr-2011 11:53:24] &lt;kokey&gt; and then let that translate the&#160; stuff into up and down statuses [27-Apr-2011 11:53:37] &lt;kokey&gt; and for the rest just auto clear on&#160; a case by case basis [27-Apr-2011 11:54:12] &lt;kokey&gt; thing is we got a many hundred&#160; thousand dollar system that was based on hp openview that was basically&#160; classing and sending out traps based on how i described [27-Apr-2011 11:54:15] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; has anyone ever had problems&#160; with IP Services saying a port is up/listening when it isn't? [27-Apr-2011 11:54:24] &lt;kokey&gt; and massive amounts of stuff in&#160; place that detects things, and send them out as traps [27-Apr-2011 11:54:53] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; i can't seem to understand why&#160; Zenoss thinks DNS is running on a machine when it's not..&#160; and i've&#160; tried zenoss.portscan.ipservicesmap, zenoss.snmp.ipservicesmap,&#160; zenoss.nmap.ipservicesmap [27-Apr-2011 11:54:57] &lt;kokey&gt; now the first step was to hack that&#160; over into zenoss asap so we can switch off openview [27-Apr-2011 11:55:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; JohnnyNoc: make sure the service&#160; or the device isn't locked [27-Apr-2011 11:55:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it is, your remodels won't do&#160; anything [27-Apr-2011 11:55:24] &lt;kokey&gt; now the next step is to make the&#160; hack less noisy, then after that is to redo all those 6 years of work&#160; into some new way [27-Apr-2011 11:55:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, the nmap plugin doesn't work&#160; properly without manual modifications to the options and copying of&#160; nmap to the correct location [27-Apr-2011 11:55:42] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; rmatte but if i don't lock the&#160; service when i remodel it's gone [27-Apr-2011 11:55:48] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; rmatte i've done that for nmap [27-Apr-2011 11:55:58] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; created the dir, setup symlink,&#160; removed --open from options [27-Apr-2011 11:56:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; JohnnyNoc: of course it's gone,&#160; you just said that it's not up/listening [27-Apr-2011 11:56:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; which would mean it shouldn't be&#160; detected [27-Apr-2011 11:56:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're contradicting yourself [27-Apr-2011 11:56:54] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; ok i must not be understanding&#160; something then [27-Apr-2011 11:57:04] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; i want to monitor a port if&#160; it's up or down, why would remodeling remove that ipservice if it's down [27-Apr-2011 11:57:07] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; why wouldn't it alert that it's&#160; down [27-Apr-2011 11:57:10] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; that's what i'm trying to&#160; achive [27-Apr-2011 11:57:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, you're just saying that it's&#160; not actually sending an alert when the port goes down? [27-Apr-2011 11:57:38] &lt;_TORNADO_&gt; I want to save some space in my&#160; graph reports. And I want to change the graph header a bit. I've found&#160; it here - ~/Products/ZenModel/skins/zenmodel/zenrrdzoom.js . I've&#160; changed Zoom in/out to "+/-" and als changed the "&lt;/&gt;" buttons&#160; width from 65 to 15. But changes has not been applied evean after zenoss&#160; restart. Is there some cache I must clear? (browser cache was cleared&#160; also) [27-Apr-2011 11:57:39] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; not only that, but according to&#160; zenoss the service is up [27-Apr-2011 11:57:46] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; with a green light icon [27-Apr-2011 11:57:53] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; but DNS isn't even running on&#160; that machine [27-Apr-2011 11:57:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; JohnnyNoc: that just means there's&#160; no event for it in the event queue [27-Apr-2011 11:58:00] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; or any other service i've&#160; tested with for that matter [27-Apr-2011 11:58:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; the status is directly linked to&#160; whether or not a down event exists [27-Apr-2011 11:58:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; no event == gren [27-Apr-2011 11:58:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; green* [27-Apr-2011 11:58:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; anyways, restart the zenstatus&#160; daemon [27-Apr-2011 11:58:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; and try running it by hand...

[27-Apr-2011 11:59:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; what do you mean? [27-Apr-2011 11:59:12] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; i mean, why would it remove it&#160; from the list of ip serices to monitor during a remodel if it's down.&#160; i&#160; want it to alert that it's down. [27-Apr-2011 11:59:25] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; i must be going about this&#160; incorrectly [27-Apr-2011 11:59:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; because that's what remodels do&#160; lol... they model the CURRENT status of a device [27-Apr-2011 11:59:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if an ip server is down, it'll&#160; assume that it shouldn't be monitored anymore [27-Apr-2011 12:00:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is why you need to lock&#160; certain items on devices after modelling to prevent that [27-Apr-2011 12:00:01] [disconnected at Wed Apr 27 12:00:01 2011] [27-Apr-2011 12:00:02] [connected at Wed Apr 27 12:00:02 2011] [27-Apr-2011 12:00:16] [zenoss-logger (logger bot) has joined #zenoss] [27-Apr-2011 12:00:19] &lt;kokey&gt; rmatte: do you guys have a 24/7 NOC&#160; where you work?

[27-Apr-2011 12:02:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; there is a zMaxMonitorPort or&#160; something that defaults to 1024 [27-Apr-2011 12:02:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to hike it up higher [27-Apr-2011 12:03:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; let me get the exact name [27-Apr-2011 12:03:08] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; i'm monitoring port 53 [27-Apr-2011 12:03:13] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; i dont think i should have to&#160; bump that up?

[27-Apr-2011 12:05:25] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; no [27-Apr-2011 12:05:29] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; because i want to see it alert&#160; down [27-Apr-2011 12:05:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; It doesn't work that way, it needs&#160; to first see the port as up while modelling to monitor it properly [27-Apr-2011 12:05:53] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; and even tho nothing is running&#160; on port 53 TCP, it says it's up [27-Apr-2011 12:06:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; how did you set that to be&#160; monitored?

[27-Apr-2011 12:06:56] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; i just now [27-Apr-2011 12:07:06] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; zenoss still thinks 53 TCP is&#160; up [27-Apr-2011 12:07:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; try running zenstatus manually&#160; after a restart [27-Apr-2011 12:07:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, I'm pretty sure that doing the&#160; add ipservice option doesn't work [27-Apr-2011 12:07:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need it to actually pick up an&#160; open port during a model for it to monitor it properly [27-Apr-2011 12:07:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; so open a port on that server, and&#160; model [27-Apr-2011 12:07:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; then take the port down [27-Apr-2011 12:08:02] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; ok i'll go through that [27-Apr-2011 12:08:05] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; but let me ask you this [27-Apr-2011 12:08:11] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; we have our servers being&#160; remodeled nightly - is that a bad idea? [27-Apr-2011 12:08:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, that's fine, just make sure&#160; you lock certain things, like IP Services [27-Apr-2011 12:08:29] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; nm, i guess it should just be&#160; locked and it shouldn't be an issue [27-Apr-2011 12:08:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; don't lock everything though [27-Apr-2011 12:08:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; some stuff like filesystems,&#160; interfaces, etc... should be remodeled regularly [27-Apr-2011 12:08:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; to pick up any changes [27-Apr-2011 12:08:56] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; *nod* [27-Apr-2011 12:09:03] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; only thing i've locked thus far&#160; are interface speeds [27-Apr-2011 12:09:10] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; and well, this damn thing [27-Apr-2011 12:09:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; the interface speeds should come&#160; from the device itself [27-Apr-2011 12:09:37] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; i understand, but often times&#160; they're reported incorrectly which is why i set them and lock them [27-Apr-2011 12:09:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; how do you go about setting them?

[27-Apr-2011 17:58:53] &lt;nyeates&gt; community zenpacls are on github&#160; only [27-Apr-2011 17:59:03] &lt;nyeates&gt; zenoss core is on svn [27-Apr-2011 17:59:09] &lt;nyeates&gt; not moving [27-Apr-2011 17:59:12] &lt;zykes-&gt; :/ [27-Apr-2011 17:59:28] &lt;nyeates&gt; i need to learn me some git:-) [27-Apr-2011 17:59:43] &lt;zykes-&gt; why not move it ?

Probably would be&#160; an undertaking and also would need to have staff relearn a lot [27-Apr-2011 18:00:22] &lt;nyeates&gt; just guesses tho [27-Apr-2011 18:02:15] &lt;nyeates&gt; I think there is a stronger use&#160; case for git on communtity plugins, because your dealing with more of a&#160; distributed use case [27-Apr-2011 18:02:29] &lt;nyeates&gt; where as core, your not. we take&#160; modifications to core more through bug fixes and patches [27-Apr-2011 18:03:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm that sucks, can't specify&#160; Zenoss variables in SNMP strings [27-Apr-2011 18:03:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wanted to have the last octet&#160; come from ${here/instance} [27-Apr-2011 18:18:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, now to pimp this IPSLA pack&#160; up, I figure that I can get it to use zenperfsnmp instead of the scripts&#160; that it uses right now, which will make it way more efficient. [27-Apr-2011 18:19:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; why the author didn't do that in&#160; the first place is beyond me [27-Apr-2011 18:32:51] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; heh [27-Apr-2011 18:32:53] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; never know... [27-Apr-2011 18:33:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; he used a property called&#160; "instance" instead of snmpindex... [27-Apr-2011 18:33:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm adding an snmpindex property&#160; to it right now [27-Apr-2011 18:33:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; once I get that done, in theory,&#160; zenperfsnmp should work for it [27-Apr-2011 18:33:34] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmattizing it [27-Apr-2011 18:33:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; indeed [27-Apr-2011 18:33:41] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; who made it?

[27-Apr-2011 18:34:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup, that's it [27-Apr-2011 18:34:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think it's the only pack he's&#160; made [27-Apr-2011 18:34:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; he made it back in 2009, I think&#160; he may have abandoned it, not sure [27-Apr-2011 18:34:33] &lt;nyeates&gt; OHHH shane [27-Apr-2011 18:34:37] &lt;nyeates&gt; he is with rackspace now [27-Apr-2011 18:34:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah [27-Apr-2011 18:34:57] &lt;nyeates&gt; new employee there i think....he&#160; might have one other zenpack...not sure tho [27-Apr-2011 18:35:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; He also didn't have all of the&#160; possible IPSLA types defined in the modeler [27-Apr-2011 18:35:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; so instead of getting type "Echo" I&#160; got "1" [27-Apr-2011 18:35:37] &lt;nyeates&gt; i can get u in touch with him if u&#160; want [27-Apr-2011 18:35:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I went in and defined all of&#160; the types [27-Apr-2011 18:35:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, I'm good for now, but I'll&#160; definitely be contacting him in the near future [27-Apr-2011 18:36:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; If he's not interesting in&#160; converting the pack to 3.1 I'll take it on myself for the contest [27-Apr-2011 18:36:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; shouldn't be overly difficult [27-Apr-2011 18:36:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; interested* [27-Apr-2011 18:36:36] &lt;nyeates&gt; good deal [27-Apr-2011 18:36:44] &lt;nyeates&gt; double zenoss shtuff :-) [27-Apr-2011 18:36:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; there we go, got snmpindex in&#160; there [27-Apr-2011 18:37:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; I want the plush Zenny! lol [27-Apr-2011 18:37:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; now to see if snmpindex is all I&#160; needed to use zenperfsnmp [27-Apr-2011 18:37:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it is, huzzah! [27-Apr-2011 18:38:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm using the pack against 38&#160; different IPSLA tags and it's blowing up the system from the CPU load [27-Apr-2011 18:38:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol [27-Apr-2011 18:38:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; need to tone it down [27-Apr-2011 18:39:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha, it works [27-Apr-2011 18:39:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; awesome [27-Apr-2011 18:42:58] &lt;JohnnyNoc&gt; anyone have an idea of how i&#160; could get the firmware revision of an expansion card?

[28-Apr-2011 11:08:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; Hackman238: that's fine, I'm good&#160; with just deving/testing for now [28-Apr-2011 11:08:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; until it's more polished [28-Apr-2011 11:08:16] &lt;Hackman238&gt; rmatte: The new version has&#160; its own daemon to handle all the work. It only works with V3, but only&#160; for GUI reasons. Easily back portable. [28-Apr-2011 11:08:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; Ah, I see [28-Apr-2011 11:08:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd definitely be doing a backport [28-Apr-2011 11:08:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; since I'm still running 2.5 in&#160; prod [28-Apr-2011 11:08:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; haven't had time to properly plan&#160; and execute an upgrade [28-Apr-2011 11:09:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; Well... either that or I can just&#160; continue the route I was going with 2.5, making it work with zenperfsnmp&#160; for now [28-Apr-2011 11:09:26] &lt;Hackman238&gt; rmatte: Shouldn't be too hard.&#160; My customers run 2.5.2 and 3.0, but the demand for IPSLA lies with the&#160; 3.0 customers. [28-Apr-2011 11:09:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah [28-Apr-2011 11:10:05] &lt;gwb235&gt; to go from 2.5.2 to 3.1 do we have&#160; to do a "mini-jump" to 3.0 or can we go straight to 3.1 ? [28-Apr-2011 11:10:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; gwb235: straight [28-Apr-2011 11:10:39] &lt;gwb235&gt; that's what i figured, but the&#160; install docs didn't have that listed IIRC [28-Apr-2011 11:10:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; 3.1 isn't really a new release...&#160; it's just a bugfix for 3.0.x [28-Apr-2011 11:10:48] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Also, if anyone is interested,&#160; I have a zenpack comming up to handle configuring multiplication of,&#160; load balancing, and failover of zopes from inside the webui [28-Apr-2011 11:11:41] &lt;fragfutter&gt; Hackman238: scary [28-Apr-2011 11:11:51] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Makes for very responsive and&#160; robust webUI and its very very safe [28-Apr-2011 11:12:00] * Simon4 runs many zopes, it's great [28-Apr-2011 11:12:16] &lt;Hackman238&gt; I've implemented it here at&#160; rackspace everywhere, and its working great. [28-Apr-2011 11:12:18] &lt;Simon4&gt; improves response times in the UI&#160; heaps with multiple users [28-Apr-2011 11:13:00] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Absolutely, additionally, it&#160; prevents zope lockup due to stupid users who hold F5 or create&#160; multi-graph reports with over 9000 items [28-Apr-2011 11:13:27] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Plus failover so you can&#160; restart individual zopes with out people having a fit. [28-Apr-2011 11:14:09] &lt;nyeates&gt; gwb235: you can go straught from&#160; 2.5.2 to 3.1, but its not tested. Technically, go from 2.5.2 to 3.0.3 to&#160; 3.1 [28-Apr-2011 11:14:17] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Sticky sessions is a must,&#160; however, to minimize duplicate caching and duplicate sessions. [28-Apr-2011 11:14:21] &lt;nyeates&gt; depends how much risk you want to&#160; take [28-Apr-2011 11:14:50] kocolosk|away is now known as kocolosk [28-Apr-2011 11:15:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; Hackman238: that pack only works&#160; with enterprise I take it? [28-Apr-2011 11:15:30] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Negative. Will work with core&#160; too. [28-Apr-2011 11:16:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; Is there any manual setup required&#160; for zope? [28-Apr-2011 11:16:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; or all UI based? [28-Apr-2011 11:16:32] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Negative. All webUI after&#160; zenpack install and its post operations. [28-Apr-2011 11:16:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool, 3.x specific I take it? [28-Apr-2011 11:17:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I really need to upgrade my Zenoss&#160; instances lol [28-Apr-2011 11:17:09] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; me too [28-Apr-2011 11:17:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; but first I need the time to get&#160; the LDAP auth working [28-Apr-2011 11:17:13] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Negative, 2.5.x specific, but&#160; portable to 3.x. [28-Apr-2011 11:17:24] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; rmatte: not working in 3? [28-Apr-2011 11:17:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; then it's going to probably be a 7&#160; hour change to do all my upgrades [28-Apr-2011 11:17:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; Hackman238: ah cool [28-Apr-2011 11:17:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: not yet... the process&#160; to get it working is a lot different than it was in 2.5 [28-Apr-2011 11:18:05] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; oh. how about in enterprise? [28-Apr-2011 11:18:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; Sam-I-Am: enterprise is different,&#160; you have that lovely ZenPack that does it for you [28-Apr-2011 11:18:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol [28-Apr-2011 11:18:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; speaking of which, I'm fairly&#160; certain I could throw together a community ZenPack to do the same [28-Apr-2011 11:19:28] &lt;Hackman238&gt; More zopes =&#160; better so long&#160; as 1) users are trapped on a specific zope by cookie using sticky&#160; sessions and 2) caching is set reasonable so you do not run out of ram&#160; and 3) users dont expire cookies intentionally to get most free threads&#160; or specify port in url. [28-Apr-2011 11:19:57] &lt;Hackman238&gt; LDAP auth can be fun....even&#160; with the ent. zenpack. [28-Apr-2011 11:20:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I got it running perfectly in&#160; my 2.5 instances [28-Apr-2011 11:20:22] &lt;nyeates&gt; LDAP was never productized, and&#160; it needs to be [28-Apr-2011 11:20:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; just need to sort out installation&#160; of the plugin [28-Apr-2011 11:20:38] &lt;themactech&gt; I got LDAP working on 3.1 no&#160; prob [28-Apr-2011 11:20:42] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ldap is kinda hackey even in&#160; enterprise [28-Apr-2011 11:20:46] &lt;themactech&gt; using ubuntu 10.1 server [28-Apr-2011 11:21:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; themactech: the problem with me is&#160; that most of my Zenoss servers are 8.04, which means old system python&#160; libraries [28-Apr-2011 11:21:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the new LDAP plugin isn't&#160; really cooperating. [28-Apr-2011 11:21:27] &lt;themactech&gt; Yeah I gave up on ubuntu&#160; running 2.4 python doing LDAP auth [28-Apr-2011 11:21:34] &lt;themactech&gt; So easy once you are running&#160; python 2.6 [28-Apr-2011 11:21:38] &lt;themactech&gt; very few steps [28-Apr-2011 11:21:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; speaking of which, I threw&#160; together an upgrade script to move them from 8.04 to 10.04, I really&#160; should run that soon [28-Apr-2011 11:22:00] &lt;Hackman238&gt; I agree with Sam-I-Am. Zenoss&#160; issues way too many auth queries, even with auth failure. Results in&#160; potiential lockout in the event of 3 strikes and your out LDAP auth&#160; policy. [28-Apr-2011 11:22:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; probably 2 days worth of upgrades&#160; to do, and they can only be done during our weekly change window, going&#160; to take forever [28-Apr-2011 11:22:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; indeed [28-Apr-2011 11:22:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think I'll do one next week, so&#160; make sure it goes well [28-Apr-2011 11:22:30] &lt;themactech&gt; In my case though I&#160; authenticate to Apple OD servers [28-Apr-2011 11:22:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; then continue with one a week&#160; until they're all done [28-Apr-2011 11:22:35] &lt;themactech&gt; Have to try with AD soon [28-Apr-2011 11:23:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; themactech: AD works fine from&#160; what I hear... I just authenticate against OpenLDAP [28-Apr-2011 11:24:18] &lt;themactech&gt; Yeah AD would give me more&#160; options, with OD, since apple uses posix groups, the LDAP plugin doesn't&#160; support it so I can't do group assignments.&#160; Some guy has a patch for&#160; the python ldap plugin but I don't know how to apply.&#160; It allows the&#160; python ldap plugin to handle posix groups [28-Apr-2011 11:29:17] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; Hackman238: i havent figured out&#160; why its so chatty... and not sure the ram cache helps much. [28-Apr-2011 11:29:24] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; Hackman238: my sysadmin has&#160; gotten a bit pissed about it [28-Apr-2011 11:31:40] &lt;nyeates&gt; There is a fix posted for too&#160; many AD auth request... i poseted it to forum and still working with&#160; hackman to get it fixed on his implement....it has worked countless&#160; other times elsewhere tho. Should be fixed in 3.0 [28-Apr-2011 11:32:00] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Hackman238: Same here. My&#160; admin doesnt care, but instead, my NOC users end up with a locked SSO&#160; which prevents work and creates chaos. [28-Apr-2011 11:34:38] &lt;nyeates&gt; LDAP Auth Fail Fix:&#160; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../message/58080.html#58080">message/58080#58080</a><span> [28-Apr-2011 11:35:50] &lt;nyeates&gt; While we have devs here, any&#160; questions specific to them? [28-Apr-2011 11:37:43] &lt;Hackman238&gt; I'm sure I'll think of some&#160; later. LOL [28-Apr-2011 11:38:24] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Have to run- must interview a&#160; guy. Later all; rmatte-I'll PM you the Zenpack this weekend. [28-Apr-2011 11:41:57] &lt;nyeates&gt; Curiosity question. Anyone here&#160; using public "cloud" services for any infrastructure? Any Internal&#160; "cloud" (self service infra)? [28-Apr-2011 11:43:04] &lt;nyeates&gt; I know Netflix moved to Amazon&#160; for much of their infra.... curious to see if others are making any&#160; moves [28-Apr-2011 11:45:11] &lt;nyeates&gt; *crickets* - guess not [28-Apr-2011 11:45:21] &lt;Sashness&gt; my company has been interested&#160; in moving towards cloud for certain things but not a full fledge move [28-Apr-2011 11:45:23] &lt;Sashness&gt; at least not yet [28-Apr-2011 11:45:43] &lt;nyeates&gt; yeah, well, that is case with&#160; most movers i think [28-Apr-2011 11:45:57] &lt;nyeates&gt; have you looked at any&#160; technologies or vendors yet? [28-Apr-2011 11:46:16] &lt;Sashness&gt; biggest issue we have is we made&#160; a pretty big investment in hardware/infrastructure which will be&#160; rendered moot [28-Apr-2011 11:46:28] &lt;Sashness&gt; i don't think someone wants to&#160; justify that part of it. lol [28-Apr-2011 11:46:50] &lt;Sashness&gt; we've looked at using&#160; ec2/rackspace/vmware via terremark [28-Apr-2011 11:46:56] &lt;nyeates&gt; your existing resources wont be&#160; made moot if you make your own self-service or hybrid cloud that can&#160; burst to public [28-Apr-2011 11:47:11] * fragfutter wonders what it will cost to by a&#160; petabyte of storage in a cloud </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/> [28-Apr-2011 11:47:21] &lt;nyeates&gt; terremark bought by verizon [28-Apr-2011 11:47:52] &lt;Sashness&gt; yeah exactly nyeats. what we&#160; want to do is use something like euclyptis so we can be somewhat vendor&#160; agnostic and can still use our own virtual infrastructure in house [28-Apr-2011 11:47:59] &lt;Sashness&gt; frag: lol too much [28-Apr-2011 11:48:06] &lt;nyeates&gt; petabye, what is that in TBs? [28-Apr-2011 11:48:14] &lt;Sashness&gt; 1000 TB i believe [28-Apr-2011 11:48:33] &lt;Sashness&gt; 1024 TB [28-Apr-2011 11:49:35] &lt;nyeates&gt; $105,000 to just get 1PB of data&#160; into the cloud :-)...nm getting it out and using it [28-Apr-2011 11:50:02] &lt;Sashness&gt; haha [28-Apr-2011 11:50:46] &lt;nyeates&gt; sash: check on cloud.com compared&#160; to eucalyptus - i think its based off openstack/rackspace [28-Apr-2011 11:51:01] &lt;themactech&gt; damn, i feel inadequate,&#160; largest SAN we built is 254TB [28-Apr-2011 11:51:18] &lt;nyeates&gt; wow, that is pretty large [28-Apr-2011 11:51:23] &lt;Sashness&gt; nyeates: ohh cool. thanks. will&#160; check it out [28-Apr-2011 11:51:40] &lt;akafritz&gt; howdy folks.&#160; does anyone here&#160; utilize the community zenpak SQL Data Source? [28-Apr-2011 11:52:46] &lt;themactech&gt; We are now testing in our lab&#160; building a SAN with the new Promise and Rorke Chassis, with a StorNext&#160; MDC instead of Apple's XSAN, since they yanked their xserves [28-Apr-2011 11:53:05] &lt;themactech&gt; All that will have to be&#160; monitored by Zenoss [28-Apr-2011 11:53:44] &lt;nyeates&gt; Interesting, how will you do that&#160; monitoring themactech? [28-Apr-2011 11:54:10] &lt;themactech&gt; I have made modelers for Apple&#160; OS X and for the old Promise VTrak chassis [28-Apr-2011 11:54:33] &lt;themactech&gt; Not where I want them to be&#160; yet, still have to figure out how to do custom components in modelers [28-Apr-2011 11:55:00] &lt;themactech&gt; but since SNMP monitoring is&#160; part time for me, I get into it, make progress then have to work on&#160; something else for a few months... [28-Apr-2011 11:55:08] &lt;themactech&gt; Have to build a holodeck now [28-Apr-2011 11:55:16] &lt;themactech&gt; always busy never bored [28-Apr-2011 11:59:59] &lt;jrh0090&gt; Honestly I have no idea how to&#160; that, I can totally ask around though [28-Apr-2011 12:00:01] [disconnected at Thu Apr 28 12:00:01 2011] [28-Apr-2011 12:00:02] [connected at Thu Apr 28 12:00:02 2011] [28-Apr-2011 12:00:17] [zenoss-logger (logger bot) has joined #zenoss] [28-Apr-2011 12:01:19] &lt;nyeates&gt; themactech: i asked jrh if he&#160; knew about custom components for modelers [28-Apr-2011 12:02:03] &lt;jrh0090&gt; and I asked kells <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> [28-Apr-2011 12:02:49] &lt;nyeates&gt; I think this will mark the end of&#160; our Dev session. Thanks everyone! [28-Apr-2011 12:06:32] &lt;themactech&gt; Jane's paper is my best lead [28-Apr-2011 12:06:41] &lt;themactech&gt; Will work on it some more&#160; hopefully this weekend [28-Apr-2011 12:12:26] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; Have I missed it all???? [28-Apr-2011 12:12:42] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; yep :/ [28-Apr-2011 12:12:49] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; not much happened though [28-Apr-2011 12:22:04] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; any comment on the idea that&#160; the "big draw" to update ZenPacks is now down to a T-shirt plus a Zenny&#160; zeebra? [28-Apr-2011 12:23:02] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; Has anyone there used the&#160; Predictive Threshold ZenPack????? [28-Apr-2011 12:23:18] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; I have updated it for Zenoss 3&#160; and I am looking for testers [28-Apr-2011 12:27:51] &lt;][ceman&gt; Is there a meathod for updating&#160; the OS Manufacturer with the Linux flavor using SNMP? [28-Apr-2011 12:28:13] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; nope [28-Apr-2011 12:28:16] &lt;][ceman&gt; I saw some zenpacks that do it&#160; using SSH, which I might test out [28-Apr-2011 12:28:22] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; get to put those in manually&#160; unless they come with the zenpacks [28-Apr-2011 13:00:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; ][ceman: That's not even exposed&#160; via SNMP, so it's not possible with a default net-snmp agent as far as&#160; I've seen [28-Apr-2011 13:01:48] * rmatte shakes fist at whoever had the bright&#160; idea of downgrading our internet circuit here [28-Apr-2011 13:03:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; I put in an order (supposedly) to&#160; have my UVerse switched from 12Mb to 18Mb for the same cost [28-Apr-2011 13:03:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; a week ago [28-Apr-2011 13:03:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; nothing' [28-Apr-2011 13:03:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; s chagned <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><span> [28-Apr-2011 13:04:26] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ugh, uverse [28-Apr-2011 13:08:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; I hate AT&amp;T less than I hate&#160; Comcast [28-Apr-2011 13:12:33] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; at least comcast doesnt hand you&#160; private address space (or didnt used to) [28-Apr-2011 13:13:08] &lt;joko_&gt; interesting [28-Apr-2011 13:29:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; AT&amp;T are brutal to deal&#160; with... [28-Apr-2011 13:29:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I dealt with them a lot back when I&#160; was a network analyst [28-Apr-2011 13:30:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; "Please do NOT test this data&#160; circuit!" - an hour later, circuit drops off... [28-Apr-2011 13:30:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; call them and sure enough, they&#160; were testing it [28-Apr-2011 13:32:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; Or go through a week worth of&#160; nightly testing to finally have them admit that the problem is with&#160; their equipment, not the customer's [28-Apr-2011 13:32:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; then again that's not unique to&#160; AT&amp;T [28-Apr-2011 13:32:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; BT Ireland is actually the worst&#160; carrier I've ever dealt with (well, the worst that actually spoke&#160; english) [28-Apr-2011 13:33:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; Telmex is the worst (carrier in&#160; mexico) [28-Apr-2011 13:33:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you don't really expect much&#160; from a mexican carrier anyways [28-Apr-2011 13:34:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; Having to call a translation&#160; service every time you call a carrier gets quite tedious [28-Apr-2011 13:36:28] &lt;fassil&gt; Hi All . .

[28-Apr-2011 16:16:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct [28-Apr-2011 16:17:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you could do dev.ipAddress or&#160; whatever [28-Apr-2011 16:17:07] &lt;d-rock&gt; OK [28-Apr-2011 16:17:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; though that's pointless since&#160; evt.ipAddress exists too [28-Apr-2011 16:17:13] &lt;d-rock&gt; The docs are a bit confusing there [28-Apr-2011 16:17:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; use evt as much as possible [28-Apr-2011 16:17:24] &lt;d-rock&gt; Yeah [28-Apr-2011 16:17:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; a use for dev would be something&#160; like... [28-Apr-2011 16:17:39] &lt;d-rock&gt; I just want to suppress events for&#160; pre-production [28-Apr-2011 16:17:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; for i in dev.os.interfaces(): [28-Apr-2011 16:17:44] &lt;d-rock&gt; Although there' [28-Apr-2011 16:17:47] &lt;d-rock&gt; Right [28-Apr-2011 16:18:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; that would be evt.ProdState I&#160; believe [28-Apr-2011 16:18:14] &lt;d-rock&gt; One other request from my customer&#160; is to do event transforms based on the Location that a given device is&#160; in, but that looks not so easy [28-Apr-2011 16:18:19] &lt;d-rock&gt; Yup [28-Apr-2011 16:18:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; if evt.ProdState &lt; 1000: [28-Apr-2011 16:18:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; would suppress anything lower than&#160; production [28-Apr-2011 16:18:46] &lt;d-rock&gt; Right [28-Apr-2011 16:19:10] &lt;d-rock&gt; OK, makes more sense. I had&#160; written a modeler plugin a week or so ago and I think I had zope DB&#160; objects on the brain <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> [28-Apr-2011 16:19:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; (I'm doing this off the top of my&#160; head, so might be slightly off with the property name) [28-Apr-2011 16:19:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah [28-Apr-2011 16:19:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; transforms are pretty simple in&#160; comparison [28-Apr-2011 16:19:37] &lt;d-rock&gt; That's good for me <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> [28-Apr-2011 16:19:43] &lt;d-rock&gt; Thanks for the clarification! [28-Apr-2011 16:19:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe [28-Apr-2011 16:19:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; no problem [28-Apr-2011 16:20:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; aha, it's evt.prodState [28-Apr-2011 16:20:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was close [28-Apr-2011 16:20:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you go to settings you can see&#160; the translations from prod state number to name [28-Apr-2011 16:20:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; Production:1000 [28-Apr-2011 16:20:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; Pre-Production:500 [28-Apr-2011 16:20:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; Test:400 [28-Apr-2011 16:20:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; Maintenance:300 [28-Apr-2011 16:20:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; Decommissioned:-1 [28-Apr-2011 16:20:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can actually add your own in&#160; too if necessary [28-Apr-2011 16:21:08] &lt;d-rock&gt; Yeah, I saw those there, just&#160; missed correlating that when I looked at the event detail [28-Apr-2011 16:22:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe [28-Apr-2011 16:22:42] &lt;d-rock&gt; One more quick question vis-a-vis&#160; transform code: "re" is already imported, right? I don't have to import&#160; that manually? [28-Apr-2011 16:23:11] &lt;d-rock&gt; I mean, I could always "import re"&#160; at the start of the transform, I guess... [28-Apr-2011 16:24:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; you have to import re, at least in&#160; my experience [28-Apr-2011 16:24:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; but try not to overuse re... the&#160; code I wrote was back when I had bad habbits... [28-Apr-2011 16:24:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're better off to do... [28-Apr-2011 16:24:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; if evt.device == "ottawa": [28-Apr-2011 16:24:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; or for a partial match: if&#160; "ottawa" in evt.device: [28-Apr-2011 16:25:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's lower intensity than using&#160; regex [28-Apr-2011 16:25:29] &lt;d-rock&gt; OK, although I'm trying to match&#160; "ip .* is down" <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> [28-Apr-2011 16:25:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah [28-Apr-2011 16:25:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; that makes sense then [28-Apr-2011 16:25:55] &lt;d-rock&gt; I guess I could use whatever the&#160; python equivs to startsWith and endsWith are, together [28-Apr-2011 16:26:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; although if the mapping is&#160; actually against /Status/Ping, you could really just do: if "is down" in&#160; evt.summary: [28-Apr-2011 16:26:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; you won't have any other events&#160; coming in as /Status/Ping anyways [28-Apr-2011 16:26:40] &lt;d-rock&gt; True [28-Apr-2011 16:26:54] &lt;d-rock&gt; OK, now that I've actually saved&#160; the thing, where did it go? [28-Apr-2011 16:27:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha [28-Apr-2011 16:27:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; ? [28-Apr-2011 16:27:40] &lt;d-rock&gt; I just entered the transform and&#160; hit save, but if I want to edit it, where would I find it? [28-Apr-2011 16:28:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; well it depends on where you&#160; entered it in [28-Apr-2011 16:28:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; was it an event mapping? [28-Apr-2011 16:28:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; or was it against an actual class? [28-Apr-2011 16:28:20] &lt;d-rock&gt; Good question [28-Apr-2011 16:28:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol [28-Apr-2011 16:28:35] &lt;d-rock&gt; Well [28-Apr-2011 16:28:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; You need to be concious of where&#160; you're putting your transforms [28-Apr-2011 16:28:51] &lt;d-rock&gt; Now you tell me <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/> [28-Apr-2011 16:29:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; what did you click on to get to&#160; the spot where you were entering it? [28-Apr-2011 16:29:09] &lt;d-rock&gt; I just went to "Event Classes" and&#160; did "transform" there [28-Apr-2011 16:29:56] &lt;d-rock&gt; OK [28-Apr-2011 16:29:57] &lt;d-rock&gt; I get it [28-Apr-2011 16:30:01] &lt;d-rock&gt; One transform per class [28-Apr-2011 16:30:24] &lt;d-rock&gt; I just did the same thing and&#160; voil&Atilde;&iexcl;, code [28-Apr-2011 16:30:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, you literally applied your&#160; transform against the / class [28-Apr-2011 16:31:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; there are 2 types of transforms...&#160; the ones applied against actual classes, and the ones applied as&#160; mappings [28-Apr-2011 16:31:28] &lt;d-rock&gt; Yeah [28-Apr-2011 16:31:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; the majority you'll want to do as&#160; mappings, but for some system events (like ping, or thresholds) you'll&#160; want to do it against the class. [28-Apr-2011 16:31:41] &lt;d-rock&gt; I want to apply to the whole&#160; /perf/SNMP and /perf/ping classes, right? [28-Apr-2011 16:31:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, you want /Status/Ping class [28-Apr-2011 16:31:53] &lt;d-rock&gt; Maybe I should explain what I'm&#160; going for [28-Apr-2011 16:31:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; k [28-Apr-2011 16:31:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; shoot [28-Apr-2011 16:32:01] &lt;d-rock&gt; Doh, that's what I meant [28-Apr-2011 16:32:37] &lt;d-rock&gt; OK, the network I'm monitoring has&#160; specific devices that should be on the network, but as part of their&#160; workflow they want to add them ahead of time to ZenOSS [28-Apr-2011 16:32:56] &lt;d-rock&gt; So they just want to avoid *any*&#160; display for pre-production devices [28-Apr-2011 16:33:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's not just about blocking&#160; alerts, you literally want all events for pre-prod devices to be&#160; ignored? [28-Apr-2011 16:33:31] &lt;d-rock&gt; With the default settings, they&#160; don't see *status* for the pre-prod devices, but they do see hundreds of&#160; events about the devices not being reachable [28-Apr-2011 16:33:33] &lt;d-rock&gt; Bingo [28-Apr-2011 16:33:38] &lt;d-rock&gt; Well [28-Apr-2011 16:33:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; Ok, that's easy... [28-Apr-2011 16:33:40] &lt;d-rock&gt; Not all alerts [28-Apr-2011 16:33:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh [28-Apr-2011 16:33:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; so just ping and snmp agent down&#160; alerts? [28-Apr-2011 16:33:56] &lt;d-rock&gt; They want to get an alert if one&#160; of the devices comes up [28-Apr-2011 16:34:01] &lt;d-rock&gt; Right [28-Apr-2011 16:34:15] &lt;d-rock&gt; Because technically a device&#160; shouldn't be live until they've gone through some setup [28-Apr-2011 16:34:29] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Why not just place them in&#160; maintenance prod state? [28-Apr-2011 16:34:31] &lt;d-rock&gt; So in this case down is the new up&#160; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> [28-Apr-2011 16:34:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's what maintenance&#160; production state is designed for [28-Apr-2011 16:34:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; to continue polling the device but&#160; suppress all alerts [28-Apr-2011 16:35:09] &lt;d-rock&gt; But would that allow me to alert&#160; someone if a device comes up? [28-Apr-2011 16:35:37] &lt;Hackman238&gt; then create transform for if&#160; prodstate is maint. and device is now up, alert + eventcommant&#160; device.setProdState to production [28-Apr-2011 16:35:41] &lt;d-rock&gt; I use maintenance windows heavily&#160; for things and they work great, but my understanding is that it&#160; basically suppresses everything [28-Apr-2011 16:35:49] &lt;d-rock&gt; Hmmm [28-Apr-2011 16:36:12] &lt;d-rock&gt; Now that I think about it, would&#160; it better to create a new state specifically for this use case? They&#160; might want to use an actual maintenance state for maintenance [28-Apr-2011 16:36:37] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Can even condition it more by&#160; adding all these devices to a system or group called 'pre-populated' or&#160; soemthing. [28-Apr-2011 16:36:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh [28-Apr-2011 16:36:59] &lt;Hackman238&gt; That way other maint. devices&#160; don't trigger that transform [28-Apr-2011 16:37:02] &lt;d-rock&gt; Being able to control this by&#160; putting it into a Location would be ideal [28-Apr-2011 16:37:10] &lt;d-rock&gt; Or a group [28-Apr-2011 16:37:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; just create a custom production&#160; state [28-Apr-2011 16:37:32] &lt;d-rock&gt; Actually [28-Apr-2011 16:37:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; Pre-Populated:501 [28-Apr-2011 16:37:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; then: if evt.prodState == 501: [28-Apr-2011 16:38:09] &lt;d-rock&gt; OK, right [28-Apr-2011 16:38:15] &lt;d-rock&gt; evt._action = 'drop', right? [28-Apr-2011 16:38:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; and to alert when a device comes&#160; up, you'd have to use the clear events to trigger that [28-Apr-2011 16:38:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I'm not sure how well that'll&#160; work if you're suppressing the down events [28-Apr-2011 16:38:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never tried anything like&#160; that [28-Apr-2011 16:38:56] &lt;d-rock&gt; Well [28-Apr-2011 16:39:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; Why wouldn't you just put it in a&#160; pre-prod, configure your alerting rules not to alert on anything other&#160; than production... [28-Apr-2011 16:39:28] &lt;d-rock&gt; It wouldn't be as simple as&#160; evt.severity = 5 ? [28-Apr-2011 16:39:28] &lt;joko_&gt; nice convo [28-Apr-2011 16:39:39] &lt;joko_&gt; i need to start making my server&#160; build guys do t hat [28-Apr-2011 16:39:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; and have a transform that changes&#160; the summary from ip blah is down to "Pre-Prod: ip blah is down" [28-Apr-2011 16:39:44] &lt;d-rock&gt; When they explained what they&#160; wanted to do I had to have them explain it twice <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><span> [28-Apr-2011 16:39:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; and when the message dissapears,&#160; you know the device is up [28-Apr-2011 16:40:19] &lt;d-rock&gt; The other feature they're asking&#160; for is even more fun [28-Apr-2011 16:40:33] &lt;d-rock&gt; They want to get alerts when&#160; autodiscovery finds IPs not already in ZenOSS [28-Apr-2011 16:40:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can do evt.severity = 5 for&#160; sure... but you only want that to apply to specific situations [28-Apr-2011 16:40:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; you wouldn't want that for&#160; production events [28-Apr-2011 16:40:56] &lt;d-rock&gt; No [28-Apr-2011 16:41:03] &lt;d-rock&gt; This would all be under the same&#160; filter [28-Apr-2011 16:41:08] * rmatte nods [28-Apr-2011 16:43:18] &lt;d-rock&gt; So, something like&#160; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://gist.github.com/947293">https://gist.github.com/947293</a><span> [28-Apr-2011 16:43:35] &lt;d-rock&gt; With a similar transform for&#160; /Status/SNMP [28-Apr-2011 16:47:40] &lt;d-rock&gt; Cool, I'm going to test some of&#160; this out.

[29-Apr-2011 16:31:49] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i'm more of a network nerd... so&#160; getting zenoss to correctly understand my network gear was the big&#160; thing [29-Apr-2011 16:31:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss is a big part of my job,&#160; but I do support other systems here [29-Apr-2011 16:32:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; now i have it talking to a&#160; variety of gear [29-Apr-2011 16:33:12] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Cool.

We do mostly&#160; network and some servers. [29-Apr-2011 16:39:18] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; some internal servers, dns,&#160; working on a small vm hosting environment [29-Apr-2011 16:39:35] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; mostly foundry and juniper&#160; gear... some cisco. [29-Apr-2011 16:41:09] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Yeah, we're mostly a cisco&#160; place. We're starting to monitor more and more VM, I imagine we'll build&#160; out more since we're pushing cloud use. [29-Apr-2011 16:41:43] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; nexus? [29-Apr-2011 16:42:25] &lt;Hackman238&gt; It's hard though, we cant&#160; monitor everything. We've tens of thousands of network devices alone. [29-Apr-2011 16:42:42] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; wow, thats... insane [29-Apr-2011 16:43:10] &lt;Hackman238&gt; No nexus, as far as I know. [29-Apr-2011 16:43:13] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i know how zenoss can sprawl...&#160; just monitoring inbound/outbound traffic on one interface is 2 RRD files [29-Apr-2011 16:43:22] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; disk i/o became the problem here [29-Apr-2011 16:43:32] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; monitoring traffic, errors, and&#160; packets per second on each interface [29-Apr-2011 16:44:04] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; someday we'll get rrdcached [29-Apr-2011 16:46:17] &lt;Hackman238&gt; We avoid disk i/o issues by&#160; using Fusion I/O storage in all our collectors [29-Apr-2011 16:46:40] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; heh... if i suggested that to&#160; the sysadmin here he'd laugh for a long time [29-Apr-2011 16:46:54] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the problem with being mostly a&#160; network shop is the budget for systems stuff is miniscule [29-Apr-2011 16:47:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; even when it involves monitoring&#160; the network stuff [29-Apr-2011 16:48:49] &lt;Hackman238&gt; You could do what I did for NY&#160; state's OFT Zenoss- [29-Apr-2011 16:49:21] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Large GFS2 cluster to&#160; distribute reads and writes across many, many RAID 10's [29-Apr-2011 16:49:46] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; wheeee [29-Apr-2011 16:50:07] &lt;Hackman238&gt; That way you can use&#160; inexpensive hardware [29-Apr-2011 16:50:31] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; still requires purchasing&#160; something [29-Apr-2011 16:50:44] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; management has to get over the&#160; hurdle that this will not be free [29-Apr-2011 16:50:54] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; so in the end i had to scale&#160; things back a bit, but we're moving along [29-Apr-2011 16:52:38] &lt;Hackman238&gt; You should ask the following&#160; of management: Just how important is the monitoring data? If we miss a&#160; hikkup will it cost us more money than if we just invested in proper&#160; monitoring? [29-Apr-2011 16:53:23] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i've done that... we specialize&#160; in providing reliable service, so you can't skimp on the one system that&#160; performs monitoring [29-Apr-2011 16:53:28] &lt;Hackman238&gt; A good example is OFT and&#160; Rackspace. [29-Apr-2011 16:53:47] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; what i got was "well, its open&#160; source... its free... it should work on any old hardware we throw at&#160; it... and you're good enough to make it all work" [29-Apr-2011 16:53:53] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Rackspace invests in our&#160; monitoring to ensure fanatical service and support. We often fix&#160; problems before customers even know. [29-Apr-2011 16:54:16] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; thats the goal here [29-Apr-2011 16:54:28] &lt;Hackman238&gt; NYS OFT, on the other hand,&#160; assumes that the viability of the entire states network is 'only so&#160; important' in comparrison to say...union bennifits. [29-Apr-2011 16:55:32] &lt;Hackman238&gt; So here at RackSpace, our&#160; Zenoss is engineered to be 'the best'. At OFT, well, I had to engineer&#160; it to make use of the crap they had lying around because there wasn't&#160; enough money in the multi-billion dollar NYS budget. [29-Apr-2011 16:55:44] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; lol [29-Apr-2011 16:56:03] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; my company provides service to&#160; mostly state educational organizations, so... that might explain a bit. [29-Apr-2011 16:56:30] &lt;Hackman238&gt; What's the name of your&#160; company again? [29-Apr-2011 16:56:40] &lt;Simon4&gt; Sam-I-Am: collect IO/bw numbers&#160; for the RRD reads/writes, then sell it to them like a bandwidth upgrade&#160; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> there's only so much data you can jam onto a spindle in a short space&#160; of time [29-Apr-2011 16:56:54] &lt;Simon4&gt; they should understand those&#160; numbers since they invest in network hardware [29-Apr-2011 16:57:45] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Simon4: Good way to convey the&#160; need to 'differtly' minded management. [29-Apr-2011 16:58:26] * Simon4 had to do that to justify the large&#160; raid10 arrays for our collectors [29-Apr-2011 16:59:59] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Yep. [29-Apr-2011 17:01:07] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; Hackman238: kanren.net [29-Apr-2011 17:02:31] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; Simon4: done and done :/ [29-Apr-2011 17:03:41] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Sam-I-Am: Its to bad they&#160; won't listen. Sorry to hear the situation. [29-Apr-2011 17:04:02] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Gotta run. TTYL [29-Apr-2011 17:04:11] &lt;Simon4&gt; Sam-I-Am: <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><span> that really sucks [29-Apr-2011 17:04:18] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; Hackman238: seeya [29-Apr-2011 17:04:47] &lt;Simon4&gt; if you can get mysql onto another&#160; machine (even a small one) you'll gain some more breathing room [29-Apr-2011 17:05:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; right now mysql lives on&#160; different storage than the RRDs [29-Apr-2011 17:05:07] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i got that much [29-Apr-2011 17:05:10] &lt;Simon4&gt; cool [29-Apr-2011 17:07:42] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; one of these days it might be&#160; nice to get involved with a bigger zenoss operation [29-Apr-2011 17:07:50] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; moar hardware! [29-Apr-2011 17:08:34] &lt;Simon4&gt; it's fun [29-Apr-2011 17:09:19] * Simon4 is keen to do another decent sized&#160; zenoss project, I'll need to move jobs to do it though [29-Apr-2011 17:11:04] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; same here [29-Apr-2011 17:12:37] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; one thing i will not do again is&#160; be on-call [29-Apr-2011 17:12:48] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; i've spent the last 10 years&#160; on-call [29-Apr-2011 17:13:11] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its not bad when its your own&#160; stuff, but i rely so heavily on other telcos who can't make their shit&#160; work [29-Apr-2011 17:14:40] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, I'm on-call atm, but haven't&#160; been for years before now [29-Apr-2011 17:14:51] &lt;Simon4&gt; and it's only for our stuff, which&#160; we get to make good, so callouts are very rare [29-Apr-2011 17:15:31] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; not being able to go anywhere or&#160; do anything or sleep for a week at a time just isnt fun anymore [29-Apr-2011 17:16:00] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; its not as bad here as a&#160; previous job (where you really did not sleep at all for a week), but&#160; still irritating and not worth it.&#160; dont get any extra money either. [29-Apr-2011 17:22:59] &lt;moath&gt; wtf...trying to add an event class&#160; to a zenpack and no zenpacks show up in the list :/ [29-Apr-2011 17:23:12] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; did you create the zenpack&#160; first? [29-Apr-2011 17:23:19] &lt;moath&gt; yea, it's an existing one [29-Apr-2011 17:23:24] &lt;moath&gt; i'm using it to schlep my rules&#160; between zenoss servers [29-Apr-2011 17:23:35] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; it generally will not list&#160; zenpacks which you did not create yourself [29-Apr-2011 17:23:37] &lt;moath&gt; rules/classes/etc. [29-Apr-2011 17:23:51] &lt;moath&gt; hmmm...it was created in house but&#160; it wasn't created on this server [29-Apr-2011 17:23:59] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; might have a compatibility issue&#160; of some kind [29-Apr-2011 17:24:02] &lt;moath&gt; i can add stuff to it from other&#160; areas though [29-Apr-2011 17:24:07] &lt;moath&gt; same version of zenoss on all my&#160; servers [29-Apr-2011 17:24:21] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; thats a bit odd [29-Apr-2011 17:24:40] &lt;moath&gt; well [29-Apr-2011 17:24:41] &lt;moath&gt; hmm [29-Apr-2011 17:25:06] &lt;moath&gt; i can add monitoring templates to&#160; it because I'm able to type the name of the zenpack in manually through&#160; it's dialog box [29-Apr-2011 17:25:13] &lt;moath&gt; the one for the event classses&#160; don't give me that option [29-Apr-2011 17:28:14] kocolosk is now known as kocolosk|away [29-Apr-2011 17:30:23] &lt;Simon4&gt; moath: if it wasn't created on&#160; that server it won't be in "development mode" which means you can't add&#160; things to it [29-Apr-2011 17:30:37] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ahh thats what i was trying to&#160; remember [29-Apr-2011 17:31:26] &lt;Simon4&gt;&#160; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="DOC-10094.html">docs/DOC-10094</a><span> [29-Apr-2011 17:31:32] &lt;Simon4&gt; you can convert it however </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> [29-Apr-2011 17:42:58] &lt;moath&gt; Simon4: badass, thanks [29-Apr-2011 17:43:06] &lt;Simon4&gt; sweet as [29-Apr-2011 17:49:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the demo went well and&#160; there's interest here now [29-Apr-2011 17:50:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; now it's just getting the quote&#160; and going from there [29-Apr-2011 17:53:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; woohoo!

[30-Apr-2011 20:58:06] &lt;sloof3&gt; Why might my bps graph be missing&#160; data points but my pps graph isn't? [30-Apr-2011 20:59:02] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; check the logs from zenperfsnmp [30-Apr-2011 21:00:38] &lt;sloof3&gt; Is that available through the GUI&#160; or the server console?

[30-Apr-2011 21:10:04] &lt;ryker22&gt; I am using Raid 10 across 6&#160; spindles [30-Apr-2011 21:10:31] &lt;ryker22&gt; I setup the box with 100 GB for /&#160; and 300 GB for /opt [30-Apr-2011 21:12:07] &lt;ryker22&gt; DOes that sound reasonable to you&#160; for a 500 device monitor? [30-Apr-2011 21:12:27] &lt;sloof3&gt; Sam-I-Am: All I see for the host&#160; in question is a number of "oid .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.X.X.X.X is bad" [30-Apr-2011 21:13:05] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; sloof3: if that oid has worked&#160; before, might be a problem polling the device... or polling is taking&#160; too long. [30-Apr-2011 21:14:03] &lt;Carlton&gt; I"ve done some research on&#160; Zenoss, but haven't installed. What Linux distro would you suggest for a&#160; linux newbie? [30-Apr-2011 21:15:13] &lt;ryker22&gt; RHEL if you can pay for it.&#160; You&#160; get support then and have someone to turn to for help. [30-Apr-2011 21:15:26] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ryker22: depends on how many RRD&#160; files each device creates.&#160; hard to tell if you dont calculate it.&#160; i'd&#160; create one device... see what it uses, then make your new filesystem [30-Apr-2011 21:15:42] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; ryker22: the easiest route would&#160; probably be centos or rhel [30-Apr-2011 21:15:43] &lt;ryker22&gt; CentOS if you want it free.&#160; That&#160; is just my opinion.&#160; I am new to Zenoss but know linux well [30-Apr-2011 21:16:01] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; debian works too with just a bit&#160; more work [30-Apr-2011 21:16:24] &lt;ryker22&gt; Sam-I-AM... thanks!&#160; I will do&#160; just that and figure it out. [30-Apr-2011 21:17:49] &lt;sloof3&gt; Sam-I-Am: Must be intermittent&#160; polling problem...weird [30-Apr-2011 21:23:06] &lt;sloof3&gt; Sam-I-Am: I take that back.&#160; The&#160; logs ware referring to an interface that wasn't the interface I see the&#160; problem on [30-Apr-2011 21:24:22] &lt;Carlton&gt; Thanks, I've played with CentOS&#160; before so I'll probably try that. Any good tutorials/videos on Zenoos&#160; setup/config with CentOS?l [30-Apr-2011 21:26:25] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; the docs for zenoss more or less&#160; work with rhel/centos [30-Apr-2011 21:26:30] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; at least the install procedure [30-Apr-2011 21:26:31] &lt;Sam-I-Am&gt; (rpm) [30-Apr-2011 21:27:06] &lt;Carlton&gt; .bin install for us newbies?
