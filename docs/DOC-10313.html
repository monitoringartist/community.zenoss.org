Gat0rvean: and your snmp polls for CPU usage should not really see it show up in the average<br/>[04-May-2011 08:56:13] &lt;kokey&gt; but yeah, depends on the equipment<br/>[04-May-2011 08:56:46] &lt;Gat0rvean&gt;

since you can do a command, you can monitor _anything_ you want<br/>[19-May-2011 03:57:03] &lt;forsberg&gt; you can make a small shell/perl/whatever script that returns number of files and you can graph it<br/>[19-May-2011 03:57:03] &lt;forsberg&gt; and make alerts bases on threshold<br/>[19-May-2011 03:57:08] &lt;alib0b0&gt; I mean, I have a sever centralized all log I have<br/>[19-May-2011 03:57:29] &lt;alib0b0&gt; and now I want zenoss monitor that directory (contain log)<br/>[19-May-2011 03:57:36] &lt;alib0b0&gt; is it ok ?<br/>[19-May-2011 03:57:46] &lt;hmp&gt; what do you want to monitor? changes to the log file?<br/>[19-May-2011 03:58:18] &lt;alib0b0&gt; I want to monitor all the event in the log files<br/>[19-May-2011 03:58:27] &lt;alib0b0&gt;

thats not efective, try inotify for monitoring<br/>[19-May-2011 03:59:39] &lt;forsberg&gt; sure, anything you can do in a prompt you can make output a way that you would be able to monitor in zenoss<br/>[19-May-2011 04:00:03] &lt;forsberg&gt; but there is no out of the box solution for this i think in zenoss<br/>[19-May-2011 04:00:04] &lt;forsberg&gt; only windows event log <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[19-May-2011 04:00:36] &lt;alib0b0&gt;

also, depends of what you are trying to monitor, have a look at zensyslog also<br/>[19-May-2011 04:04:00] &lt;alib0b0&gt; ok, thanks hmp &amp; forsberg, I 'll try<br/>[19-May-2011 04:04:53] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt;

I know you already have this log - whast architecture is it and what is in it?<br/>[19-May-2011 04:07:08] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; Could you arrange for these log messages to go instead / as well to either a Windows event log or a unix syslog?<br/>[19-May-2011 04:07:20] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; Then you get your events into zenoss for free<br/>[19-May-2011 04:10:18] &lt;alib0b0&gt; We have some server to manage<br/>[19-May-2011 04:10:49] &lt;alib0b0&gt; now, we have centralized all log from those server to a log server (use rsyslog)<br/>[19-May-2011 04:11:17] &lt;fragfutter&gt;

get alert from the log files I have centralized<br/>[19-May-2011 04:12:40] &lt;alib0b0&gt; I have used splunk, It 's good but the licence quite expensive<br/>[19-May-2011 04:12:59] &lt;fragfutter&gt; alib0b0: that's why you configure an _additional_ forward in your central syslog server. All logfiles will stay there, splunk can do anything that it wants to do with it. But also zenoss will receive them.<br/>[19-May-2011 04:15:15] &lt;alib0b0&gt; fragfutter: ok, I have done that. But I want to know is there any way to set zenoss monitoring a specific folder<br/>[19-May-2011 04:15:55] &lt;fragfutter&gt; as mister spock would say: Insuccificent data does not compute<br/>[19-May-2011 04:16:45] &lt;fragfutter&gt; what do you mean by monitoring a specific folder.

which is ridiculous<br/>[24-May-2011 11:40:58] &lt;jmp242&gt; A year right<br/>[24-May-2011 11:41:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; a year, yes<br/>[24-May-2011 11:41:02] &lt;lthrasher&gt; but tivoli et al keep working if you don't renew your maintenance<br/>[24-May-2011 11:41:04] &lt;jmp242&gt; not even buy in with 20% maintenance<br/>[24-May-2011 11:41:14] &lt;jmp242&gt; that's the other big thing<br/>[24-May-2011 11:41:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; and that $80,000 was after a supposed 20% discount<br/>[24-May-2011 11:41:32] &lt;jmp242&gt; we *might* pay a "large" (for us, which is much less than that) buy in<br/>[24-May-2011 11:41:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; though they did eventually lower the price to the point where we will be considering it again in about a year<br/>[24-May-2011 11:41:49] &lt;jmp242&gt; with the standard sort of maintenance costs<br/>[24-May-2011 11:42:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wish they'd be more flexible in the sense that... I don't want nor need support from them, yet it's a forced inclusion in the price<br/>[24-May-2011 11:42:17] &lt;jmp242&gt; The main issue for us is that we went with Core because it's free<br/>[24-May-2011 11:42:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; same with the large number of enterprise Zenpacks which I'd never use<br/>[24-May-2011 11:42:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; they don't offer any form of modular pricing<br/>[24-May-2011 11:42:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's all or nothing<br/>[24-May-2011 11:42:45] &lt;jmp242&gt; That's true<br/>[24-May-2011 11:42:55] &lt;jmp242&gt; I've posted before about the pricing being kind of crazy<br/>[24-May-2011 11:42:56] &lt;lthrasher&gt; rmatte: they're at the five-year mark with the investors, so flexibility isn't something they can really afford.<br/>[24-May-2011 11:43:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; lthrasher: well, it would be nice to see them get there eventually<br/>[24-May-2011 11:43:20] &lt;jmp242&gt; I thought they had a LOT of customers even at that price though<br/>[24-May-2011 11:43:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; They claim to be a cheaper alternative to the big 4... but with pricing like that it doesn't cost much more to just go with one of the big 4 lol<br/>[24-May-2011 11:43:56] &lt;lthrasher&gt; show of hands: enterprise customers who have renewed at least one time<br/>[24-May-2011 11:44:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; lthrasher: I'm sure the majority do<br/>[24-May-2011 11:44:41] &lt;jmp242&gt; But I do think that if they want customers, they need to make the minimum buy in around 5% of that, and have it not be per monitored device I think. It doesn't cost a lot to run a webstore for software licenses w/out the support<br/>[24-May-2011 11:44:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; lthrasher: once you get over the hurdle of justifying the pricing then it's not a big deal<br/>[24-May-2011 11:45:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; jmp242: that per device thing is killer for smaller to medium sized businesses...<br/>[24-May-2011 11:45:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's great for huge companies like rackspace with devices in the tens of thousands<br/>[24-May-2011 11:46:21] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Zenoss does indeed need to rework pricing for small and medium businesses.<br/>[24-May-2011 11:46:59] &lt;jmp242&gt; Well - I would expect per device would be a killer all around myself<br/>[24-May-2011 11:46:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; In contrast, we're monitoring those same 1009 devices in Solarwinds and we're paying them $12,000/year<br/>[24-May-2011 11:47:04] &lt;jmp242&gt; I much prefer site licenses<br/>[24-May-2011 11:47:22] &lt;jmp242&gt; Soo much easier to deal with the licensing / renewal<br/>[24-May-2011 11:47:31] &lt;jmp242&gt; even if it cost more than say the exact amount I have now<br/>[24-May-2011 11:48:14] &lt;lthrasher&gt; free software without a community / enterprise divide and available renewable support is even easier to deal with <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[24-May-2011 11:48:24] &lt;jmp242&gt; Well, yes<br/>[24-May-2011 11:48:44] &lt;jmp242&gt; I think the divide as it *was* where enterprise got you zenpacks<br/>[24-May-2011 11:48:47] &lt;jmp242&gt; works fine for me<br/>[24-May-2011 11:49:00] &lt;jmp242&gt; I.e. you're buying plugins seems fine for both sides<br/>[24-May-2011 11:49:14] &lt;jmp242&gt; but changing out the guts seems to lose a lot of benefit to me for both sides<br/>[24-May-2011 11:49:35] &lt;jmp242&gt; i.e. we can hire someone to code a zenpack on Core<br/>[24-May-2011 11:49:43] &lt;jmp242&gt; but that can benefit enterprise customers<br/>[24-May-2011 11:49:58] &lt;jmp242&gt; third parties could probably even sell their own zenpacks<br/>[24-May-2011 11:49:59] &lt;lthrasher&gt; i suspect zenoss eng feels the same but is getting overruled by the bottom-line watchers.<br/>[24-May-2011 11:51:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; lthrasher: I don't see how they are doing anything other than making lots of money right now.&#160; They have some big companies as customers.<br/>[24-May-2011 11:52:16] &lt;lthrasher&gt; rmatte: unless / until the IPO, all we can do here is speculate<br/><span>[24-May-2011 11:52:17] &lt;eric256&gt;

but i'm a skeptic.<br/>[24-May-2011 11:54:22] &lt;jmp242&gt; One of the great things about zenoss is / was the community and extensibility etc<br/>[24-May-2011 11:54:34] &lt;jmp242&gt; but yes, you can get some great monitoring tools that are closed source for a lot less<br/>[24-May-2011 11:55:05] &lt;lthrasher&gt; a skeptic who has a meeting to get to... ta!<br/>[24-May-2011 11:55:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; lthrasher: The thing is, like I said, this is nothing new... they've done stuff like this before<br/>[24-May-2011 11:55:23] &lt;lthrasher&gt;

PRTG is for instance&#160; 4700 for a unlimited node monitored system<br/>[24-May-2011 11:56:38] &lt;jmp242&gt; and I think it does a lot more OOTB<br/>[24-May-2011 11:56:54] &lt;lthrasher&gt; rmatte: about two years, but i'm not nearly as dedicated to keeping up with happenings as you are.<br/>[24-May-2011 11:57:01] &lt;lthrasher&gt;

Matt used to fight tooth and nail to try to keep as many features in Core as possible.&#160; I'm not sure if Nick is doing the same or not.<br/>[24-May-2011 11:57:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; He may be<br/>[24-May-2011 11:57:35] * rmatte shrugs<br/>[24-May-2011 11:58:12] &lt;jmp242&gt; yea<br/>[24-May-2011 11:58:57] &lt;jmp242&gt; Zenoss should be careful, the community does bring in a lot of customers, builds a good third party ecosystem (look at Jane Curry + Skills 1st for instance)<br/>[24-May-2011 11:59:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; jmp242: There's also the community ZenPacks<br/>[24-May-2011 11:59:22] &lt;jmp242&gt; but if you kill that off with making many differences between CORE and Enterprise .&#160; . .<br/>[24-May-2011 11:59:28] &lt;rmatte&gt;

one void that we still need filled is vmware monitoring (which Eric Enns was working on)<br/>[24-May-2011 12:04:12] &lt;jmp242&gt; Mmmm...<br/>[24-May-2011 12:04:46] &lt;jmp242&gt; What is relstorage supposed to do (i.e. why would the community want to do a Zenpack to add that in)?<br/>[24-May-2011 12:05:00] &lt;rmatte&gt;

We buy enterprise Zenoss for the mere fact we must have a supported product. If Zenoss were to close source or branch core- it would limit inernal development and open us to consider other products.<br/>[26-May-2011 11:36:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think that there's a lot of room for improvement with that.<br/>[26-May-2011 11:37:45] &lt;Hackman238&gt; rmatte: Yeah I like the way bkarpovich hasn't commented on my questions or remarks.<br/>[26-May-2011 11:38:10] &lt;jmp242&gt; Per what rmatte is saying - where I work we have a budget that would be pretty easy to get to buy a zenpack or two at the $500-$2k mark<br/>[26-May-2011 11:38:45] &lt;jmp242&gt; or to purchase a one off support call at the $300 range or so much per hour, but not at an 8hr minimum commitment etc<br/>[26-May-2011 11:38:58] &lt;bkarpovich&gt; Hackman238:&#160; will definitely comment on your points....<br/>[26-May-2011 11:39:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; One of the big things with the pricing is that it includes full support and all ZenPacks, whether you like it or not.&#160; Beyond logging enterprise bug tickets, we wouldn't need any type of support as I already know the product inside and out.&#160; We'd also only need select ZenPacks.&#160; With the current pricing model we'd be paying to support code and features that we don't use.<br/>[26-May-2011 11:39:02] &lt;jmp242&gt; I want to get across that I'm not looking to be a leach or looking for handouts<br/>[26-May-2011 11:39:04] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; jmp242 - but who "suppports" your chargeable zenpack?<br/>[26-May-2011 11:39:12] &lt;jmp242&gt; the community<br/>[26-May-2011 11:39:20] &lt;jmp242&gt; or we buy a support pack or something<br/>[26-May-2011 11:39:34] &lt;jmp242&gt; the idea here is that we can buy LOTS of software without a support commitment from lots of vendors<br/>[26-May-2011 11:39:41] &lt;jmp242&gt; i.e. the support is extra<br/>[26-May-2011 11:39:56] &lt;jmp242&gt; we can also get, from MS for instance, packs of 2 or 4 support calls for a price we could afford<br/>[26-May-2011 11:39:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; Yeh, bundling of support is what kills the price<br/>[26-May-2011 11:40:05] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; and of course one option is to support it yourself<br/>[26-May-2011 11:40:09] &lt;jmp242&gt; right<br/>[26-May-2011 11:40:15] &lt;Hackman238&gt; bkarpovich: I want you to know I look at this problem from the perspective of a rep for a large customer, a business man, a community developer and a consultant with many Zenoss contracts- please don't take anything I say as malice, it's just my perspective.<br/>[26-May-2011 11:40:32] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; and the ebenfit of a strong community is that you get lots of help<br/>[26-May-2011 11:40:45] &lt;bkarpovich&gt; all -- unfortunately, I need to jump out.&#160;&#160; thanks for the initial discussion.&#160; please keep it going.&#160; Nick will bring this all back and we'll directly address in the coming weeks.<br/>[26-May-2011 11:40:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; The price of the code itself should cover the maintenance and development of the code... but if I'm not going to be calling the support team there, then why am I chipping in for their salaries?<br/>[26-May-2011 11:40:52] &lt;jmp242&gt; We've been doing great with Core and no support.
