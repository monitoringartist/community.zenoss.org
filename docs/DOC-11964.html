so that's calling _setProperty in the object itself?</p><p>[04-Jul-2011 09:48:03] &lt;fragfutter&gt; amorphic: as far as i see it without running a pdb session. The webinterface calls setZPropertyInfo, which calls _setProperty.&#160; using dmd to call setZenProperty also results in calling _setProperty.</p><p>[04-Jul-2011 09:49:26] &lt;amorphic&gt; Excuse my ignorance, but what's a pdb session?</p><p>[04-Jul-2011 09:49:50] &lt;fragfutter&gt;

yeah, that's getting a bit beyond my current knowledge of Zenoss + Zope</p><p>[04-Jul-2011 09:51:47] &lt;amorphic&gt; But if I can't find another way around the problem I guess I'll have to learn</p><p>[04-Jul-2011 09:52:04] &lt;fragfutter&gt; interesting i can't toggle monitord inside the webinterface at all.</p><p>[04-Jul-2011 09:52:06] &lt;amorphic&gt; It's a bit disappointing though, this doesn't seem to me like something that should be complicated</p><p>[04-Jul-2011 09:52:19] &lt;amorphic&gt;

ugh, lots of commands</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 14:44:14] &lt;gloin&gt; it did time out though</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 14:44:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you need to increase the timeout some more</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 14:44:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I assure you that that's the timeout value that it uses</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 14:45:03] &lt;gloin&gt; fair enough</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 14:46:00] * gloin runs the command in question a few times with "time" to see what is a good value</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 14:46:24] &lt;gloin&gt; actually, the zencommand timeout value is for all zencommands per cycle or per each zencommand?</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 14:53:30] &lt;jmp242&gt; I believe it's for each zencommand . . .</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:02:19] &lt;rmatte&gt;

the value returned by SNMP is 0 but you end up with 0.00023</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:23:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; or whatever</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:23:32] &lt;Hackman238&gt; kerick: What do you mean?</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:27:21] &lt;kerick&gt; we have some windows servers on vmware that drop their cpu states</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:27:59] &lt;kerick&gt; zenoss seems to pickup the percentage correctly, but changes the graph to reflect the current speed</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:28:04] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: is that value from rrd or from the logs?</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:28:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; kerick: does that actually make a difference to the OS?&#160; I didn't think it did</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:28:10] &lt;kerick&gt; rrd</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:28:18] &lt;kerick&gt; ...oh, sorry</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:28:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: that's what is showing up in the graph</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:28:22] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: because rrd interpolates the data</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:28:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: yet when I do zenperfsnmp run or snmpwalk directly on the OID the value is 31</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:28:43] &lt;rocket&gt; eg if you enter data between steps it attempts to guess the value it should be</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:28:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, lameness</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:29:00] &lt;rocket&gt; thats an rrdism</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:29:01] &lt;kerick&gt; rmatte: the OS doesn't really care, but zenoss seems to change the maximum of the graph to the current speed.</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:29:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I should also mention that it's a derive</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:29:04] &lt;rocket&gt; cant turn it off</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:29:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; but if it sees 30 one cyle and 31 the next you'd think you'd end up with 1</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:29:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; not with 1.00074</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:29:32] &lt;rocket&gt; its a trend line</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:29:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; lame</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:29:45] &lt;rocket&gt; it thinks its going up via the calculated trend line</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:30:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; the other thing I can't understand is this queue that I'm monitoring, when it goes up by 1 or 2 the derive doesn't reflect the change</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:30:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just end up with a larger 0 integer</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:38:54] &lt;gloin&gt; larger 0 integer...</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:39:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; as in 0.00023 then 0.00064</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:39:44] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte its the rate of change between the old value and the new value at the step</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:40:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's not the literal change between them?</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:40:08] &lt;rocket&gt; no</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:40:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; what would calculate the literal change?</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:40:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; absolute?</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:40:43] &lt;rocket&gt; GAUGE</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:41:02] &lt;rocket&gt; derive and absolute are rate of change and units are X/sec</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:41:14] &lt;rocket&gt; eg used in networking graphs</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:41:21] &lt;rocket&gt; bits/s etc</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:41:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, I get what you mean</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:41:48] &lt;rocket&gt; GAUGE stores the value itself</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:42:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, but what I want is the exact difference between cycles</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:42:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; instead of it graphing that I have 181 emails queued, I want to see that the queue has gone up or down by a certain amount since the last collection</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:42:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; (not over time)</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:42:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; there must be some way to do that</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:44:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually hmmm, since it's over time I wonder if I can just use an RPN and multiply by 300 to accomplish that</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:44:31] &lt;rocket&gt; probably</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:44:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll give it a go</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:44:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; thanks for the explanation, I wasn't thinking about it properly</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:45:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; aha</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:45:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; that did it</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:45:15] &lt;rocket&gt; no problem .. <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/></p><p>[07-Jul-2011 15:45:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; sweet deal, thanks</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 16:21:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice, RPN expressions actually get applied to associated threshold lines</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 16:21:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I can make the threshold something like 1.0 / 300 and the line shows up where it should according to the RPN that I placed on the graph point</p><p>[07-Jul-2011 17:47:19] &lt;kerick&gt;

And all the windows servers come up with a Hardware Manufacture of Microsoft :/</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:13:47] &lt;xuru&gt; so why display Generic or Microsoft in the overview page under Hardware Manufacturer when it's going to obviously be wrong</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:13:57] &lt;xuru&gt; or is there a way to correct it</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:14:44] &lt;fragfutter&gt; xuru: as the snmp implementation of your systems report a "generic" sysOid there is nothing that zenoss can do.</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:14:46] &lt;xuru&gt;

I got that on one of the other interfaces</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:17:31] &lt;klone&gt; ifOperStatus at 2 means interface down</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:17:48] &lt;fragfutter&gt; xuru: you need a modeller that detects if the device is a Dell server, and then sets the HWTag of the device.</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:19:49] &lt;xuru&gt; fragfutter: I understand what you are saying, but that would mean I would need fore knowledge that it is actually a Dell machine...&#160;&#160; It would think that zenoss would be able to do this automatically.</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:21:12] &lt;fragfutter&gt; xuru: i repeat it for you, the sys-oid of a net-snmp installation is generic. there is no way from a normal probe to detect which hardware the net-snmp is running on.</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:21:46] &lt;fragfutter&gt; xuru: if you want to automaticly discover it, you need to probe the various manufacturers oids.</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:21:56] &lt;xuru&gt; exactly</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:22:05] &lt;xuru&gt; so why doesn't it?</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:22:11] &lt;xuru&gt; for the most common</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:22:44] &lt;fragfutter&gt; xuru: because you could just hang the modeller of your choice in there and they will do it for you.</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:23:21] &lt;fragfutter&gt; xuru: install the dellmon pack, add the modeller delldevicemap to all your servers, if it detects a dell oid it will modify your hw product.</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:23:33] &lt;fragfutter&gt; xuru: if it doesn't detect one it won't modify it.</p><p>[14-Jul-2011 12:24:40] &lt;xuru&gt;

dhopp: You can, but you cant include custom schema items in the objects.xml as far as I know.</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:44:12] &lt;dhopp&gt; Hackman238:&#160; so I assume this means some writing of python code?</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:44:18] &lt;Evolution&gt; So, by default on a Zenoss install the initial collector is named 'localhost'. Can this be changed/modified ? In the Advanced -&gt; Collectors tab none of the menus seem allow me to modify the collector name</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:44:27] &lt;Evolution&gt; is there some doco on doing this?</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:44:57] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Evolution: It can be done, but not easily. I dont reccomend it.</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:45:37] &lt;Evolution&gt; Hackman238: why should the collector not have a FQDN entry?</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:46:23] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Evolution: For a few reasons, the main being some of the daemons bind to 127.0.0.1</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:47:51] &lt;Evolution&gt; okay, so will this impact having a master -&gt; mutli-collector setup?</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:48:04] &lt;Evolution&gt; each collector will report to localhost, but have an FQDN entery for the master?</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:48:34] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Evolution: Not at all. The local collector will always be localhost. The name of the machine the remotes point to will be the fqdn</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:49:03] &lt;Evolution&gt; okay cool</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:49:13] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Evolution: GL</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:49:15] &lt;Evolution&gt; thanks.</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:49:58] &lt;Evolution&gt; last question, is there a method to programatically delete a monitored machine like there is to add a machine?</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:50:23] &lt;Evolution&gt; I'm basically having my linux servers register themselves with the collector as the last step of their automated installation.</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:50:49] &lt;Evolution&gt; if a machine gets rebuilt, I'd like it to delete the existing entry and all data... then add itself in as&#160; a brand new entry</p><p><span>[20-Jul-2011 09:51:11] &lt;Evolution&gt; basically I'm looking for the opposite of this -&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2353.html">docs/DOC-2353</a></p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:52:05] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Evolution: You can do that using a dmd call or a rest call, but I dont know what it is.

I'll poke at it</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:52:37] &lt;klone&gt; Evolution - yeah, you can do that via REST if you wanted to</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:52:48] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Evolution: rocket may be able to give you a better idea if thats implemented in the rest api or xmlrpc</p><p><span>[20-Jul-2011 09:53:30] &lt;klone&gt; wget --auth-no-challenge ' </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://user:password@ZENOSS_SERVER:8080/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/TEST-DEVICE/deleteDevice">http://user:password@ZENOSS_SERVER:8080/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/TEST-DEVICE/deleteDevice</a><span>'</span></p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:53:41] &lt;JohnnyNOC&gt; anyone here using the WMIPerf and DellMon/HPMon Zenpacks?</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:53:45] &lt;Evolution&gt; klone: at this point it's looking slightly easier to do it via a python script, with db info, as the server doesn't always know everything about itself.</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:53:57] &lt;Evolution&gt; so I'm moving away from REST and into xmlrpc.</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:54:21] &lt;klone&gt; what do you mean?</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:55:24] &lt;Evolution&gt; the clients I'm kickstarting are to be monitored, but I can't trust the data I get from them other than the ip address when they're building.</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:55:46] &lt;klone&gt; ah</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:55:59] &lt;Evolution&gt; the kickstart server generates their information from a database, so I'm adding zenoss to the kickstart server, and using the info in the db about the machine to populate zenoss.</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:57:09] &lt;Evolution&gt; so basically I'm going to iterate through the db to do the initial population, and then park my script at the end of the kickstart server's task list for completion.</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:58:07] &lt;Evolution&gt; they have kind of a complex system here that had 0 monitoring built into it</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 09:58:24] &lt;Evolution&gt; so I'm testing out a few products to see what works. so far zenoss seems to fit</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 10:10:07] kocolosk|away is now known as kocolosk</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 10:10:56] &lt;Guest94635&gt; Morning!</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 10:11:03] &lt;Guest94635&gt; is anyone up for a problem i am having?</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 10:13:40] &lt;klone&gt; sure</p><p>[20-Jul-2011 10:14:11] &lt;Hackman238&gt; Guest94635: Hi Guest94635.

unusual <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/></p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:18:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; johnf1911: there's a dropdown where you can select hourly, weekly, monthly, yearly</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:18:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; select one of those and click reset</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:19:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; as far as selecting a data range, no, you need to scroll back in time by hand using the arrows</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:19:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; date range*</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:20:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; johnf1911: If it's using 32bit counters for 10gig interfaces you're probably monitoring with SNMP v1 instead of SNMP v2</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:20:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the most common cause of that</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:20:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; generally Zenoss is very good at picking up on what interfaces are 64bit</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:20:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; snmp v1 doesn't support 64bit counters though</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:20:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; verify in your zProperties that it's set to use v2, not v1</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:23:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; johnf1911: it's also based on the actual speed set on the interface, if you've manually lowered the speed on the interface, even though it's a TenGigabit, it'll treat it as 32bit</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:23:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; only speeds above 100Mbps qualify</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:25:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; it honestly wouldn't take much for them to add a date range option, not sure why they haven't already done it</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:27:34] &lt;johnf1911&gt; I always override the default to v2c</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:27:37] &lt;johnf1911&gt; and then address issues</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:27:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should just override it at the absolute root of /Devices if you haven't already</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:28:00] &lt;johnf1911&gt; in the past, I used to need to fuck around the the ethernetscamd things</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:28:05] &lt;johnf1911&gt; of course I hvae</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:28:13] &lt;johnf1911&gt; anyways, in the current version</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:28:26] &lt;johnf1911&gt; it does a good job of assigning interface types to gig interfaces and stuff</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:28:44] &lt;johnf1911&gt; but on some cisco switches I have, with TenGig ports mentioned in the interface list</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:29:02] &lt;johnf1911&gt; (thought not actually connected, and no physical module installed)</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:29:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; what's the speed that's detected for the ports though?</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:29:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; via snmp</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:29:16] &lt;johnf1911&gt; it set them up as non-64 bit counters</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:31:46] &lt;johnf1911&gt; IF-MIB::ifSpeed.10201 = Gauge32: 10000000</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:32:16] &lt;johnf1911&gt; hmm, it seems to show that speed for all ports that are down</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:32:28] &lt;johnf1911&gt; so if the port were up, it would probably have the correct speed</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:32:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; strange, I've seen the code for how Zenoss determines whether an interface is 64bit or not and it's basically just: if i.speed &gt;= 1000000</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:33:16] &lt;Hackman238&gt; rmatte: Yep, thats exactly how its done</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:33:36] &lt;johnf1911&gt;

actually yeh, I think speed is in bytes</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:34:27] &lt;Hackman238&gt; johnf1911: At 10g, the counters would roll too often to use 32bit, so thats the point where 64bit counters are required</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:34:30] &lt;johnf1911&gt; IF-MIB::ifSpeed.10501 = Gauge32: 4294967295</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:34:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; since Zenoss does * 8 to speed in certain places</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:34:45] &lt;johnf1911&gt; that's a null interface</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:34:52] &lt;johnf1911&gt; Hackman238: 1Gbit is sufficient for that</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:35:03] &lt;johnf1911&gt; if you go over ~120MBit</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:35:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; so yeh, 10000000 is 10mbit</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:35:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; meaning non-64bit</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:35:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; that'd explain it</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:35:11] &lt;johnf1911&gt; you will have lovely sawtooth action</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:35:14] &lt;johnf1911&gt; yes, it does</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:35:19] &lt;johnf1911&gt; so if it was up, then, on remodel</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:35:23] &lt;johnf1911&gt; it would be adjusted?</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:35:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; &lt;@rmatte&gt; actually yeh, I think speed is in bytes &lt;--- I meant to say bits</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:36:16] &lt;Hackman238&gt; johnf1911: at 1gb, it would take 30 or so seconds</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:36:53] &lt;johnf1911&gt; well, I'll explore the issue in more depth if I ever turn up a tengig interface</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:36:54] &lt;Hackman238&gt; johnf1911: Really should just use 64bit cuonters everywhere possible</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:36:57] &lt;johnf1911&gt; I should probably say when</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:37:13] &lt;johnf1911&gt; zenoss generally does a good job of setting the appropriate interface type</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:37:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; the speed is picked up on remodel</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:37:32] &lt;johnf1911&gt; and there are periodic remodels, right?</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:37:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if you turn one up, do a quick remodel and it should grab the proper speed</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:37:34] &lt;Hackman238&gt; johnf1911: I missed some of the convo, whats the exact problem?</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:37:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, there are</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:37:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think the default remodel is 720 minutes</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:37:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; it can be adjusted</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:37:53] &lt;johnf1911&gt; ten gig interfaces didn't automatically get a 64 bit counter</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:37:58] &lt;johnf1911&gt; but the interface in question wasn't up</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:38:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; the remodel time is right under settings I believe</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:38:08] &lt;johnf1911&gt; and, at least on this specific cisco device</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:38:22] &lt;Hackman238&gt; johnf1911: long as you turn it up and model should be no issue</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:38:29] &lt;johnf1911&gt; that means that it doesn't correctly report it's interface speed</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:38:59] &lt;Hackman238&gt; johnf1911: Though automatic models and manual models have had differing results in some cases here, but its uncommon.</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:39:11] &lt;johnf1911&gt; I don't have the necessary upgrade module or sfp+ to turn it up</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:39:24] &lt;johnf1911&gt; I just wondered at the interface auto-detection</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 11:39:26] &lt;johnf1911&gt;

Yeah.. wil do so</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 14:36:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; quite a few people are still using 2.5.2 in production, which is why some of the packs haven't been updated that quickly</p><p>[25-Jul-2011 14:48:57] &lt;rmatte&gt;

If I bind it right to a device, then they show</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:33:17] &lt;Andrew__&gt; Like everythign today...&#160; frustrating and baffling</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:33:18] &lt;Andrew__&gt; lol</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:33:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, it's possible that you have different bindings under different classes (you probably do), and they override what's set higher up</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:33:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll have to go through class by class and bind it</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:34:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; quicker than binding it individually to every device</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:34:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; try to stay away from changing settings right on devices themselves, it quickly becomes unmanageable</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:34:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; only do it if you absolutely have to</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:34:59] &lt;Andrew__&gt; Yeah this is a new install so I'm trying to make it clean by group</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:35:22] &lt;Andrew__&gt; I only have one monitoring template bound to a class</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:35:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, a lot of classes already have bindings set on them, and binding set on a sub-class always overrides what's set at the /Devices level</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:35:30] &lt;Andrew__&gt; for that thing we just fixed</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:35:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can bind multiple templates</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:35:44] &lt;Andrew__&gt; oh wait</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:36:26] &lt;Andrew__&gt; So if I bind my "SonicWALL" monitoring template to my SonicWALL class and have a device in there...&#160; it removes any monitoring tempaltes bound higher up in the heirarchy?</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:36:30] &lt;Andrew__&gt; such as /Devices?</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:36:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:36:49] &lt;Andrew__&gt; ugh</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:37:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; the reasoning for it is because the template bindings are actually a zProperty</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:37:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; and zProperties set on classes override what's set higher up</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:37:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; the property is zDeviceTemplates</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:38:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; they have an interface to make it easier to manage the bindings so that you don't need to edit the property by hand, though it can be done</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:38:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that's the reason why</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:38:37] &lt;Andrew__&gt; ok so I added fping as a bound template to the SonicWALL class then and it doesnt show still.

yup in there now</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:45:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should then see a data source under that template, I'm guessing a command type datasource</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:45:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; (or possibly more than one?)</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:45:32] &lt;Andrew__&gt; one source, some points under it</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:45:44] &lt;Andrew__&gt; its a command that runs fping program on the box</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:45:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, first the most obvious question to ask... you do actually have fping installed on that box right?</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:45:58] &lt;Andrew__&gt; hehe yes</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:46:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:46:03] &lt;Andrew__&gt; and sed as they say</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:46:07] &lt;Andrew__&gt; compiled fine, no issues</p><p>[27-Jul-2011 20:46:14] &lt;rmatte&gt;

then: if "blah" in groups:</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:54:36] &lt;fritz101&gt; oh ok.&#160; what is the difference?</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:54:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; more precise</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:54:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; what it'll do is break it up in to a list of groups</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:55:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; because in the event you basically have a string like: |/group1|/group2|/group3</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:55:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; by using split with | you end up with a list: ['group1', 'group2', 'group3']</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:55:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually sorry, more like...</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:56:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; ['/group1', '/group2', '/group3']</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:56:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; then when you do the: if "/group2" in groups:</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:56:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll only match if it's exactly /group2</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:56:29] &lt;fritz101&gt; ok.&#160; so then the groups.find isn't necessary?&#160; a simple [if "name" in groups] is good enough?</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:56:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you set groups the way I described, yes</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:57:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll look for exact matches too, so say you have /group2, /group22 and /group222</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:57:04] &lt;fritz101&gt; ok cool.&#160; so the group name needs to be exact?</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:57:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; when usin "in" against a list like that, yes</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:57:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; it doesn't apply when using it against a regular string</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:57:49] &lt;fritz101&gt; this is actually a sub-group.&#160; so its '/toplevel group/sub group' - is that the correct syntax?</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:58:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so you'd literally specify that whole thing</p><p>[29-Jul-2011 11:58:08] &lt;fritz101&gt;
