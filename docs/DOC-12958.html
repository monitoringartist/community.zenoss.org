dhopp, we realize that.&#160; We want to track as much as we can.&#160; We may ignore most of it, but we want it.</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:36:27] &lt;pplask&gt; hello</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:39:19] &lt;SDuensin&gt; Hi pplask</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:39:33] &lt;pplask&gt; im new to zenoss. Im using the template /Server/Linux to monitor a server for testing purposes, to learn how to use zenoss</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:39:53] &lt;pplask&gt; i see that he generates events of high utilization of a network interface</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:40:12] &lt;pplask&gt; i followed some tutorials to make it more human readable (using % values)</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:40:48] &lt;pplask&gt; but i couldnt find a way to set the default value of the interface</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:41:29] &lt;pplask&gt; the speed, i mean</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:41:38] &lt;pplask&gt; because this interface is used for backups for example</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:42:16] &lt;pplask&gt; so it keeps generating events saying that the utilization is 800% of the interface</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:42:29] &lt;dhopp&gt; pplask:&#160; first thing you should do is switch zenoss to using snmp v2c..it defaults to v1</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:43:13] &lt;pplask&gt; and how do i do that?</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:43:54] &lt;dhopp&gt; pplask:&#160; to do that click on Infrastructure-&gt;Device Classes-&gt;Details-&gt;ConfigurationProperties-&gt;zSnmpVer</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:43:57] &lt;dhopp&gt; change it to v2c</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:44:04] &lt;pplask&gt; i see in configuration properties, zsnmpver</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:44:08] &lt;pplask&gt; mmm</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:44:46] &lt;dhopp&gt; after you change that you need to do a couple of things</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:44:52] &lt;pplask&gt; ok but then i will need to change something in the monitored server right?</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:45:10] &lt;pplask&gt; ok, what do i need to do?</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:45:32] &lt;dhopp&gt; zsnmpver by default is inherited from the top level.&#160; Unless you overrode it anywhere else setting it at the Device Class level means all devices will use it</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:45:46] &lt;dhopp&gt; so now log into your zenoss server with ssh</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:46:10] &lt;dhopp&gt; and as the zenoss user rm -rf $ZENHOME/perf/Devices/YOURDEVICENAME</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:46:41] &lt;pplask&gt; ok</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:46:43] &lt;pplask&gt; i did it</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:46:57] &lt;dhopp&gt; then back in the UI you need to remodel the device&#8230;go to the device and click the gear menu in the bottom left and select "Model Device"</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:47:49] &lt;pplask&gt; ok done</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:48:12] &lt;dhopp&gt; this should allow you to use 64bit counters which will make monitoring gigabit cleaner</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:48:34] &lt;dhopp&gt; now clear all events for this device and wait and see if you get the same events</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:49:36] &lt;pplask&gt; ok, but to model i will have to delete always the device from this path?</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:49:48] &lt;dhopp&gt; no</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:50:14] &lt;pplask&gt; ok</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:50:21] &lt;dhopp&gt; we had to do it this time because we changed from v1 to v2c</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:50:47] &lt;dhopp&gt; I'm not 100% if it is necessary but since you only have 1 device it's better to make sure it doesn't cause any other strange issues</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:50:51] &lt;pplask&gt; oh i see, well i have another device here, but i cant find it in .../perf/Devices/</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:51:01] &lt;dhopp&gt; pplask:&#160; what device?</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:51:07] &lt;dhopp&gt; err</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:51:09] &lt;dhopp&gt;

no events</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:51:46] &lt;dhopp&gt; and it shows as up?</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:52:01] &lt;dhopp&gt; pplask:&#160; what happens if you model the device?&#160; Any errors?</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:52:10] &lt;pplask&gt; yes up. no, any erros</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:52:12] &lt;pplask&gt; errors</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:52:15] &lt;pplask&gt; all seems ok</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:53:02] &lt;pplask&gt; is there a way to manually set the interface speed?</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:53:19] &lt;dhopp&gt; pplask:&#160; so you clicked the gear menu and chose "Model Device" and it doesn't say anything like "SNMP timeout on device"?</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:53:28] &lt;dhopp&gt; what do you mean set the interface speed?</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:53:29] &lt;pplask&gt; cos if i want to monitor the bandwidth of internet connection, and be warned if it goes to 75%</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:53:44] &lt;pplask&gt; dhopp, no timeouts, it worked fine</p><p>[04-Oct-2011 11:54:10] &lt;dhopp&gt;

"our existing monitoring system does this, we need to do this"&#8230;nevermind that fact that our existing monitoring system is like 10 years old (no joke, there is comments in the code with the year 2001) and almost everything it can do that Zenoss can't was a custom thing</p><p>[06-Oct-2011 15:37:15] &lt;dhopp&gt;

enkrypt: I've struggled with that same issue with similar cases (individual switches in a stack, etc.).&#160; I think the cleanest solution is to define a new component type and modeler (like how interfaces are handled) - but I haven't figured out how to do that yet</p><p>[19-Oct-2011 08:25:36] &lt;wayne___&gt; enkrypt: the zenpack howto for 2.x had an example using something bridging related (it's been a while so I don't remember exactly what) - but it required hacking up page templates in order to work.&#160;

and the documentation for that simply doesn't work as described</p><p>[19-Oct-2011 09:02:54] &lt;enkrypt&gt; for the httpmonitor story I could in theory literally COPY the template for each URL, but that seems awfully unproductive?</p><p>[19-Oct-2011 09:03:21] &lt;enkrypt&gt; right now I'm planning to simply add a new datasource for each URL to the locally copied template</p><p>[19-Oct-2011 09:05:28] &lt;enkrypt&gt; Hackman238: I've also opened a support ticket for the issue I'm having with the CRITICAL error backtrace in my zenhub.log, talking about exceptions.AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'monitorDevice'</p><p>[19-Oct-2011 09:05:52] &lt;enkrypt&gt;

I temporarily disabled zensyslog (well, I moved it to a different port) and now I get much less heartbeat failures</p><p>[19-Oct-2011 09:09:22] &lt;enkrypt&gt; I'm in the process of installing rsyslog on my servers to listen on 514, do some filtering, and then pass a subset of the syslog traffic onto zensyslog which I've configured to listen on 10514</p><p>[19-Oct-2011 09:09:26] &lt;enkrypt&gt; I hope this will help</p><p>[19-Oct-2011 09:09:40] &lt;enkrypt&gt; but still the errors and tracebacks I keep seeing in zenhub.log worry me</p><p>[19-Oct-2011 09:10:24] &lt;enkrypt&gt; and the fact that any syslog sending server can easily take down my (rather beefy) zenoss installation with a few thousand syslog triggers per minute is a bit scary</p><p>[19-Oct-2011 09:10:42] &lt;Hackman238&gt; enkrypt: Can you post your zenhub.log to pastebin?</p><p>[19-Oct-2011 09:11:25] &lt;Hackman238&gt; enkrypt: Yeah the oracle monitor I've had less than complete success with.
