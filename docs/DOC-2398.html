However none of my Windows boxes are returning any WMI relevant data except the Win Services.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 13:56:30] **klinstifen&gt; does wmiperf use wmic?</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 13:56:34] **cgibbons&gt; you know I haven't used those two community zenpacks before, let me install them so I can speak somewhat more intelligently in regards to them. although you'd think that since the services is working that connectivity is golden.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 13:57:41] **klinstifen&gt; and is your zwinuser typed in as domain\user or domain/user</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 13:58:09] **gemineye&gt; Yes, if it weren't I wouldn't be able to get the Win Service info.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 13:59:20] **klinstifen&gt; i had problems with wmic at one time because i had domain\user and it wanted domain/user</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 13:59:59] **cgibbons&gt; that was probably just a shell escaping issue, klinstifen. </span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:00:04] **gemineye&gt; I have it as domain\user</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:01:15] **gemineye&gt; Also, as we type here, something else really annoying just happened. While I can monitor all the Win Services on a server, there are in many cases over 50 services that are aren't running and core generates critical errors for those. I've disabled monitoring of them but periodically it'll still generate critical events.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:05:33] **cgibbons&gt; got 1 of the 2 zenpacks installed, almost there</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:08:16] **cgibbons&gt; so just to double check, gemineye, you're using a device class that has the WMIPerformanceMonitors and the DeviceWMI_SNMP_v2</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:08:21] **cgibbons&gt; er templates?</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:09:20] **gemineye&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:09:38] **cgibbons&gt; k</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:09:52] **cgibbons&gt; so those call wmic as a command, interesting</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:10:12] **gemineye&gt; How does enterprise call wmi?</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:11:43] **cgibbons&gt; Directly. There is a set of modeling plugins that do WMI for modeling, and then an ZenPack called zenwinperf that does collection of performance counters (perfmon) directly over MS-RPC.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:11:55] **cgibbons&gt; A mix of Python and native code.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:12:35] **cgibbons&gt; wmic uses the same native code for WMI that enterprise uses of course, except provides no perfmon support directly.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:15:33] **cgibbons&gt; adding a device using those templates...</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:16:45] **cgibbons&gt; so for example you don't get any file systems listed, gemineye?</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:17:09] **gemineye&gt; yep, the only thing listed are Win Services, and the graphs under the perf tab are blank too.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:19:36] **cgibbons&gt; hmmm, I think klinstifen's hint is on the right track. it lookks like that zenpack is passing the device username &amp; password properties to its command line-tool and using double-quotes for them instead of single quoes.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:19:41] **cgibbons&gt; so that backslash doesn't get escaped properly.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:19:56] **cgibbons&gt; whereas the built-in service stuff doesn't do it that way so it doesn't have that issue.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:19:59] **gemineye&gt; lets see what happens if I swap it.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:20:01] **cgibbons&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:20:34] **gemineye&gt; Will this mess up other aspects of core's monitoring?</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:20:38] **cgibbons&gt; nope</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:21:00] **cgibbons&gt; windows is pretty agnostic about the direction of that at the internal level</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:21:13] **cgibbons&gt; the enterprise zenpacks also do not pass the username &amp; password on the command-line, which is nice to avoid</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:22:02] **gemineye&gt; remodeling device...</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:22:30] **gemineye&gt; nope, nothing came up, unless it takes a while</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:23:09] **cgibbons&gt; should be instantly after the modeling job runs</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:25:02] **gemineye&gt; Remodeling a 2000 server had no luck, I remodeled a 2003 server too, no luck.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:25:18] **cgibbons&gt; hurm okay, trying to figure out a bit more about these zenpacks. </span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:25:38] **cgibbons&gt; can you go to your device and look at the Collector Plugins setting in the More menu?</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:26:58] **gemineye&gt; brb, gotta talk withmy mgr about monitoring...</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:28:01] **klinstifen&gt; cool, glad the tip helped</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:28:26] **klinstifen&gt; where is the wmiperformancemonitor zenpack?</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:28:34] **klinstifen&gt; it's not in the usual place...unless it has a different name there</span><br/><span><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:29:56] **cgibbons&gt;

I asked him about submitting it for the Community ZenPacks page, I should try again</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:31:27] **klinstifen&gt; i think this zenpack uses python to "grep" stuff</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:32:00] **cgibbons&gt; yeah looks like it</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:32:35] **klinstifen&gt; hey mray, way back i submitted an exchange zenpack but never heard anything about</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:32:49] **mrayzenoss&gt; really?&#160; dang</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:32:52] **klinstifen&gt; i just figured you all didn't want a community exchange zenpack when there is an enterprise exchange zenpack</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:33:03] **mrayzenoss&gt; no way, I don't discriminate</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:33:07] **klinstifen&gt; ok cool</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:33:14] **klinstifen&gt; well then i'll convert it to egg and resubmit</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:33:48] **mrayzenoss&gt;

when i have a chance i'll convert it and try again</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:37:04] **gemineye&gt; any idea why Win Services that are disabled still generate critical events?</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:37:27] **mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, sorry I haven't put up the SiteWindow portlet yet, it didn't work out of the box and I'm juggling a couple of other ones trying to get them to pass my smoke tests</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:37:51] **cgibbons&gt; gemineye, it looks like those two zenpacks don't actually provide any WMI based modeling plugins, unless I'm missing them</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:38:48] **cgibbons&gt; and onto the services, so you've changed the Monitor setting for the Windows Service to False? in the device class or on the device itself?</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:40:51] **gemineye&gt; Device itself</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:45:32] **cgibbons&gt; k moment</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:49:07] **cgibbons&gt; on a side note, I did find this afternoon that we seem to be completely ignoring the zWinEventlog zProperty </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:50:27] **gemineye&gt; Good since I don't even know what that does... unless I read the manual... to lazy.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:51:24] **cgibbons&gt; that's a boolean to disable or enable Event Log monitoring on a Windows device. not something most people disable it looks like, otherwise we would have heard about it sooner.</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:51:27] **gemineye&gt; ok, so if it's ignoring the zProperty, what does it think it is, False or True?</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:51:33] **cgibbons&gt; always true</span><br/><span> [04-Feb-2009 14:51:54] **cgibbons&gt;

good idea..</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 04:49:02] **zarxcky&gt; I do it cos I dont want to burden the zenoss server with the load..</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 04:49:17] **zarxcky&gt; let the client do the job sending event to zenoss instead the reverse</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 04:49:17] **nemo_&gt;

instead the zenoss server doing a hell lot of jobs modeling lots of devices</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 04:56:49] **zarxcky&gt; so I just dont want to add more load to the zenoss server</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 04:57:17] **zarxcky&gt; hence the zensendevent with the bash script on the rsync server do the job sending events to zenoss server</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 04:57:57] **zarxcky&gt; yeah maybe wrong way.. cap'ain!</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 04:58:12] **zarxcky&gt;

I have zenoss monitoring in two places. One is going to go offline, the new one is at a phycially different location. For some reason, a couple of VMs (VMWare) report as down during the middle of the night from the new location. It only appears to be these VMs, all other phsyical servers dont' report these issues. </span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 07:59:15] **C_Kode&gt; The zenoss&#160; that is local to the VMs, doesn't report these issues.</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:00:06] **C_Kode&gt; The latancy is very good between the two locations averaging 4.5 ms response time.</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:43:20] **klinstifen&gt; morning all</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:43:36] **klinstifen&gt; anyone know where the list of OS Products is stored?

It only happens to the VM servers and only when Zenoss server isn't local to them. The latency is about 4.5 ms between the two locations.</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:48:14] **cgibbons&gt; are you monitoring the VMs just like a normal device, or using a specific zenpack?</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:48:36] **C_Kode&gt; Normal device.</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:48:50] **mrcerulean&gt; Good morning, all.</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:49:05] **C_Kode&gt; I beleive. Let me look again. I know I installed some VMware zenpack, but don't think I ever set them up</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:49:15] **cgibbons&gt; hrm, odd. are the VMware tools installed on each guest VM, too?</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:49:34] **mrcerulean&gt; I have a system with a bunch of virtual interfaces. http is running on some, but not all. Because ZenOSS cannot see http on all interfaces, it throws and error. How can I tell it to ignore certain virtual interfaces?</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:49:43] **C_Kode&gt; Hmm..&#160; I believe so, but may need to look.&#160; They are console linux servers.</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:50:12] **cgibbons&gt; i bring that up only because sometimes you get really messed up clock latency issues if you don't, which can affect how timeouts, etc. are handled by that guest.</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:50:27] **cgibbons&gt; might have nothing to do with what you are seeing of course, or might be the cause </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:50:30] **C_Kode&gt; They only have Apache and Device/Server/Linux templates binded to them</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:51:26] **C_Kode&gt; vmware-tools is running</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:52:00] **C_Kode&gt; Actually, they had clock issues before, but I fixed those a few days ago</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:53:11] **cgibbons&gt; k good</span><br/><span> [05-Feb-2009 08:53:43] **C_Kode&gt; I also get SNMP agent down and IP down errors.

oh</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 11:56:42] **cgibbons&gt; likely does</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 11:56:51] **raw__&gt; try creating that events folder</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 11:57:03] **raw__&gt; I remember we had to create 2 organizers before we could install it</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 11:57:38] **cgibbons&gt; bingo. so the first thing I'm going to do is add that device organizer and the event organizer to the zenpack.</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 11:57:39] **raw__&gt; hopefully that pack installs the necessary Mibs</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 11:58:25] **raw__&gt; k cool</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 11:59:37] **raw__&gt; once you're done we should just be able to remove the old pack and install the new one correct?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 11:59:49] **cgibbons&gt; yeah or even just install the new one as an upgrade</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:00:06] **raw__&gt; will both packs still show up in the zenpack list if I do it as an update?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:00:49] **raw__&gt; also, I have a zenpack with like 1200 cisco Mibs packaged in to it, and it takes like 6 hours to install it, if I were to install the same pack as an update (if I added a few things to it) would it just see the differences and skip the Mibs installs bringing the install time down?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:02:01] **cgibbons&gt; hrm I'm not sure how that works in detail actually, it might be faster but I think it will still consult each mib file</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:02:09] **raw__&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:02:10] **raw__&gt; k</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:02:24] **raw__&gt; but it'll only show up once in the zenpacks list?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:02:35] **raw__&gt; like, I won't see Mibpackv1, Mibpackv2, Mibpackv3, and so on?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:04:27] **cgibbons&gt; not positive but pretty sure. when we do zenpack upgrades here we don't have to change anything other than the version # and then write a migrate script if there are any data changes.</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:04:51] **raw__&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:04:52] **raw__&gt; k</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:05:48] **raw__&gt; by the way, do you need the OID values for the memory values?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:07:20] **cgibbons&gt; i will shortly</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:07:31] **cgibbons&gt; right now I've installed the zenpack and i'm getting it setup for "developer mode"</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:07:43] **raw__&gt; used: 1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.14.11.5.1.1.2.1.1.1.7.1 free: 1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.14.11.5.1.1.2.1.1.1.6.1 total: 1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.14.11.5.1.1.2.1.1.1.5.1</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:07:49] **raw__&gt; k cool</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:14:25] **raw__&gt; the template that the pack installs is /Devices /Network /Switch /HP /Templates /HP ProCurve</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:14:46] **raw__&gt; I added the mem values to it since it doesn't have them by default</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:20:47] **cgibbons&gt; k sorry for the delay I had some dev env setup issues that I made hard on myself </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:20:55] **raw__&gt; np</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:22:07] **raw__&gt; Zenoss has quite the learning curve</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:22:30] **cgibbons&gt; yeah. we are working on making that a whole lot easier actually.</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:22:38] **raw__&gt; I'm going to be "The Zenoss Guy" so I need to learn as much as possible</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:22:53] **cgibbons&gt; right now we're in the midst of redoing the entire UI with a good UI designer, trying to make sure the things people need to do day-in day-out are super easy.</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:23:04] **raw__&gt; nice</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:23:13] **raw__&gt; is that going to be ready for next release?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:23:47] **cgibbons&gt; it'll be phased over several releases. the next release should have a new "quickstart" feature that's intended to make it easy for a brand new user to add devices after install, and then the next release after that gets a deeper treatment</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:24:02] **cgibbons&gt; we're sharing wireframes of what's being designed with the community... somewhere </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:24:04] **raw__&gt; ah, kind of a wizard of sorts I assume?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:24:29] **raw__&gt; see, I don't find adding devices to be all that difficult, all the basic stuff is pretty easy once you get used to it, it's just stuff like this that's really difficult</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:24:30] **cgibbons&gt; yeah, exactly, although we're making sure it'll be easy to use for advanced users, too.</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:24:56] **cgibbons&gt; from a biz perspective you can see why though... make it a real easy 'out of the box' experience for getting started.</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:25:10] **raw__&gt; I was expecting to just be able to use the data source as a value in a python expression, but now I find out that we need to write a collector script hehe</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:26:01] **raw__&gt; also, it'd be nice if the reporting functionality were a bit more powerful in the core version, but I guess that's part of how they make their money for enterprise</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:26:08] **raw__&gt; with that enterprise level reporting pack</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:26:20] **cgibbons&gt; i'm not even sure what's in that enterprise reporting pack, some goodies.</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:26:37] **raw__&gt; we're going to access the RRD files directly using a different tool</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:26:40] **cgibbons&gt; although I can tell you from other products I've written the whole enterprise reporting featureset turns into a quagmire</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:26:49] **raw__&gt; since it's the only real way that we can integrate the reporting in to a portal</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:27:07] **raw__&gt; Zenoss makes it too difficult to extract the reporting data straight from Zenoss</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:27:50] **raw__&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:28:02] **cgibbons&gt; via the export API?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:28:24] **raw__&gt; we've been looking at the API, and it's easier just to directly access the RRD files</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:28:41] **raw__&gt; we've been successfuly with integrating Zenoss with a ticketing system via the API though</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:28:49] **raw__&gt; and that's working fairly decently, still lots of work to do</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:29:03] **raw__&gt; successful*</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:32:07] **raw__&gt; the main things I'd personally like to see in Zenoss are more flexibility with graphing and thresholds, seems fairly limited right now. I'd love to see remote collector support that works properly in the core version (though I doubt that'll happen). Also, more powerful reporting features.</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:32:37] **raw__&gt; Oh, and it'd be nice to see it track individual process availability as a percentage value, like it does for each device</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:33:15] **cgibbons&gt; best thing to do there is to open an enhancement request via trac and our product manager will review it</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:33:22] **cgibbons&gt; they review new trac stuff like 3 times a week</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:33:43] **raw__&gt; yeh, I think we'll do that</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:34:09] **raw__&gt; so do you actually work for Zenoss Inc?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:34:14] **cgibbons&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:34:33] **cgibbons&gt; i'm on my development support rotation this week and next, so it's a good excuse to pick up some knowledge on areas i haven't touched yet</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:34:34] **raw__&gt; nice</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:34:45] **cgibbons&gt; i've mostly been working on our low-level windows integration</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:35:05] **raw__&gt; windows integration in what sense?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:35:30] **cgibbons&gt; we use the Samba 4 code to talk to Windows devices directly over MS-RPC for both WMI and PerfMon</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:35:37] **cgibbons&gt; instead of relying upon just SNMP</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:35:38] **raw__&gt; ah cool</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:35:52] **cgibbons&gt; that got a pretty major reworking for the 2.3 release</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:35:58] **raw__&gt; oh, by the way... the fact that Zenoss stores all passwords in Data.fs in plaintext is an absolute nightmare</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:36:06] **raw__&gt; you guys have to fix that, encrypt it using anything</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:36:08] **jmp242&gt; is that going to be in Core?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:36:25] **cgibbons&gt; jmp, the infrastructure part of it is in Core, but the perfmon stuff is an enterprise feature</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:36:32] **cgibbons&gt; but the stuff that does WMI monitoring in core uses it</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:36:33] **raw__&gt; we actually have to encrypt the entire hard drive of our boxes because of that</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:36:58] **cgibbons&gt; raw: please open a trac enhancement for that, seriously. we need more customers/users telling us that </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><span> right now not everyone thinks that is a problem, if you can believe it.</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:37:21] **raw__&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:37:27] **raw__&gt; that's a huge problem</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:37:28] **cgibbons&gt; the other places i've worked that would be a total nonstarter</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:37:49] **cgibbons&gt; but i can see why it was done that way... a lot of the smaller customers have 1-5 sysadmins that know all the passwords, so they don't consider that a breach</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:38:06] **raw__&gt; we had clients telling us that the passwords have to be encrypted and I was like "I'm sure they are" then I go digging around the Data.fs file and find the passwords displayed in plaintext</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:38:08] **jmp242&gt; Yea, where I work it's no big deal</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:38:09] **cgibbons&gt; wrong, of course, but understandable </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:38:15] **raw__&gt; worst of all, it was prefixed by "Password:"</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:38:28] **raw__&gt; so all I had to do was grep the file for "password" and voila</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:38:32] **raw__&gt; I almost fell off my chair lol</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:38:42] **jmp242&gt; although I would expect you ought to be able to use something pre-existing to save these things in a more secure way</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:39:47] **cgibbons&gt; at least with the new Windows code it doesn't send username &amp; password over the wire anymore </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:40:07] **raw__&gt; so where do I go to open a Trac?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:40:20] **cgibbons&gt; although the community Windows zenpack does some stuff with the CLI </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:40:26] **cgibbons&gt; shoudl be </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac</a></span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:40:32] **cgibbons&gt; let me validate with our community manager that is the right place for you to submit something</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:40:52] **raw__&gt; maybe if they had the trac link right on the main page more people would submit them</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:41:20] **cgibbons&gt; btw i have like 3/4 of this plugin written (it's going to be about 25 lines) but i keep chatting instead </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:41:25] **cgibbons&gt; and now i need a bite to eat, brb</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:41:34] **raw__&gt; I'm guessing only enterprise users get access to trac?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:41:48] **cgibbons&gt; nah there is an external &amp; internal trac that is separate</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:41:50] **raw__&gt; I don't see a signup link</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:42:12] **cgibbons&gt; sec lemme ask him</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:42:18] **raw__&gt; k thanks</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:42:28] **raw__&gt; I can submit like 5 or 6 right off the bat lol</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:42:34] **cgibbons&gt; great</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:43:12] **raw__&gt; also, is it normal for $ZENHOME to be /usr/local/zenoss/zenoss?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:43:25] **raw__&gt; most older documents that I have seen show it as /usr/local/zenoss</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:43:32] **raw__&gt; is this a new change made recently?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:47:46] **cgibbons&gt; it depends upon which installer you use</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:48:05] **raw__&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:48:11] **rhett&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:48:34] **jmp242&gt; at least for up to 2.2.4 rpm, $ZENHOME is /opt/zenoss</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:48:36] **raw__&gt; no idea which one we used, another guy here has been doing the installs</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:48:39] **raw__&gt; I just setup zenoss</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:48:55] **raw__&gt; Installing the Cisco Mibs was so painful lol</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:49:06] **raw__&gt; managed to finally get every single one loaded</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:49:27] **raw__&gt; I had to actually modify some Mibs to get them to load</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:53:13] **raw__&gt; hmm, if they had a zenoss training course taking place in Ottawa, Canada I'd definitely go to it, but it looks like they pretty much stick to the U.S for the courses</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:56:24] **raw__&gt; price is a bit steep for a 2 day training course though</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:57:23] **raw__&gt; I think we installed Zenoss via a .run file or something</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:57:47] **cgibbons&gt; that was probably one of the stack installers that we create with a partner called BitRock</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:57:56] **raw__&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:57:57] **cgibbons&gt; they relocate some things to make their installation system work right</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:58:05] **raw__&gt; I see</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:58:33] **cgibbons&gt; those guys are pretty amazing. they're in Spain and we'll send them email at like 6pm our time and they'll still be in the office.</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:58:50] **raw__&gt; crazy</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 12:59:09] **raw__&gt; I've heard of BitRock before</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 13:00:13] **cgibbons&gt; okay, so here's the deal. i've got a zenpack with a new collector plugin. i can export it and provide you a new egg that you can import, or a .zip file that we leave in developer mode so you can keep making changes to it as needed.</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 13:00:21] **raw__&gt; we're giving our first demo of zenoss to some of our execs today :|</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 13:00:31] **cgibbons&gt; the latter might be good if you're changing templates and what not, then you can add those to the zenpack &amp; export to save it off</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 13:00:35] **raw__&gt; I think I've tweaked just enough to make a decent showing</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 13:01:38] **raw__&gt; well, I can always just put it back in to dev mode if needed no?</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 13:02:12] **raw__&gt; hold on, I have to go to this zenoss demo for the execs</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 13:02:17] **cgibbons&gt; yeah there's a little bit of mojo you have to do, that's what I was stuck doing before</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 13:02:23] **raw__&gt; sorry, I'll be back in an undetermined amount of time</span><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 13:02:27] **cgibbons&gt; ok cool, better to do the demo before we muck with this anyway </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [06-Feb-2009 13:04:02] **jmp242&gt;

is the event class on that one /Events/Perf/Snmp, raw, or ?</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 15:56:11] **nemo2&gt; i bet they are syslogs</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 15:56:11] **cgibbons&gt; no it's a zenoss generated event in zenperfsnmp</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 15:56:27] **cgibbons&gt; the code is using event class Perf_Snmp but I'm curious if that actually is using /Events/Perf_Snmp or /Events/Perf/Snmp</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 15:57:52] **cgibbons&gt; in any event, it should be trivial to create a new event mapping that matches the text with regexp and drops the event</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 15:57:52] **cgibbons&gt; for someone that knows how to do that anyway :-)</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 15:57:52] **nemo2&gt; lol,true</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 15:57:52] **raw__&gt; well yeh</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 15:57:52] **raw__&gt;

so raw here's what you do, go the Events menu in the left-nav, then browse to Perf/Snmp</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:03:40] **cgibbons&gt; then add a new eventclass mapping down below, call it whatever, my_nasty_debug_event or whatever you feel like</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:06:26] **cgibbons&gt; then edit that, on the Regex input box put "Error reading value for .+", save, then on the zProperties tab you can change zEventAction to drop</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:06:57] **mrayzenoss&gt;

how to do it?</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:09:08] **mrayzenoss&gt; whenever you see an error like that in your stack-trace, delete the event</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:09:08] **mrayzenoss&gt;

evid is supposed to be unique</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:19:40] **cgibbons&gt; raw: not a statement of how much it should use for how many devices (I think we have that data but I dunno what it is), but our 'big' test box with a bunch of devices is using just under 2GB total for everything running on it.</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:20:17] **mrayzenoss&gt; sergeymasushko: you could probably come up with a sql query to find all the dupes, then delete those</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:20:43] **raw__&gt; ok, well, it just ate up over a gig of ram and swap while monitoring 8 devices</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:20:43] **raw__&gt; we restarted it and now it looks ok</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:20:49] **raw__&gt; are we going to have to cron a restart of it nightly or something?</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:21:30] **cgibbons&gt; i haven't really heard of that being a common problem, have you, matt?</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:22:04] **mrayzenoss&gt; not really, I run my home install of 10 devices on a slow linux box with 1.25 gigs of RAM</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:22:21] **sergeymasushko&gt; mrayzenoss: so is there a fix for that for now?</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:23:31] **mrayzenoss&gt; delete from status where evid='ASDFADSFASDFASDF'; </span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:23:31] **sergeymasushko&gt;

sergeymasushko: I'm not the best SQL guy, but you could do "select evid from status" and compare that to "select DISTINCT(evid) from status" and any time you have a dupe, delete it</span><br/><span> [12-Feb-2009 16:30:03] **sergeymasushko&gt;

1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1 is waht i meant</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:20:22] **int&gt; rhett_: this one works</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:20:39] **rhett_&gt; try it w/ v1 and v2c </span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:21:21] **rhett_&gt; it may be the version you are getting w/</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:23:17] **int&gt; rhett_: works with both (-v1 -v2c)</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:23:24] **rhett_&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:24:15] **rhett_&gt; go to /Devices /Server /Templates /FileSystem /usedBlocks and test against the device there</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:26:41] **int&gt; rhett_: works</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:27:40] **rhett_&gt; odd</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:27:53] **rhett_&gt; we can always do an rrdtool fetch from the datasource and just verify the data is there</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:31:00] **int&gt; rhett_: there is only usedBlocks rrds</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:32:18] **rhett_&gt; yeah.&#160; i thought you couldnt see used space on mounted filesystems no?</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:32:58] **int&gt; rhett_: ah, yeah, will check </span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:33:31] **rhett_&gt; rrdtool fetch pathtorrd AVERAGE -r 300 -s 1</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:33:44] **rhett_&gt; that will show the last hour at 5 minute resolution</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:33:45] **int&gt; rhett_: tried to remove localhost collector and created another one "$fqdn" and moved all devices to new one, but now there is localhost collector again... </span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:33:58] **rhett_&gt; or you can | tail -n 10 for the last 10 lines :\</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:34:17] **rhett_&gt; hm.&#160; unsure about that one.&#160; i only use the localhost collector</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:38:20] **int&gt; rhett_: no data in rrd, ie "nan"</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:39:20] **rhett_&gt; well we're getting closer</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:40:17] **rhett_&gt; what are the permissions in snmpd.conf on the box in question? is it walkable for the whole subnet or locked to a specific ip?</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:44:03] **int&gt; rhett_: it's open and works from zenoss host</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:44:21] **int&gt; rhett_: and zenoss sees total space somehow</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:44:44] **int&gt; rhett_: i tried to remove rrds and re-model them</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:45:23] **rhett_&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:45:27] **int&gt; now it thinks that free == total and used = 0 for all fs</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:49:54] **rhett_&gt; hm</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:50:41] **int&gt; rhett_: yay, it starts to work! at least it prints current values in info</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:50:50] **rhett_&gt; sweet</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:51:48] **int&gt; rhett_: any idea if i can change interval between checks for every item or for selected ones?</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:52:40] **rhett_&gt; well you could under the collector settings but that would require a change to the rra's to allow 1 minute resolution and that would require you to rebuild all of your data sources i.e. start from scratch</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:53:23] **rhett_&gt; i for one dont have enough horsepower to run 60 second datasources so i dont </span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:54:12] **int&gt; rhett_: thx for info!</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:54:29] **rhett_&gt; but yeah its possible. as i said the datasources need to be setup have 60 second rra and the poller needs to know to run every 60 seconds</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:54:34] **rhett_&gt; no problem</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 13:55:06] **int&gt;

i assume it means the zenwin poller cycle time ran too long</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 16:03:56] **gemineye&gt; It averages around 5.34, it hit over 60 for one poll</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 16:14:13] **nemo2&gt; means that maybe more than usual machines didnt respond</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 16:14:24] **nemo2&gt; and there fore the cycle was slower this time</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 16:14:35] **nemo2&gt; as long as it doesnt happen all the time its fine</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 20:08:39] **gemineye&gt; Does anyone know where I can change the threshold for the zenwin cycle time, or stop monitoring that all together?</span><br/><span> [18-Feb-2009 20:42:34] **simprix&gt;

I havent played around with zenoss that much </span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:06:22] **MajereDB8&gt; it's pretty easy for the most part</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:06:31] **tehhobbit&gt; but I read something about been able to acknowlage events with wget / curl from cli </span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:07:08] **tehhobbit&gt; you could build something with curl + procmail ( or the built in mail filtering in postfix ) to do that </span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:07:16] **MajereDB8&gt; there's a zenackevents program that you can use to acknowledge events</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:07:49] **MajereDB8&gt;

kisielk: still doesnt help you get past fw etc </span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:10:11] **MajereDB8&gt; well, the problem is that i'm primarily going to be using cell phones for acknowledgement</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:10:32] **kisielk&gt;

MajereDB8: then either make it work through email, or get a cell phone with VPN</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:10:59] **tehhobbit&gt; but mail to that address triggers a script instead of ending up in an inbox</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:11:16] **MajereDB8&gt; kisielk: that's what i'm trying to do. i've gotten the built in smtpd to send out an e-mail to my cell, using the evid as the subject line</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:11:47] **MajereDB8&gt; so then i reply to that, and zenpop3 parses it and creates an event, where the subject line containing the evid is the event summary</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:12:26] **MajereDB8&gt; so what i'm trying to do is come up with a way for zenoss to automatically parse that summary, strip out the re: , and then run zenackevents --evid={evt/summary}</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:12:46] **MajereDB8&gt; maybe i'm just not fundamentally understanding how event commands work</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:13:53] **tehhobbit&gt; MajereDB8: seems like its needless to involve zenoss it self</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:14:00] **tehhobbit&gt; just do it in the accual mailserver</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:15:51] **MajereDB8&gt; well, my customer doesn't have a fqdn, so i'm using a webmail with pop3. you're probably right, if there's a console-based e-mail client that has some ability to do some scripting, that would work better</span><br/><span> [23-Feb-2009 11:18:01] **tehhobbit&gt;

not that this is Windows' fault, but I'll probably have to reinstall for her</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 13:56:41] **mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, she uses Word extension stuff for work that makes it not an option</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 13:56:48] **mrayzenoss&gt; EndNote</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 13:57:04] **mrayzenoss&gt; and SAAS, a statistics package</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 13:57:24] **mrayzenoss&gt; I could go the WINE route possibly</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 13:57:36] **cain&gt; WINE is getting better</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 13:57:52] **cgibbons&gt; Windows is much better when you just give in and embrace it </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 13:58:06] **cain&gt; or open up a virtual</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 13:58:41] **mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, she's not gonna go for that.&#160; She's practically a luddite</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 13:59:09] **mrayzenoss&gt; I tried to explain virtualization and then she just asked "Why can't I just use Windows all the time?"</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 13:59:11] **cain&gt; cgibbons: I've had to embrace it for my laptop due to bad wireless driver support from broadcom</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:00:05] **cain&gt; heh, tell her because its safer</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:00:33] **mrayzenoss&gt; heh, I don't worry about safety too much, she's got the only Windows box on the network</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:00:35] **cain&gt; and easier to fix in case something happens to windows crashing</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:00:44] **mrayzenoss&gt; there is that</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:03:36] **cain&gt; so how long have you worked for zenoss, if i may ask</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:03:55] **mrayzenoss&gt; 1 year April 1</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:09:57] **cain&gt; how long does the upgrade process take</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:10:00] **cain&gt; guestimate</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:10:13] **mrayzenoss&gt; from which version to which?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:10:30] **cain&gt; 2.2.4 - 2.3.3</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:10:37] **mrayzenoss&gt; I did my source upgrade from 2.3.2 to 2.3.3 yesterday, took about 10 minutes but it's a really slow box</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:11:00] **mrayzenoss&gt; probably under an hour, depending on your configuration and ZenPacks</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:11:12] **mrayzenoss&gt; how many devices?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:11:23] **cain&gt; 170ish</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:11:43] **mrayzenoss&gt; 1 box?&#160; any distributed collectors?&#160; Are you using VMware?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:11:51] **mrayzenoss&gt; VMware ZenPack that is</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:13:03] **cain&gt; no, virtualhostmonitor</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:13:16] **cain&gt; 1 box no distributed collecters</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:13:43] **cain&gt; i'll need to get vmware zenpack afterward</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:13:46] **mrayzenoss&gt; are you using Virtual Hosts Monitor for VMware or Xen?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:15:26] **mrayzenoss&gt; so the Virtual Hosts Monitor for VMware is deprecated in favor of the new VMware ZenPack, so that may add a bit of time</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:15:27] **cain&gt; vmware i believe</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:15:43] **mrayzenoss&gt; but I'm sure Client Services can help you get everything lined up</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:15:56] **cain&gt; heh, already then</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:16:10] **mrayzenoss&gt; I don't actually run Enterprise myself, since I'm the Community Manager</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:17:01] **cain&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:17:03] **cain&gt; what do you run?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:17:12] **mrayzenoss&gt; Zenoss Core</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:17:29] **mrayzenoss&gt; I manage the Open Source side of the product</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:20:22] **cain&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:20:27] **cain&gt;

lol</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:50:00] **magnachef&gt; I'm upgrading from 2.1.3, to 2.2.4, so that I can upgrade to 2.3.3, but I can't seem to get events in the event console after upgrading to 2.2.4</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:50:20] **magnachef&gt; I am seeing events under the devices "Events" tab </span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:53:33] **teletype&gt; did you try doing a shift-reload or clearing your browser's cache?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:55:28] **magnachef&gt; yep, still no events</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:55:39] **teletype&gt; d'oh</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:55:40] **magnachef&gt; if I look at events under /Devices I see not events</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:55:52] **magnachef&gt; but if I go to /Devices/Linux, I will see the events </span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:56:16] **magnachef&gt; is there some setting that has changed that is only showing it in the immediate class of an alerting device?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:57:05] **magnachef&gt; with those events I can see, I go into the event details, add a log message, etc, so it seems like database connectivity is fine</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:57:07] **teletype&gt; donno</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:57:25] **teletype&gt; i had a similar problem and clearing my browser cache fixed it</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:57:38] **magnachef&gt; let me try a different browser</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:59:29] **magnachef&gt; weird...it showed up in my old browser, then I clicked on event console and they dissapeared</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 14:59:38] * magnachef is not insane, I promise</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 15:01:12] **magnachef&gt; hmmm...won't let me click the "Start" button either (it's not changing to "Stop"</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 15:05:30] **teletype&gt; heh, weird</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 15:06:01] **magnachef&gt; I wonder if I should just continue on with the upgrade to 2.3.3</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 15:06:17] **magnachef&gt; upgrading Zenoss scares the crap out of me</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 15:06:21] **teletype&gt;

yeah...can't seem to find it at the moment</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 16:43:03] **magnachef&gt; it's linked off a forum post I believe or on the zenoss blog</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 16:48:23] **gemineye&gt; I found the bugs fixed between 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 in the release notes, but not if there are any added features.</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 16:50:13] **cgibbons&gt; in theory (ahem), minor releases like that are just bug fixes</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 16:50:15] **magnachef&gt; ahh, it may have just been bug fixes</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 16:50:29] **cgibbons&gt; and iirc, in 2.3.3's case that was actually the case</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 16:51:31] **gemineye&gt; Ok, I was going to ask if this was a theoretical minor release, or a real minor release. I guess that answers my question.</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 16:52:02] **magnachef&gt; has anyone here ever had issues with the events not showing up in the event console?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 16:52:22] **magnachef&gt; ...yet showing under the device's Events tab</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 16:58:36] **gemineye&gt; Anyone had any problems with upgrading a stack installer?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 17:02:46] **magnachef&gt; I do the rpm upgrades</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 18:12:39] **ibscott&gt; could someone please explain the differences between a system and group? i'm having a hard time finding a good definition of each. </span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 19:14:11] **ibscott&gt; anyone online tonight?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 19:17:19] **gemineye&gt; I'm here</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 19:18:23] **ibscott&gt; i am trying to model a new tape drive we just purchased. modeling doesn't return much so far, but dell ships a mib for the device</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 19:18:49] **ibscott&gt; i've imported the mib into zenoss, but how do i model the device with it?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 19:22:34] **gemineye&gt; You really don't need mibs for zenoss. They just help in the respect that errors shouldn't be displayed as OID numbers. (I think). I use mibs to get descriptions of everything so I can figure out what OIDs I want to query.</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 19:33:26] **gemineye&gt; I was about to upgrade my zenoss to 2.3.3 but couldn't find instructions to restore the mysql data that I backup. Does anyone now how to do that?</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 19:40:38] **ibscott&gt; well, i know general mysql dumps</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 19:45:42] **ibscott&gt; however, if the schema has changed, the dump won't do you a lot of good</span><br/><span> [26-Feb-2009 19:46:03] **ibscott&gt;
