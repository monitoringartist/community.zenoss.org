&lt;rkagin&gt; moredakka: Ah, so it says how many failed pings, not how many successful pings.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:33:03]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; It's only incrementing the count of that device for every hour</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:33:49] &lt;moredakka&gt; Luckly we also have nagios running and it's pinging hasn't stopped like Zenoss's so we were covered for this one being down.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:33:51] &lt;rkagin&gt; moredakka: Does the failure count corelate to the last seen time, i.e. after 30 minutes from that last count, the last seen time is 30 minutes ago still?</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:34:49]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; they increment every 60 minutes.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:35:00]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; the device has been down for 21 hours now</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:35:02]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; ish</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:37:48] &lt;rkagin&gt; moredakka: I was just thinking about whether it gets seen only every 60 minutes or it fails one out of 60 times on the hour.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:38:53] &lt;moredakka&gt; If it failed one every hour then it would still come back after a minute (like the other devices do) then it would report as down in the next hour.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:40:13] &lt;rkagin&gt; moredakka: That's true - I guess I was under the impression that if it went up and then went down again, that the event would also simply increment, rather than clear itself and start over if that happened.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:40:34]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; moredakka: Sometimes the event doesn't clear, and thus you see what is happening</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:40:41]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; It is actually pinging the device</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:40:51]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; Just it fails once every hour</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:41:01]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; at least that is the best that I can determine from what you describe</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:41:25] &lt;moredakka&gt; This is even weirder. The same device that has only bee checking every hour I blocked the packets in the iptables to that device and zenping created another even that is incrementing properly but isn't clearing.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:42:04] &lt;moredakka&gt; The site is actually down right now so I don't know why it didn't created another event for this or increment these properly.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:44:24]&#160; *** fishstickz_ has joined #zenoss</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:45:35] &lt;moredakka&gt; Alright, this is getting to be fun. So I cleared my entry in the iptables to allow access to that device again and the event hasn't cleared. Just for fun I wanted to test it again so I blocked that IP again and it incremented the event like it was never a problem.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:45:42]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; Why is this doing this.....soooo weird.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:47:06]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; moredakka: For some reason some events stay active, and don't go away</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:47:28] &lt;creiht&gt; I haven't figured out exactly why this happens or of this is the desired way it should work or not</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:47:37] &lt;moredakka&gt; that's what it seems...but it only seems to be that way for these two devices....I've tested with a couple others right now and it seems to clear those events.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:47:52]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; hmm</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:47:58]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; I wish I knew as well</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:48:03]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; you and me both.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:49:03]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; probably me more though</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:51:01]&#160; *** fishstickz has quit IRC</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:54:24] &lt;rkagin&gt; Alright, I think I've read most everything about ZenPacks, but I still am not 100% sure about everything they have to offer.</span><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 11:59:50]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; rkagin: Welcome to the club </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span>[20-Jun-2007 12:05:14] &lt;rkagin&gt; creiht: 21 views and 0 replies to the post, so hopefully someone figures it out.

&lt;creiht&gt; If you can, check the snmp config to make sure it allows your zenoss ip to access snmp</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:46:01]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; my guess is it limits it to a select number of ips</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:46:08]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; most places do this for security reasons</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:46:46]&#160; &lt;tty01&gt; ah ok i see it now</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:46:54]&#160; &lt;tty01&gt; it was sending traps to only the older zenoss box</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:47:25]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; ok</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:47:34]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; and for traps you will need the mibs loaded</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:47:39]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; to correctly identify thme</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:48:02]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; there are two pieces of snmp though</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:48:06]&#160; &lt;tty01&gt; yeah i thought the mib had to be loaded, even for a walk</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:48:12]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; nah</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:48:25]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; the mibs are only used when zenoss receives a trap</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:48:44]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; At least as far as I understand</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 10:49:00]&#160;

Does zenwin have to be installed on all the windows devices that are being monitored or does it get installed on another "zenoss server" that has an instance of windows then the main zenoss box polls from that one windows box?</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:23:05]&#160; *** bzed has joined #zenoss</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:27:11]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; omg I %100 wish there was a dev around...</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:29:53]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; moredakka: zenoss now uses SAMBA to poll windows.&#160; You don't need to install daemons on the windows servers any longer.</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:35:16]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; moredakka: As far as I know is that it talks directly through WMI, so you just have ZenWin installed on a zenoss box which polls WMI on the windows servers.&#160; I believe that it does require a user on the box with certain rights to be able to read the WMI</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:37:57]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; creiht: definitely...&#160; You provide the administrator (local to server) account to zenoss and it polls the server through WMI....&#160; It has worked flawlessly so far.</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:41:24]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; Ok but currently I'm using 1.1.1, the zenwin deamon would ahve to be installed on those servers to get all the OIDs to respond properly?</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:41:54]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; The problem right now is, we don't have access to install extra agents and the company that we do monitoring for will not allow it.</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:41:56]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; moredakka: </span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:41:57]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; err</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:41:59]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; hehe</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:42:00]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; no</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:42:29]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; on the old version you have to have ZenWin running on one windows machine that would then poll the other servers</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:43:03]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; Zenoss isn't reporting cpu usage and a couple other things on the windows boxes unless there is an agent or something like that installed on the windows machine</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:43:04]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; moredakka: I'd highly recommend upgrading...&#160; there are step-by-step instructions on www.zenoss.com</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:43:12]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; I'm not sure if the rest of the Zenoss has to be running on the windows box</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:43:25]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; moredakka: the snmp extender does have to be installed...&#160; Its not an agent though.</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:44:01]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; I just can't remember the name...starts with an 'i'... :-/</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:44:22]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; snmp-informant</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:44:26]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; Ahhhhhhhh</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:44:27]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; yes</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:44:48]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; without that installed zenoss wasn't reporting properly all the cpu usage and memory pages...etc....</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:45:08]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; but if I either upgraded to 2.0 or used zenwin that will fix the issue?</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:45:25]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; moredakka: yeah...&#160; had that same problem...&#160; snmp-informant still needs to be installed with 2.0.0</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:45:35]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; boooo</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:45:40]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; moredakka: but you don't need to install zenwin on individual boxes...</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:45:49]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; why doesn't zenoss read those oids properly?</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:46:10]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; Solarwind's product reads those oids right outta the box and nothing needs to get installed on the devices</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:46:36]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; moredakka: *SHRUG*....&#160; post something on the forum, maybe someone will answer</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:47:02]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; moredakka: Windows doesn't expose the OIDS on its own</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:47:09]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; That's why you have to install SNMP Informant</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:47:21]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; just to get off topic a little bit, with the monitors, the default one being localhost.&#160; How does zenoss know where that information is coming from?</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:47:21]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; To expose the CPU and memory info</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:47:48]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; It just doesn't make sense that one product reads the not exposed oids properly and another doesn't unless you install the snmp-informant</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:48:13]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; moredakka: It is probably getting it through another method</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:48:24]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; weird.</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:48:32]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; Bulwinkle: I thought ZenWin allowed you to get CPU and Mem info?</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:48:38]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; well, I'll put that one on the back burner for a bit.</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:49:11]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; moredakka: Well see that is what I was thinking, was that they were using the WMI, and that's why I thought that ZenWin would give you what you want</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:49:14]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; creiht: I think it does...&#160; it will still flag SNMP errors if snmp informant is installed</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:49:16]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; without having to install stuff</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:49:25]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; creiht: (isn't installed)</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:49:32]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; Bulwinkle: And that is fine</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:49:38]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; You can modify the template</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:49:54]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; to not try to pull the info through snmp</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:50:03]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; But it should still be able to get it through WMI</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:50:38]&#160; &lt;moredakka&gt; So when zenoss uses zenwin it sends a request to the zenwin box which connects to the device?</span><br/><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:50:41]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; creiht: nid</span><br/><span><span>[22-Jun-2007 11:50:57]&#160;

&lt;Bulwinkle&gt; MoreDakka_: yep</span><br/><span>[29-Jun-2007 13:19:16]&#160; &lt;MoreDakka_&gt; Do all your devices send all the proper traps (like shutdowns, reboots, packet loss...etc...etc)?&#160; And does Zenoss read them properly?</span><br/><span>[29-Jun-2007 13:19:44]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; MoreDakka_: all of my network devices do</span><br/><span>[29-Jun-2007 13:21:14]&#160; &lt;MoreDakka_&gt; Bah.....I'm trying to get a CentOS 4.4 box to send traps to Zenoss and all I'm getting is snmp traps, nothing else.&#160; We've also got other devices sending traps to zenoss and it seems that zenoss isn't getting them or not processing them (have those same devices sending traps to solarwinds monitoring and it seels all the traps)....so I'm confused on why zenoss isn't reading all the traps.</span><br/><span>[29-Jun-2007 13:22:20]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; MoreDakka_: do you mean it is not receiving them or not formatting them properly</span><br/><span>[29-Jun-2007 13:22:40]&#160; &lt;MoreDakka_&gt; Well i'm unsure if zenoss is even getting them as there are no log files that show that information.</span><br/><span>[29-Jun-2007 13:25:09]&#160; &lt;Bulwinkle&gt; MoreDakka_: that would definitely be a starting point</span><br/><span>[29-Jun-2007 13:25:43]&#160; &lt;MoreDakka_&gt; Well I know that zenoss is getting some of the traps but it seems that other traps that are being sent out aren't getting to zenoss or not being processed by zenoss</span><br/><span>[29-Jun-2007 13:26:07]&#160;

&lt;MoreDakka_&gt; yes</span><br/><span>[29-Jun-2007 13:51:59]&#160; &lt;bmunger&gt; by default or with another addon?&#160; i dont have it installed yet</span><br/><span>[29-Jun-2007 13:52:23]&#160;
