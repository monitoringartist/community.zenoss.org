I'm looking at our demo server and it has /USA/Austin /USA/Annapolis /USA/Chicago and from /Locations it shows all the events below</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:38:44] **mrayzenoss&gt; for the USA button</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:38:53] **mrayzenoss&gt; and then when I click on USA it shows the 3 sites</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:39:06] **rhett__&gt; hm</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:39:29] **mrayzenoss&gt; USA has the address "United States"</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:39:52] **mrayzenoss&gt; and each city is of the form "Chicago, Illinois, USA"</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:40:39] **mrayzenoss&gt; and USA reports 10 subdevices and 3 subaddresses</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:43:14] **rhett__&gt; k</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:44:32] **rhett__&gt; oh well i can make this work.&#160; i will just have to reorganize once its fixed</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:44:38] **rhett__&gt; but thanks for the help!</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:44:41] **mrayzenoss&gt; np</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:45:15] **rhett__&gt; it dosnt help most of the stuff i am looking at is within a 15 mile radius so any arbitrary points mucks up the map</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:45:37] **mrayzenoss&gt; rhett__: perhaps the zip code?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:45:47] **rhett__&gt; hm</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:45:53] **mrayzenoss&gt; or GPS coordinate?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:45:57] **rhett__&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:46:05] **rhett__&gt; i shall try</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:46:15] **mrayzenoss&gt; good luck, I gotta run</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:46:23] **rhett__&gt; k</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:46:25] **rhett__&gt; thanks again</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 13:46:28] **rhett__&gt; until next time</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 14:00:14] **gf69&gt; i put in usa then moved new york/elmira under it and got an error</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 14:01:44] **jmp242&gt; hey, can you autoclear info messages with a mapping in the same class say /App/Log that is a clear event?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 14:09:29] **jmp242&gt; anyone who's good with event mappings, and what might make changing an event mapping zProperty from history to status, or severity from info to clear would make it just disappear entirely? I.E. not showing up anywhere.... Or else I can't find it in history or Status views . ..</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 14:09:39] **gf69&gt; for base if i put in locations/ it shows nothing</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:20:39] **gf69&gt; got the colubris units mapped in zenoss as well</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:21:28] **gf69&gt; now the boss gave me a list of like 50 to add lol</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:30:10] **gf69&gt; if a device being monitored is on a dynamic ip, can zenoss detect that and set the new ip accordingly?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:43:11] **flepper&gt; hi there</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:43:14] **killing-joke&gt; have the developers left for the day?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:43:25] **killing-joke&gt; hi flepper</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:43:29] **flepper&gt; I have a question</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:43:34] **killing-joke&gt; shoot</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:43:49] **flepper&gt; I am monitoring a number of servers and have defined processes that need to be watched</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:44:10] **flepper&gt; monitoring the server works, all of host mib works, performance graphs are drawn etc.</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:44:30] **flepper&gt; but when I intentionally kill one of the processes that are being watched, this is not noticed by zenoss</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:44:43] **flepper&gt; it seems that the frequency of the checks is (way) too low</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:45:04] **flepper&gt; how is this intended to work?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:45:27] **killing-joke&gt; not noticed immediately?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:45:32] **killing-joke&gt; or not noticed after hours?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:45:33] **flepper&gt; right</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:45:46] **flepper&gt; haven't waited more than hours</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:45:57] **flepper&gt; what I need is near instantaneous notification</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:46:04] **killing-joke&gt; did you write the monitoring script?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:46:12] **flepper&gt; er no.</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:46:19] **killing-joke&gt; no problem</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:46:36] **flepper&gt; I defined a regular expression to watch over snmp process table</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:47:09] **killing-joke&gt; so you could harvest the table at 3:00PM, and at 3:00:01 the process could die.</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:47:18] **flepper&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:47:29] **flepper&gt; and to be honest I have no clue when it harvests</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:47:36] **flepper&gt; that mechanism is unclear to me</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:47:40] **killing-joke&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:49:15] **killing-joke&gt; i'm looking at my setup</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:49:25] **flepper&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:51:46] **killing-joke&gt; click on the IP or FQDN or the device</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:52:26] **flepper&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:52:29] **killing-joke&gt; down arrow, STATUS, hardware, software, etc in a bar across the top</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:52:42] **killing-joke&gt; click down arrow, choose zProperties(s)</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:53:03] **killing-joke&gt; whatever the h*|| those are</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:53:36] **killing-joke&gt; see "zCommandCycleTime"?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:53:44] **flepper&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:53:55] **flepper&gt; it says 60</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:54:04] **flepper&gt; that looks like once a minute?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:55:04] **killing-joke&gt; try waiting more than sixty seconds, plus the connect time for the sockets, plus the python object time, plus the web server time</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:55:10] **killing-joke&gt; maybe ... 75 seconds?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:55:39] **killing-joke&gt; if you have DNS that times out on certain lookups, that can really screw up this process</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:55:50] **flepper&gt; I'd say that all zproperties that start with zCommand have to do with collection over the 'command' interface</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:55:56] **flepper&gt; meaning colletion over ssh.</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:56:01] **flepper&gt; which is not what I do</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:56:20] **killing-joke&gt; ah. my misunderstanding.</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 16:56:48] **flepper&gt; but I was on that same trail... there must be an interval to set somewhere</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 17:01:42] **killing-joke&gt; is it possible that you are polling regularly and not checking the elements of the MIB that will generate an alert?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 17:02:21] **killing-joke&gt; that is, getting the process table, but not the right lines out if it?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 17:04:37] **flepper&gt; I am not sure</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 17:04:55] **flepper&gt; I am doing some more testing now</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 17:08:22] **killing-joke&gt; you can watch either of the interfaces with tcpdump, ethereal, wireshark, or some other sniffer on tcp/161 to see if the requests are coming at regular intervals</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 17:09:21] **killing-joke&gt; any of them will expand the packet payload and decode it for you, so you can watch for changes (state transitions, processes coming/going, whatever)</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 17:10:11] **flepper&gt; yeah that's a good idea to get some more insight</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 17:11:47] **killing-joke&gt; mrayzenoss: did the devs leave?</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 17:12:10] **mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, the session was a little earlier</span><br/><span> [04-Dec-2008 17:12:12] **mrayzenoss&gt;

I've done a bit of reading in the Zenoss documentation and site. One of the biggest concerns we have (like most others) is alert consolidation or collapsing alerts based on tiers. From what I gather, Zenoss does provide the ability to handle this.</span><br/><span> [08-Dec-2008 05:42:49] **jcookeman&gt; However, we have many sites, and I was wondering how clever this logic is.

the traps are being received by the machine, but i dont think they are doing anything</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:03:03] **purevol&gt; or anything is being done with them rather</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:03:19] **purevol&gt; the mibs are all installed</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:03:31] **purevol&gt; as per the process</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:04:28] **magnachef&gt; you should see traps even if the mibs aren't loaded</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:04:34] **magnachef&gt; they'll just be unknown</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:04:40] **purevol&gt; i figured as much</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:04:52] **magnachef&gt; maybe community string?</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:04:55] **purevol&gt; maybe i should remove the mibs</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:05:02] **magnachef&gt; probably not the issue</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:05:03] **purevol&gt; community string is default</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:05:27] **purevol&gt; maybe i should look in mysql</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:05:39] **purevol&gt; i have the packets captured coming in to port 162</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:05:49] **purevol&gt; but thats all i get</span><br/><span> [11-Dec-2008 14:05:54] **nemo2&gt;

Please post it to the forum once you have the answer.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:38:28] **__ian__&gt; realmelancon: what version?</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:38:38] **realmelancon&gt; from 2.2.4 to 2.3.2</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:38:59] **__ian__&gt; using DistributedCollector?</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:39:11] **realmelancon&gt; ian: yes.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:39:53] **__ian__&gt; You upgrade the main zenoss server. You then use the Update Hub and Update Collector menu items to update each hub/collector other than the original localhost/localhost ones.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:39:59] **__ian__&gt; Hey, look, __jason__'s here</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:40:18] **realmelancon&gt; ian: well not sure if its called Distributed Collectors (this is core version)</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:40:37] **realmelancon&gt; ian: its a remote collector.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:40:37] **mrayzenoss&gt; ahhh, you did it by hand?</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:41:53] **mrayzenoss&gt; It looks like the release notes for 2.3.2 suggest doing the main server first, then the hubs and collectors</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:42:25] **mrayzenoss&gt; I would assume this applies to a manually deployed remote collector</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:42:34] **realmelancon&gt; mrayzenoss: Yes. by hand.&#160; OK. That makes sense.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:43:16] **mrayzenoss&gt; realmelancon: Did you follow the remote SNMP instructions? I'm always curious how well those work</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:44:20] **__jason__&gt; Do you have a zenhub on the remote server or are those collectors talking to the hub back on the main zenoss server?</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:44:28] __jason__ is now known as zenossjason</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:44:43] **realmelancon&gt; mrayzenoss: yes. and it works perfectly for me</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:44:48] zenossjason is now known as jasonzenoss</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:45:08] **realmelancon&gt; jason: the collectors all talk directly to the main server.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:46:12] **realmelancon&gt; two things are bugging me at the moment. sometimes i cannot see performance graphs for collectors.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:46:16] **jasonzenoss&gt; It's a bit tougher in that situation. Updates to the hub on the main servers could in theory break communications with the remote daemons until you've updated them too. So the general answer is that you need to update both at the same time.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:46:32] **realmelancon&gt; then i log on the collectors and restart zenrender</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:46:46] **jmp242&gt; I'm wondering - is it by design that event transforms do not inherit down the class heirarchy (or really anything doesn't seem to inherit down necessarily)</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:46:47] **jasonzenoss&gt; I don't know specifically with the versions you are upgrading from/to if that's the case or not though.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:47:57] **realmelancon&gt; jasonzenoss: thanks. i will backup everything first, update central server, then the collectors.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:48:34] **jasonzenoss&gt; jmp242: zProps are the only thing that really inherit down the device class hierarchies I think</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:49:59] **realmelancon&gt; thanks to everyone. got 2 go.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:51:34] **jasonzenoss&gt; Didn't earlier versions of zenoss allow event transformations to be defined on any event class? Maybe I'm thinking of something else, but I think that changed around 2.2 or so.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:55:32] **jmp242&gt; I thought so</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:55:45] **jmp242&gt; I recalled that suddenly I was having issues getting transforms to apply</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:55:55] **jmp242&gt; I think it either needs to be more obvious in the cocumentation</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:56:00] **jasonzenoss&gt; I don't know offhand why that change was made.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:56:03] **jmp242&gt; or we need to get that working again for a class</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:56:18] **jmp242&gt; it just feels in the UI like you put the transform in the class</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:56:24] **jmp242&gt; and it applies to the mappings and events in the class</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:56:45] **jmp242&gt; If not, I'm not really sure why there is a transforms UI for a class - when would it EVER get applied to an event mapped there?</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 10:57:28] **jmp242&gt; Though it didn't seem to stop working with my /perf/filesystem transform(s)</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 11:07:54] **jasonzenoss&gt; jmp242: Unfortunately they couple people who can probably best discuss mappings aren't around today. You might want to raise the subject again here after the holidays when we can drag them into the discussion.</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 11:09:15] **jmp242&gt; great, I'm ready for a holiday break anyway</span><br/><span> [18-Dec-2008 11:12:06] **mrayzenoss&gt;

or whatever</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:34:03] **bzed&gt; sounds like a good idea</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:34:06] **bitmonk&gt; just trying to find if anyone else is on a similar path</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:34:09] **bitmonk&gt; yah noone seems to disagree</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:34:25] **bzed&gt; although I'm not sure if it works</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:34:33] **bitmonk&gt; well i don't doubt</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:34:35] **bitmonk&gt; i want to help</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:34:41] **bitmonk&gt; i just probably need to get active on ML and stuff</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:35:00] **bzed&gt; as *if I remember right, not sure* zenoss ships with some of the CMF stuff, and you need more recent versions for plone.. which will break zenoss</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:35:03] **bitmonk&gt; basically a lot of work i do will need modification of core code in minor ways, but like, across ZenPacks or something.. to modernize python / zope style</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:35:10] **bitmonk&gt; yes yes i know about all those details</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:35:13] **bitmonk&gt; i'm talking future</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:35:22] **bitmonk&gt; plone community knows CMF better than zenoss</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:35:29] **bitmonk&gt; talking about helping zenoss grow into 2006</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:35:44] **bitmonk&gt; but like trying to avoid a fork yanno, not only doesnt help anyone, but a big pain</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:35:52] **bitmonk&gt; lots of security and perf fixes in the past 5 years</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:35:56] **bzed&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:35:59] **bitmonk&gt; or whatever</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:36:01] **bitmonk&gt; 2.8 is old</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:36:06] **bitmonk&gt; my years are all off pretty late ;d</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:36:10] **bzed&gt; I'm not sure why the zenoss devs are still stuck with such old code</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:36:12] **bitmonk&gt; but the point clear i think</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:36:16] **bitmonk&gt; well it's a big pain</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:36:30] **bitmonk&gt; but my experience in working with the plone chain of progress can help me to help zenoss walk a similar path</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:36:32] **bitmonk&gt; perhaps more quickly</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:36:57] **bzed&gt; they told me more than a year ago thay they'd want to upgrade to a recent version of zope, or something similar</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:36:59] **bitmonk&gt; zenoss is like just shy of plone2.0-land zope code, and in 2.5 there was a lot of advancement, and a lot of mistakes..</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:37:07] **bitmonk&gt; yah i need to get on list and see who wants to help</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:37:24] **bitmonk&gt; basically anyone willing to accept patches for this purpose would be good, i can write code that'll work in multiple zope ver</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:37:35] **bitmonk&gt; it's not fun but it's not rocket surgery</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:37:57] **bzed&gt; probably contacting their community manager helps</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:38:16] **bzed&gt; they usually accept patches and suggestions via the bug tracker</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:38:27] **bzed&gt; if I remember right it has an anonymous login, too</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:39:02] **bzed&gt; I have an account for it since I dropped a lot of bug reports</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:39:08] **bitmonk&gt; well i need more than just patch acceptance</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:39:14] **bitmonk&gt; they make a lot of progress while i try to patch things</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:39:18] **bitmonk&gt; i need people interested in cooperating</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:39:28] **bitmonk&gt; i can do the work just need them to work with me on merging zope compat with new dev</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:39:37] **bitmonk&gt; i'm like totally fogged on what happens between vers</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:39:44] **bitmonk&gt; trunk is an enigma wrapped in deli paper</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:40:29] **bzed&gt;

that's what i'll do</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:40:46] **bitmonk&gt; see if anyone cares</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:40:50] **bitmonk&gt; then we can private mail</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:40:55] **bitmonk&gt;

basically i got a build to run by disabling one bit of the makefile and installing that deb</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:41:31] **bzed&gt; I'd love to finish the debian packages</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:41:35] **bitmonk&gt; but i really installed almost all of it as debs</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:41:49] **bitmonk&gt; buildout is a zope-style / setuptools-based tool for building a zope environment..</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:41:52] **bzed&gt; I put a lot of work into it.. and I'm a bit pissed that it's still not completed</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:42:09] **bitmonk&gt; but i'm not even sure that the pollers and whatnot need buildout, they might want to be eggs, so then you can install them on a node that has nothing else..</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:42:33] **bitmonk&gt; well keep in touch, maybe i can help, what i am producing would be a better developer environment at very least, then comes deployment..</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:42:38] **bitmonk&gt; plone debs are probably based on buildout</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:42:42] **bzed&gt; no</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:42:47] **bitmonk&gt; contact me using email form at bitmonk.net or vongogo.net</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:42:53] **bzed&gt; debian uses dzhandle to do the stugg</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:42:57] **bzed&gt; stuff</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:43:02] **bitmonk&gt; yah i could surely learn from you</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:43:03] **bitmonk&gt; no doubt</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:43:07] **bitmonk&gt; would love to help</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:43:08] **bzed&gt; which was written by some ubuntu and debian developers</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:43:10] **bitmonk&gt; did you get my pm with email?</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:43:22] **bzed&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:43:47] **bitmonk&gt; please email me, i'd love to keep in touch</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:43:57] **bitmonk&gt; i think our paths are intended to cross</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:44:18] **bitmonk&gt; i am interested in debuntu deployment, but also in zope-style-ness, would like to help you learn about the other side and perhaps come to improve general style..</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:44:25] * bitmonk probably knows whoever wrote dzhandle</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:44:35] **bitmonk&gt; i can probably drink that sucker under the table</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:44:39] **bzed&gt; bitmonk: doko started with it</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:44:45] **bitmonk&gt; oh i dont know doko</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:44:49] **bitmonk&gt; but i probably know someone</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:44:57] **bitmonk&gt; and drunk them under the table at a plone conf! :-P</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:00] **bzed&gt; haha</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:04] **bzed&gt; kobold?</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:07] **bitmonk&gt; wiggy?</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:17] **bzed&gt; hmm... not sure if wiggy had his fingers in it</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:18] **bitmonk&gt; (wichert?)</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:22] **bitmonk&gt; yah i dunno</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:25] **bzed&gt; I think he stopped doing debian stuff before</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:28] **bitmonk&gt; i'm sure he had words with the folks tho</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:35] **bitmonk&gt; he's spent years talking up debian plone pkgs to me</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:42] **bzed&gt; haha</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:44] * bitmonk and wiggy aren't brethren</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:46] **bitmonk&gt; :-P</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:45:52] **bitmonk&gt; though i think we respect one another at a distance</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:46:04] **bitmonk&gt; like limi</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:46:12] * bitmonk shudder at thought of googlimi</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:46:41] **bzed&gt; dzhandle is nice as it does all the ugly stuff for you.. like setting up a zope or zeo instance.... and install products into them</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:47:01] **bitmonk&gt; well</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:47:04] **bzed&gt; but it could be improved for sure</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:47:05] **bitmonk&gt; buildout does that stuff better</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:47:14] **bitmonk&gt; based on virtualenv</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:47:19] **bitmonk&gt; maybe dzhandle handy</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:47:20] **bitmonk&gt; i dunno</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:47:26] **bitmonk&gt; not a big fan of letting OS touch my zope</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:47:35] * bitmonk set up acm.org and siggraph.org on zope</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:47:49] **bitmonk&gt; RHEL5 knows how to give me a /usr/bin/python2.4 and shut the hell up ;d</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:47:55] **bitmonk&gt; er RHEL4 as it were with ACM</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:47:56] **bzed&gt; the problem is that if you distrubute plone or something similar with a distribution</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:48:09] **bzed&gt; people expect to apt-get install plone and have a working system afterwards</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:48:15] **bitmonk&gt; oh i agree</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:48:18] **bitmonk&gt; i dont decry these solutions</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:48:20] **bitmonk&gt; i just won't use them</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:48:27] **bitmonk&gt; i think that expert solutions need to live aside</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:48:30] **bzed&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:48:31] **bzed&gt; definitely</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:48:32] **bitmonk&gt; it's more dangerous than using a distro apache pkg</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:48:46] **bitmonk&gt; i mean i have charged $35k to install a plone cluster</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:49:04] **bitmonk&gt; that includes a relative guarantee that as long as they don't break python, os upgrades won't break it, or espescially delete their database.</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:49:28] **bitmonk&gt; but that's not to say i shouldn't get involved in dzhandle dev (esp if wiggy isn't!) and become responsible for as well as comfortable with its' behaviour.</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:50:13] **bitmonk&gt; (also a lot of that charge was for this jerkass IT mgr constantly screaming "i dont care what it costs! just do it!" and changing his mind every 6.5 hours)</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:50:26] **bitmonk&gt; (but i earned every dollar and used the money to move from TX to CA even if povertously ;d)</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:50:32] **bzed&gt; </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:51:50] **bzed&gt; dzhandle is not really maintained at the moment I think</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:52:52] **bitmonk&gt; hm</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:53:40] **bzed&gt; last year kobold and me spent a lot of time on it more than a year ago</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:53:56] **bzed&gt; s/last year//</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 02:56:20] **bzed&gt; we fixed a lot of bugs and added zeo handling stuff</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:03:34] * bitmonk would like to help z3-ify</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:03:51] **bitmonk&gt; honestly zenoss can gain a lot by skipping zope 2.9 and going all the way to 2.11</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:03:55] **bitmonk&gt; no reason to use an intermediary version</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:04:05] **bzed&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:04:11] **bzed&gt; and it shouldn't make a big difference</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:04:18] **bitmonk&gt; newer zope learned a lot from plone</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:04:19] **bzed&gt; as they have to rewrite a lot of stuff for it anyeway</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:04:22] **bitmonk&gt; and i learned a lot from plone abou tmoving</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:04:23] **bitmonk&gt; yah</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:04:32] **bitmonk&gt; i'd love to share what i know and help zenoss rawk</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:04:51] **bitmonk&gt; i think it can become the foundation for kicking the butt of something like Sun xVM Ops Manager</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:05:03] **bitmonk&gt; esp given my experience @ Rackspace</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:05:11] **bzed&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:05:39] **bzed&gt; would be good for zenoss</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:05:43] **bzed&gt; I really like it</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:05:51] **bitmonk&gt; yah zenoss is a nice platform</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:05:55] **bzed&gt; but at the current state... I wouldn't use it I have to admit</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:06:04] **bzed&gt; I don;t want to be stuck with zope2.8</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:06:18] **bitmonk&gt; well zope 2.8 not so bad but yah upgrading would be a huge painless advantage</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:06:21] **bitmonk&gt; performance, reliability, etc..</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:06:25] **bitmonk&gt; still all python 2.4</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:06:29] **bitmonk&gt; so only the Zope apis should be a concern</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:06:54] **bzed&gt; another thing... most distros ship 2.5 as default now</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:07:17] **bitmonk&gt; just seems to me so much info is input for systems to monitor in zenoss, i could just generate systems config, provision VMs and physical systems, VM servers, storage, network assets, etc..</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:07:22] **bitmonk&gt; yah but all have 2.4 avail</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:07:25] **bitmonk&gt; all zope uses 2.4</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:07:30] **bitmonk&gt; so, that's zope-life</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:07:36] **bitmonk&gt; 2.11 may actually work with 2.5</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:07:44] **bitmonk&gt; but python 2.4 should work, i think</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:07:46] **bitmonk&gt; maybe not</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:07:48] **bitmonk&gt; 2.10 for sure</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:08:05] **bzed&gt; hmm if I remember right even zope2.10 works with python2.5 now</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:08:08] **bitmonk&gt; i think at least it makes sense for zenoss to step forward into whatever the latest it can use for python 2.4</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:08:12] **bitmonk&gt; maybe so</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:08:16] **bzed&gt; or debian and ubuntu patched it to do so</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:08:25] **bitmonk&gt; yah not sure if i'd go that route</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:08:26] **bzed&gt; I have to admit I didn;t look into ti for some time</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:08:56] **bzed&gt; or it was just patched not to use /usr/bin/python but ..python2.4 instead</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:08:59] **bitmonk&gt; that's why i prefer using ubuntu python2.4 and python-libxml2 python-imaging python-virtualenv etc.. and then just virtualenv into a buildout and let setuptools and zope community take me from there..</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:09:00] **bzed&gt; no clue </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:09:05] **bitmonk&gt; yah that's what i do</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:09:13] **bitmonk&gt; i patch easy_install and virtualenv to use /usr/bin/python2.4</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:09:23] **bzed&gt; I hate setuptools from a package view...</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:09:34] **bitmonk&gt; well not everything can be an os pkg</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:09:34] **bzed&gt; it's *SO* broken</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:09:41] **bitmonk&gt; allows us to do dep resolution within a python app</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:09:46] **bitmonk&gt; which we can do in any dir of the os</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:09:49] **bitmonk&gt; compartmentalized</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:09:51] **bitmonk&gt; pretty handy</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:09:54] **bzed&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:10:02] **bzed&gt; but not useable for packages</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:10:07] **bitmonk&gt; zenoss takes that to an extreme by installing its' own python and mysql and every library ;d</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:10:23] **bzed&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:10:24] **bitmonk&gt; potentially, actually, such a tool should handle both cases..</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:10:29] **bzed&gt; and even worse, they patch things...</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:10:34] **bitmonk&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:10:36] **bzed&gt; and never bring the patches to upstream</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:10:40] **bitmonk&gt; well i'm working on at least turning that into a buildout</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:10:46] **bitmonk&gt; which zope-land and python-land people can read</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:11:00] **bitmonk&gt; want to talk people into turning ZenPacks into standard eggs, seems to be the trend anyway</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:11:00] **bzed&gt; and some of the patches were weird, but if I remember right they were for windows only</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:11:09] **bitmonk&gt; i think if i join the list and listen in people will be doing some of what i'd like to see</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:11:22] **bitmonk&gt; yah well that happens in all python enterprise world :/</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:11:33] **bitmonk&gt; fscking windoze</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 03:11:36] **bzed&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 09:23:19] **Cosmin&gt; anyone know why Zenoss is not showing all the routes for an device?</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 11:23:42] **locohost&gt; it should show all the routs</span><br/><span> [29-Dec-2008 11:24:01] **locohost&gt;

hey guys - I was at 2.2.4 - and upgraded a few weeks ago to 2.3.0 and then even more recently to 2.3.2 - upgrades seemed to go ok- data accessible afterwords - everything seemed to be going great - except I stopped getting email notifications. - test messages work.
