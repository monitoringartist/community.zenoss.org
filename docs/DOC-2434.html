its just an ubuntu box sitting in my room</span><br/><span>[03-May-2007 15:59:47] &lt;jimmy-james&gt; not an ideal server, but i just wanted to play with zenoss to see how it compares to nagios</span><br/><span>[03-May-2007 16:02:35] &lt;progma&gt;

Another tip for you - ZenPacks are great but... you want to create the same capability for reports - so you have a ITIL, CoBIT themed report suite - get those going and people can then more easily understand the business value and how to mix the Zenoss proposition into the IT operations management - it might sound obvious but my experience thus far is that everyone wants reports and each one...</span><br/><span>[10-May-2007 12:27:21] &lt;ed___&gt;
