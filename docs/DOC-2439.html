dorferiferon : no idea how to achieve it though</span><br/><span> [10-Oct-2008 16:28:24] **dorferiferon&gt; raddy: if tomcat will give you the output you can use a script called from snmp on the machine you are monitoring and run graphs. i have not delved into the management on that yet. i check for some processes remotely from my monitoring server and stop/start stuff that is running that way.</span><br/><span> [10-Oct-2008 16:29:14] **dorferiferon&gt;

i suspect your not restarting your stuff daily</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 15:55:15] **nemo_&gt; i run a script before and after out production day to clean up processes, restart things etc</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 15:55:46] **nemo_&gt; xtea, zenmodeller should do that for you.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 15:56:58] **xtea&gt; nemo_: zenmodeller timeouts at 180 seconds, however if i do snmpbulkget from the commandline i can get all the results inside 180 seconds</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 15:57:23] **xtea&gt;

not *</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 17:18:22] **daMaestro&gt; nemo_, i understand</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 17:19:26] **texasthunder&gt; hey guys</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 17:19:44] **daMaestro&gt; nemo_, however, our monitoring box is a dell 2950 with 8 cores, 12GB of ram, SSD for the RRD data and 7.2k sata raid5 for the os (and zenoss). it's a dedicated box with a bonded gbit link to our network core... and it still likes to choke every once in a while with ~250 devices</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 17:20:50] **daMaestro&gt; nemo_, it actually holds it's own pretty well. we adjusted everything to poll every minute and the rrds are very aggressive</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 17:21:05] **daMaestro&gt; nemo_, still need to do a little tuning though</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 17:22:03] **daMaestro&gt; hmm only 4 cores @ 2.33GHz</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 17:22:15] **daMaestro&gt; still, should be able to power through most anything we throw at it</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 17:40:06] **texasthunder&gt;

every thursday at 11am central is the normal schedule</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:44:15] **cgibbons&gt; but at least one of us is here now, for better or worse </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:44:23] **texasthunder&gt; great</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:44:41] **texasthunder&gt; how do i limit the number of days in the event console to show ?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:47:39] **npmccallum&gt; jcastro: yo</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:50:39] **jcastro&gt;

I think everyone else was though</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:54:16] **cgibbons&gt; texasthunder: what's your 'delete history events older than (days)' setting on the Event Manager / Edit page?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:55:13] **texasthunder&gt; 0</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:55:20] **texasthunder&gt; i guess thats bad duh</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:55:37] **cgibbons&gt; looks like my default here is 7</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:55:45] **texasthunder&gt; ok 7 it is</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:55:46] **texasthunder&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:56:13] **cgibbons&gt; ack it's matt!</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 18:56:45] **mrayzenoss&gt; I heard my name</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:05:36] **muppethouse&gt; I've got a quick question if there is somebody out there with experience creating custom Device Templates</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:06:07] **texasthunder&gt; depends if you're using SNMP or Commands as a data source</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:06:14] **muppethouse&gt; snmp</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:06:21] **texasthunder&gt; i just used it today to create my first oracle checks</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:06:21] **muppethouse&gt; everything is working... kinda</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:07:25] **muppethouse&gt; cool. I created a template that grabs a handful of data sources from the private Riverhead MIB, all counter64, and tries to draw a nice pretty picture</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:08:20] **muppethouse&gt; when I snmpget, or do the little test thing from the template section of the web interface all works just fine, I receive in a nice big integer</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:09:07] **muppethouse&gt; but for some of the variables instead of taking the delta between the two samples to get a rate it looks like it is treating it as a guage rather than counter</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:09:19] **muppethouse&gt; ... but they are a counter.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:17:08] **boingolov&gt; is there anywhere that the severities recognized by zensyslog are enumerated?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:17:21] **boingolov&gt; they don't seem to follow the definitions from sys/syslog.h</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:18:08] **boingolov&gt; moreover, they don't seem to follow the same order. for instance, sys/syslog.h gives the most severe errors as 0, then go up in decreasing severity up until 7</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:18:38] **boingolov&gt; with zenoss, I'm getting info severity stuff as severity 1</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:18:47] **boingolov&gt; and more critical stuff as 4</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:22:20] **justizin&gt; is it not possible to have more than one tcp monitor for a given host, for the same protocol, e.g. http, on multiple ports?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:22:55] **muppethouse&gt; justizin: yes, you can nave more than one ip service monitor</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:23:50] **therealnemo&gt; boingolov, yes its an odity, why it didnt mirror unix severities is a mystery</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:23:56] **therealnemo&gt; perhaps mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:23:58] **therealnemo&gt; </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:24:04] **therealnemo&gt; knows ..</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:24:16] therealnemo is now known as `m3</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:24:19] **muppethouse&gt; the severities are more similar to Netcool right?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:24:40] **`m3&gt; hmm i think they are just not the same as unix</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:24:45] **texasthunder&gt; i've come to the conclusion zenoss is learned through time and trial/error and not documentation </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:25:12] **`m3&gt; reading the code is the only true method </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:25:24] **justizin&gt; muppethouse: when i add a new ipservice of type http, for another port, it removes a previously configured one</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:25:30] **justizin&gt; can't even have http-alt and http</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:25:33] **texasthunder&gt; for the truly gifted python master yes</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:25:43] **`m3&gt; texasthunder, which isnt me :/</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:25:55] **texasthunder&gt; hear hear</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:26:15] **`m3&gt; why dont we have a severities at least in the right colours in the list</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:26:18] **muppethouse&gt; justizin: I would go into the classes &gt; services &gt; IpService and make sure that there is a service defined for the ports you would like to monitor</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:26:27] **`m3&gt; that way we dont have to work it out ourselves</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:26:40] **`m3&gt; i asked zenoss for that directly 6 months ago </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:26:54] **justizin&gt; muppethouse: well, there is already http-alt, but i know what you're talking about, i created some process classes for zeo and debian's 'apache2' process</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:26:59] * justizin gives it a shot</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:27:42] **texasthunder&gt; does edahl ever come on here?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:28:40] **muppethouse&gt; so if you wanted to monitor a zenoss box, you may typically be running a service on 80 and 8080, so you should be able to create a new service under IpService for port 8080 and then just add it to the device.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:29:36] **cgibbons&gt; not much anymore, texasthunder</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:30:00] **texasthunder&gt; I sent him an email about a certain ticket regarding email alert aggregation</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:30:14] **texasthunder&gt; any chance that will happen in the next release?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:30:14] **`m3&gt; muppethouse, zenoss boxes in a cluster all connect to a hubhost</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:30:15] **justizin&gt; wierd, yah, when i typed 8080 as the port into an http service i created, it changed itself to http-alt, and pointed at a location in /Services/IpService in the UI, but doesn't seem to be there..</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:30:27] **`m3&gt; that includes monitoring of each node</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:30:39] **justizin&gt; i see what you're saying, no big.. yah i'm monitoring zenoss and another zope on the same box, actually, at least until zenoss runs in a newer zope.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:33:06] **muppethouse&gt; I don't see http-alt defined on my install - looked under the registered subclass of ipservice.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:33:07] **cgibbons&gt; which ticket # was it, texasthunder?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:34:03] **justizin&gt; yah it came up in auto-complete.. wierd..</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:34:43] **justizin&gt; should i be creating new service classes at IpService level, or under Registered?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:34:54] **justizin&gt; does it matter? I assume it's acquisition based..</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:34:56] **texasthunder&gt; cgibbons i'll look it up</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:36:22] **justizin&gt; i tried to add a new service into the Registered container, and it doesn't have an option to input the port.. do i need to follow some convention? i see the edit form is different for existing items.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 19:36:37] **muppethouse&gt; justizin: I don't know, but I suspect it just has to do with your own organizational choices. I suspect since it is auto completing there is already a port 8080 defined in Registered.

ahh, okay, wow</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:14:38] **boingolov&gt; it goes 10 20 30 40 50</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:14:57] **boingolov&gt; so setting it to "3" was making it probably even more chatty than the default</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:15:51] **`m3&gt; haha , i put syslogs on there own server there were so many events</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:19:14] **boingolov&gt; I just set mine to only worry with the errors on up</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:19:25] **boingolov&gt;

kool</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:40:15] **boingolov&gt; starting it up again now, but this is nothing I haven't done in the past</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:40:30] **`m3&gt; gotcha, well i am about out of suggestions</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:40:48] **boingolov&gt; well, you've given some good ones, and I'll definitely look into that regex stuff</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:41:03] **boingolov&gt; that will be useful regardless of whether or not I get the threshold stuff working</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:41:29] **`m3&gt; kool</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:42:37] **boingolov&gt; and I guess once I get the eventClass stuff behaving properly, the transform would then be something I'd apply to the class?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:42:42] **boingolov&gt; assuming threshold is a no go?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:43:17] **`m3&gt; yup that would be the correct order</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:43:29] **boingolov&gt; coolio</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:44:16] **`m3&gt;

i dont think so, i think it happens automatically</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:44:51] **boingolov&gt; okay</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:45:00] **justizin&gt; may need to restart the python process..</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:45:03] **`m3&gt;

yeh very enterprise</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 22:55:40] **justizin&gt; hm, odd, i have errors for threshold of utilization 75% on my he.net ipv6 tunnel interface</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:44:03] **Pikoro&gt; can someone point me to a doc that explains how to map a MIB to a certain group or class of device?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:44:48] **`m3&gt; best way i can explain, is to say you dont, google on zenmib</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:45:37] **Pikoro&gt; well i got the mib imported with dependencies and all that, but it seems i'll have to make all kinds of stuff manually.. spent all day googling it yesterday.. heheh</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:46:29] **Pikoro&gt; i just want to make it so when i add a certain class of device it's automatically polled for certain things..</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:46:47] **`m3&gt; but that has little to do with mibs</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:46:51] **Pikoro&gt; without having to spend 4 or 5 days making all the probes manually</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:47:49] **`m3&gt; you must be looking for something else</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:48:00] **`m3&gt; it doesnt sound like a mib to me</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:48:12] **`m3&gt; sounds more like collector plugins</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:48:34] **Pikoro&gt; yah, that might be more appropriate</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:48:37] **`m3&gt; and modelling devices</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:48:50] **Pikoro&gt; i have 417 items i need to probe for these devices</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:49:02] **Pikoro&gt; so i'm trying not to have to create all the collectors manually i guess</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:49:48] **`m3&gt; as long as they are ipservices, or pretty normal you should be ok</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:50:00] **`m3&gt; or at least most of em</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:50:26] **`m3&gt; you can always use ssh comands / shell script</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:50:26] **Pikoro&gt; they're not standard services or items to probe..</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:50:47] **Pikoro&gt; cpu temp, # of hotspot users, things like that</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:51:28] **`m3&gt; i think there might be a zenoss agent you can install on a machine</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:51:53] **Pikoro&gt; nah, they're a custom embedded linux build with no access to install new scripts or anything</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:52:22] **Pikoro&gt; otherwise I wouldn't be here </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:52:27] **`m3&gt; lol, ok, so how do you plan to tackle that</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:52:54] **`m3&gt; can it take an ssh shell command</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:53:37] **Pikoro&gt; i can ssh in but it's a custom shell.. i can write scripts to access it via api but that brings me to a slightly different problem</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:54:31] **Pikoro&gt; i have one of these routers that opens a pppoe session and updates it's dynamic dns entry automatically. Behind this router are 12 more just like it but accessable on different ports.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:55:03] **Pikoro&gt; it seems zenoss can't handle multiple devices with the same dns name or ip but on diffferent ports</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:55:13] **Pikoro&gt; is there a workaround for that?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:55:21] **`m3&gt; well i think it assumes they are services on the same device</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:55:53] **`m3&gt; i am not sure really, never really come accross the problem</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:55:59] **Pikoro&gt; the other monitoring software i use (which i am trying to migrate to zenoss from) lets me create a seperate device and probe that device on a different port</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:56:07] **`m3&gt; sounds like you running stuff through an adsl connection or something</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:56:18] **`m3&gt; only 1 public ip etc</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:56:20] **Pikoro&gt; my main router port forwards snmp to a different port for each one</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:56:50] **`m3&gt; hm i think the snmp port can be altered</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:57:03] **`m3&gt; but i dont know if you can do it with identical names</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:57:14] **Pikoro&gt; yah, but all it does is update the entry for my gateway router</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:57:26] **`m3&gt; yeh i had a feeling it might</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:57:46] **`m3&gt; the truth is, an intelligent guess is that its not a seperate device</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:57:56] **`m3&gt; because it has the same name, thats kind of a standard </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:58:11] **`m3&gt; so i dont think zenoss will change , but hey i dont speak for them</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:58:17] **justizin&gt;

ahh, so you can monitor virtualnamedhosts</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:59:06] **Pikoro&gt; these are all wireless access points...</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:59:28] **justizin&gt; ah ok</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2008 23:59:38] **justizin&gt;

If you're not doing Windows, or WMI anyway, you could stop ZenWin</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 12:05:23] **jmp242&gt; and ZenEventLog</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 12:05:47] **jmp242&gt; You need ZenModeler to actually model a device for future polling</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 12:06:02] **jmp242&gt; but once you've done that, you could turn it off and not automatically re-look every 6 hours</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 12:06:11] **jmp242&gt; just remember you will need to turn it back on when you add a device</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 12:06:44] **jmp242&gt; ZenTrap is used for SNMP traps, if you're not recieving traps I guess you could turn that off.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 12:07:04] **jmp242&gt; zenSyslog is the same for recieving syslog forwards</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 12:07:21] **jmp242&gt;

jmp242 : as i already told, zenoss is currently installed in the server that to be monitored, at any time zenoss will be able to ping it's own device, so the results won't be accurate</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 12:32:41] **jmp242&gt; wait - you only want to monitor one server, the one that Zenoss is installed on?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 12:33:05] **jmp242&gt; that's not a normal usecase for Zenoss . . .

sn1ffer72:&#160; thanks</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:49:19] **nemo2&gt; boingolov, can you post some of the original regex too</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:49:32] **nemo2&gt; the date stuff is auto done</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:49:35] **nemo2&gt; you start from the date</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:49:39] **boingolov&gt; sure</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:49:40] **nemo2&gt; after the date sorry</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:49:50] **pjz&gt; boingolov: are you sure that's a space between the timestamp/ps and the component? could it be a tab instead?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:50:02] **boingolov&gt; yes, I do. but the date is relatively unimportant, especially since the base system seems to run at GMT</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:50:04] **pjz&gt; either way, won't hurt to replace it with \s+</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:50:13] **boingolov&gt; pjz, good point</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:50:24] **nemo2&gt; boingolov, what i meant is dont start your regex on the date</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:50:28] **boingolov&gt; does \s in py cover all whitespace, including tab?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:50:30] **nemo2&gt; its auto done somehow</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:50:37] **pjz&gt; boingolov: I think so</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:50:57] **nemo2&gt; its already somehow covered , thats the mistake i made </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:51:24] **boingolov&gt; pjz, the thing is, I believe that regex is working because it now properly splits out the facility</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:51:27] **nemo2&gt; try a more permissive .*WARNING:</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:51:28] **nemo2&gt; or so</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:51:32] **boingolov&gt; err, not facility, but the component</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:52:31] **boingolov&gt; but from my reading of the code (IANAPP - i am not a python programmer), it looks like in the abasence of an eventClass of eventClassKey variable in the regex that matches, it will go for component and try to find a mapping for an event class .</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:53:06] **nemo2&gt; boingolov, i suggest you compare yours starting with the date, and the other default regex's</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:53:11] **boingolov&gt; and in the absence of a mapping for given component (vmkernel in this case), it will go to Unknown , correct?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:53:22] **nemo2&gt; indeed</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:53:50] **nemo2&gt; you can only map those with a component</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:53:56] **nemo2&gt; its very confusing </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:54:26] **boingolov&gt; it makes sense that if it's not parsing the vmware syslog format, it probably doesn't know much about its components either</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:54:28] **nemo2&gt; if a message comes in with a component, and its still in unknown</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:54:34] **nemo2&gt; you can map it to a class</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:54:37] **boingolov&gt; right</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:54:44] **nemo2&gt; but with no component it cant work</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:54:46] **boingolov&gt; and I've successfully done that with messages from crond (lower case)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:54:54] **nemo2&gt; kool.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:54:57] **boingolov&gt; it had one for upper case CROND, but didn't seem to want to match</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:55:17] **nemo2&gt; not a biggy once you get used to cleaning them up</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:55:32] **nemo2&gt; and of course if done right you dont see it in unknown again</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:55:39] **boingolov&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:56:15] **boingolov&gt; okay, after I do an event class mapping, what do I have to restart in order to make it active, short of restarting the whole stack?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:56:57] **nemo2&gt; mapping ?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:57:08] **nemo2&gt; i would restart zensyslog and zeo</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:57:14] **nemo2&gt; zeoctl</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 19:57:16] **boingolov&gt; okay</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:05:04] **pjz&gt; anyone monitor debian boxes? do you put anything on them other than snmpd for monitoring?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:05:22] **pjz&gt; are there extra mibs I should be putting somewhere?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:16:57] **jb&gt; anyone here using AD auth in enterprise&gt;?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:17:11] **nemo2&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:17:16] **jb&gt; so.. how does it work?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:17:19] **jb&gt; i haven configured it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:17:23] **jb&gt; s/haven/have</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:17:31] **nemo2&gt; as described in the manual is about all i can say</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:17:34] **jb&gt; obviously, the users need to be created</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:17:36] **jb&gt; in zenoss..</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:17:42] **jb&gt; so then does it look at AD for the password?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:17:44] **nemo2&gt; our ad structure changed, i fixed it, it keeps on working</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:17:48] **jb&gt; the docs really don't say.. they just say how to configure it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:18:00] **nemo2&gt; not sure if it only auths against or somehow takes the hash or whatever</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:18:12] **jb&gt; but, you created local users in zen, right?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:18:16] **nemo2&gt;

its ad, your users are in the AD</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:18:34] **nemo2&gt; most people are default zenuser</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:18:45] **nemo2&gt; i make manual changes to peoples user on zenoss side</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:18:52] **nemo2&gt; you can edit each user</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:19:05] **jb&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:19:06] **jb&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:19:13] **jb&gt; so all of your AD users are showing up in the users panel on zen?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:27:53] * nemo2 nods</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:52:18] **boingolov&gt; okay, after more digging I realized that vmware's syslog output is mostly being matched by the unix syslog ones, with a couple of exceptions. also, I was wrong earlier that my mapping for crond was successful</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:52:27] **boingolov&gt; some assumptions I've had are apparently invalid</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 20:56:58] **boingolov&gt; is there an easy way to turn on debug logging?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 21:02:41] **boingolov&gt; ahhhhh, so THAT is what the logging threshold does</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2008 21:02:53] **boingolov&gt; that's for internal logging, not some sort of filter on what syslog severity it looks at</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2008 21:12:16] **boingolov&gt;
