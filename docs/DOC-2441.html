This should be almost nothing. Give it a shot and see. You can always go to /manage and undo your transaction if stuff is removed.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:16:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; what do you mean by "contained in the zenpack"?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:16:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, forgot about the undo feature, that saved my arse one time<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:16:35] &lt;cluther&gt; I use contained in a purely technical sense. Every object in the ZODB has a primary path that contains it. For a MIB this would be /zport/dmd/Mibs/....<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:16:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, guess I'll give it a go..<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:16:53] &lt;cluther&gt; So the MIB is contained within Mibs, not the ZenPack.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:17:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so it technically shouldn't touch the Mibs then in theory<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:17:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; So if a Zenpack installs mibs, and you remove the Zenpack, it won't uninstall the mibs?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:17:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, this is taking a while, I was thinking it'd be more instant, this is basically like doing a --remove<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:17:58] &lt;cluther&gt; twm1010: By default on removal it will go through all of its "packables" and remove them too. rmatte is trying to avoid doing that.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:18:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: it will, that's what I'm trying to avoid<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:18:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; well it's running, hopefully it doesn't take hours to run through<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:18:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was hoping this would only take a few seconds<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:18:51] &lt;cluther&gt; rmatte: Even if it works it probably wouldn't be instantaneous. All of the MIB notes/etc still have to have one side of a relationship removed from them.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:19:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; oooh, it's done<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:19:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I assume I have to commit?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:19:11] &lt;cluther&gt; yes<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:19:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:20:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; if this works then it will be quite nice, hopefully it boosts performance like I expect it will<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:20:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, done the commit, now to test...<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:21:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I shouldn't have to restart zope or anything?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:21:20] &lt;cluther&gt; No.. it should just be fast now.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:21:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:22:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; a zenpack --list certainly ran through much faster<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:22:55] &lt;cluther&gt; Some of the other things that should be faster would be adding a new data source, going to zProperties and starting zenhub.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:23:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; adding new data sources hang forever sometimes<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:23:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; drives me nuts<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:23:34] &lt;cluther&gt; We're trying to figure out a better way to handle these massive ZenPacks.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:23:59] &lt;cluther&gt; We really weren't thinking about ZenPacks with tens of thousands of objects at the time.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:24:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm sure it's not the easiest thing in the world to fix, seems to be well rooted in everything<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:24:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; wow, zProperties pages are loading mint fast now<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:24:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; and this lab box is running on a pretty slow VM too<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:24:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; looks like success<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:24:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll do some more testing to be sure, but it's definitely looking good<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:28:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup, that's the fix<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:29:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; That's not too bad really.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:29:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I restarted zenoss, going to make sure these heartbeat failures go away<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:31:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: that's a better solution, install the ZenPack (yeh, it'll take a while, but it's better than moving the Mibs to a Cisco folder by hand), then run...<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:31:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; In zendmd:<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:31:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; dmd.ZenPackManager.packs._delObject('ZenPacks.Nova.Cisco.Mibs')<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:31:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; commit()<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:31:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:32:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll do some more testing and once I'm 100% positive that it hasn't negatively impacted anything else (which I doubt it will), I'll have Matt throw it up on the ZenPack page as a suggested workaround for the performance issues<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:32:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; should make quite a few people happy<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:33:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; Thanks for the assistance Chet, per usual<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:33:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; Does the Zenpack put the mibs into an organizer as well?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:33:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, the ZenPack does<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:33:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; that alone is worth it <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:33:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; it puts them in an organizer called Cisco<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:33:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, when I moved them in to the organizer by hand initially it took me like a half hour<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:33:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is ridiculous<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:33:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; indeed, any more than 40 and you get a timeout or something?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:34:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; pretty much<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:34:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I had to do it 40 at a time<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:34:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; i get timeouts changing device classes, haven't figured out why yet.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:34:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; like just browsing between?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:34:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; or moving them around?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:35:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; moving a discovered device to it's proper class<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:35:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; seems to do it the worst with large switches<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:35:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; weird, I never have problems with it<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:36:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; neither does my test box<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:36:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; alsoinstalled from stack<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:36:20] &lt;twm1010&gt; my test box is SUSE, my prod is RHEL5<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:36:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; I find that putting a checkmark next to a device name and selecting to move it to a new class rather than doing it right from the device page tends to work better for whatever reason<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:37:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; it seems to have quieted down since i first installed, things move decently quick now, but i still can't really move more than one or two devices simultaneously<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:37:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; so far I'm loving Ubuntu Server 8.04 with stack installed Zenoss<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:37:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; in the past i could move 20+...<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:37:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; seems to work beautifully<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:37:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; and Ubuntu is so easy to maintain due to the kick ass package manager<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:37:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; aptitude++<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:37:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; Indeed, I like it as well... but the boss man said run it on RHEL, so I did.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:37:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:38:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not a fan of RedHat, they have too much proprietary crap in it<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:38:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; Well, you have to figure they have to, to be able to support it.<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:38:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; true enough<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:38:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; we test some stuff on CentOS from time to time, but we're currently an Ubuntu shop<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:39:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; time for a victory smoke, bbiab<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:44:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; back<br/><span> [08-Jul-2009 13:45:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: if you're running it on a fairly power server you may want to take a look at: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/Members/fdeckert/how-to-tweak-zenoss/">http://www.zenoss.com/Members/fdeckert/how-to-tweak-zenoss/</a><br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:47:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure if you're made any changes like that already, but adding the 'parallel &lt;number&gt;' lines for daemons that are used heavily and adding 'workers &lt;number&gt;' to the zenhub config can drastically increase performance on multi-threaded systems<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:47:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; fairly powerful* server rather<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:54:04] &lt;dberger&gt; what's the difference between manager and zenmanager?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 13:54:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure, but I always use Manager since ZenManager never seems to work properly<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:10:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: you around?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:10:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:10:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you see the bits above about the workaround for the Cisco Mibs pack?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:13:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; it works like a charm, it'd be worth throwing it up on the page for the ZenPack<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:16:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; could apply to any other large ZenPacks as well<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:20:06] &lt;venturaville&gt; what is the syntax for referring to another graph point in the RPN field?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:20:20] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: thanks for the performance link, looking at doing some of these now<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:20:36] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm using a DL380G4 HP for my Zenoss box, 4GB ram<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:20:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: no problem, they've helped a lot on the box that we're using to monitor 350 devices on<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:20:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; what's the processor in that thing?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:21:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; shows up at 4 x 3.2Ghz Xeons<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:21:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; I would guess dual hyper-threaded<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:22:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; probably<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:23:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; the rackmount I have at home has quad xeon with hyperthreading &amp; shows up as 8 1.6GHz CPUs when it's really 4 1.6GHz<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:23:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's still a nice chunk of processing power there, running multiple VMs on it or just a main OS?<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:23:54] &lt;twm1010&gt; RHEL runs native, no virtualization<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:24:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool, then those performance enhancements will definitely help you out<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:24:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; should do the trick, I almost got an IBM x3650, dual quad-cores, 8 GB ram, but it got snatched for another project<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:26:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; venturaville: I have 1 RPN thing that I did a while ago, let me check<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:28:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; venturaville: ok, you'll see "Available RRD Variables" at the bottom when you're viewing the graph point, you'll only see them provided that they are lower in the list in Graph Points<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:28:49] &lt;venturaville&gt; right<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:28:51] &lt;venturaville&gt; got that<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:28:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; sorry, higher in the list<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:29:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; so in this case I wanted the percent of memory used, so my RPN expression was: Total,/,100,*<br/> [08-Jul-2009 14:30:03] &lt;rmatte&gt;

It'll probably work fine; InitializeClass() is a Zope thing that registers it so you can add it through the ZMI<br/> [09-Jul-2009 10:15:16] &lt;bwest&gt; ckrough:I know that is an enterprise feature<br/> [09-Jul-2009 10:15:37] &lt;__ian__&gt; Jane_Curry: What you want is a simple migrate script to make sure the property is set to the correct value.<br/> [09-Jul-2009 10:15:47] &lt;ckrough&gt; bwest: it is? I'm an Enterprise user, havent seen that. Is this recent?<br/> [09-Jul-2009 10:15:52] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; .. so the good practice seems to be to set both the zPythonClass and to Initialize<br/> [09-Jul-2009 10:16:32] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; __ian__ - not sure what you mean about "a simple migrate script"<br/> [09-Jul-2009 10:16:39] &lt;bwest&gt; ckrough:I should have said I think, I thought that was the whole point of the global dashboard<br/> [09-Jul-2009 10:16:40] &lt;__ian__&gt; Jane_Curry: Actually, you don't even need a migrate script, since you're creating the device class in this pack, right?<br/> [09-Jul-2009 10:16:57] &lt;ckrough&gt; bwest: Ill review the later versions again. Im still running 2.3.3<br/> [09-Jul-2009 10:17:27] &lt;__ian__&gt; Jane_Curry: Migrate script was red herring.

That's very, very messy and backwards though, eh? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:33:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so I went and talked to a couple of the devs, and they pointed out that you could probably just use syslog<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:33:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; have the DVRs send their monitoring info in syslog, then set up rules based on what they're sending<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:34:25] &lt;zenChild&gt; etank:&#160; one sec.&#160; in a conversation.<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:34:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: you won't have the stats and graphs, but you'll be able to just send from the DVR the things you care about<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:35:28] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: hmm, interesting! - is there no way to have the stats and graphs though? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:36:00] &lt;etank&gt; zenChild: np<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:36:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: probably if you do some work with the transforms...<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:36:04] &lt;venturaville&gt; actually I have a wicked idea ... you can have a data collector connect back to zendmd and fetch the last event from the device and grab data out of it<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:36:10] &lt;venturaville&gt; *grins evilly*<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:36:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: or a 2-phase solution where the syslog output is written to a log file and then you use a Command datasource to parse it<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:37:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you could get your graphs that way<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:37:41] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: that could work - I mean currently I use logcheck which does just that, except emails the information instead of sending it to another syslog server<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:38:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, that would actually be easier to test and debug as well<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:38:39] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: so I'll write a script that will check all snmpd data as well as whatever else I'm interested in, log it to syslog - then use logcheck to get just the juicy, unparsed stuff, and then a separate script to retry endlessly to send it to a syslog server -- that could work!<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:39:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, that sounds feasible<br/><span> [10-Jul-2009 09:40:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Here's an example of a manipulating an external system and pushing it into RRD (in this case a database, but a shell command could be used) </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/Members/cluther/licenseEventCheck.py/view">http://www.zenoss.com/Members/cluther/licenseEventCheck.py/view</a><br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:41:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; This example queries a database and monitors how many license keys are in use<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:43:29] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: thanks for that - so when I do ZenScriptBase(connect=True).dmd<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:43:45] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: I can just specify it to connect to the zemboss host online?<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:43:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; does anyone here have a Zenoss report build that reports interface errors?<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:44:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; built* rather<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:45:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: I'm guessing that's running as the 'zenoss' user<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:45:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; but yeah<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:45:47] &lt;zenChild&gt; etank: I really didn't do anything out of the ordinary... just followed the OpenVPN docs. The zenoss server is just an OpenVPN client into the private network. The big thing is to put some thought behind your address ranges in case you have to be a client into many private networks. And if you don't have any CA tools to manage the certificates I would suggest something like TinyCA.<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:46:27] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: hmm, thanks for that, so for monitoring information I could use a series of scripts like that and create a class that will queue and retry<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:46:40] &lt;etank&gt; zenChild: i see.<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:46:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: good luck<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:47:45] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: are there any examples of using syslog data for events?<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:47:50] &lt;zenChild&gt; etank:&#160; when you're setting it up you can ping me here if you are having issues.<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:49:18] &lt;etank&gt; zenChild: thanks. we have a cisco vpn device at the location. im wondering if i can just pass through that.<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:49:34] &lt;etank&gt; if so then i wouldnt even need OpenVPN<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:49:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: if you just point something generating syslog at your Zenoss server it'll show up in the Event Console<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:49:56] &lt;zenChild&gt; etank: should be able to. You could use vpnc or the cisco vpn client and things should work the same.<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:50:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: they usually go to INFO if they're /Unknown<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:50:46] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: ok, thanks - I'll probably be back <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [10-Jul-2009 09:50:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; take a look at Jane Curry's Event Management paper for further details: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/papers/jcurry.html">http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/papers/jcurry.html</a><br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:50:50] &lt;etank&gt; zenChild: would you cron the connections though? or just leave them open. we are planning on using enterprise with remote collectors<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:51:49] &lt;zenChild&gt; I just have my OpenVPN connect at boot time and keep it running.<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:52:28] &lt;etank&gt; cool. we will have to pass that by IT security before we can set that up. but it seems like a plan.<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:57:36] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: thanks for that <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:58:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; all of Jane Curry's stuff is worth reading, very good<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:58:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; kind of fills in some gaps in the admin guide<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:58:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, she's got some training sessions in Europe this summer<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:58:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:58:44] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: oh yeah? where in europe?<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:59:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; say amsterdam, or ireland, I'll have my company fly me over <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [10-Jul-2009 09:59:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/products/courses/zenoss-events.html">http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/products/courses/zenoss-events.html</a><br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:59:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; London<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:59:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and something later in Austria<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:59:37] &lt;hackeron&gt; maidenhead!<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:59:42] &lt;hackeron&gt; that's a 40 minute drive for me, lol<br/> [10-Jul-2009 09:59:57] &lt;hackeron&gt; if only I had 1200 quid, lol<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:00:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; the minute you have a week long workshop on writing collector plugins I'm there<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:00:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd love developer workshops, would be nice if they were available via webex<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:05:19] &lt;etank&gt; rmatte: i agree<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:05:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; is there a guide somewhere that explains writing them?<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:06:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; or is it one of those: dig through other people's code and fly by the seat of your pants type thing?<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:07:23] &lt;etank&gt; i wish some of the community packs had better documentation :/<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:07:35] &lt;etank&gt; they install but now idea how to set them up properly<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:08:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; such as?<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:09:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I haven't found the setup of any of them to be overly complicated, except for httpmon which was a bit of a trial and error type deal at first<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:12:51] &lt;etank&gt; httpmon was one and the other was the predictive threshold one<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:16:09] &lt;etank&gt; it could be because i am still fairly new to zenoss too<br/> [10-Jul-2009 10:18:05] &lt;eidolon&gt; question. if i have emplates defined for, say, MySQL servers, and i add a new host, and i want that template to be used on the new host, I use More-&gt;Templates, then Bind Template, yes? and pick my /Device/MySQL tempalte? that will apply the mysql template to the device, not copy it?

(1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.716 = catalyst296024TT)<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:25:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; you submitted that patch like 4 months ago?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:25:36] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: it was quite a while ago<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:25:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: no problem...<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:26:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, in Zenoss, click on "Products" on the left under the "Classes" section<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:26:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; let me know when that page has loaded<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:26:32] &lt;ckrough&gt; kk<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:26:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; once it has, click on "Cisco", you'll see it in the list<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:26:48] &lt;ckrough&gt; yup<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:27:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, now, notice that there's a list of model numbers with corresponding OID values?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:27:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's how it recognizes them<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:27:10] &lt;ckrough&gt; yup<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:27:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you wanted to add a new product in, you'd have to find out what OID corresponds to that model, and add it to the list<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:27:33] &lt;ckrough&gt; and where does that list come from?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:27:40] &lt;ckrough&gt; manually? eew<br/><span> [15-Jul-2009 14:27:52] &lt;ckrough&gt; I was assuming it could come from </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.oidview.com/mibs/9/CISCO-PRODUCTS-MIB.html">http://www.oidview.com/mibs/9/CISCO-PRODUCTS-MIB.html</a><br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:27:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, although a lot of stuff is already included with Zenoss<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:28:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's a huge list of Cisco devices already included, as you can see<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:28:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if you find any missing, you can add them, but I doubt it'll happen often<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:29:19] &lt;ckrough&gt; I think Cisco changes the numbers sometimes. for example, the one that caught my eye today is a 24 port 2960, 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.716<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:29:44] &lt;ckrough&gt; we have plenty of 2960 24's out there, but suddenly some new ones are .716<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:29:51] &lt;ckrough&gt; lemme check what some of the others return<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:30:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; it might be a 2960-S or whatever<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:30:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; might have some special model designation<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:30:14] &lt;ckrough&gt; yeah<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:32:35] &lt;ckrough&gt; yup, all the same number, just a handful that didnt get recognized. I was on the wrong track... thanks for the help<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:33:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; no problem<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:34:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; what version of Zenoss are you using by the way?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:35:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; because I have a 2.3.3 box that hardly ever correctly recognizes the OIDs that are actually in the list, yours is apparently working fairly well, just wondering if you're using 2.4.1 or 2.4.2 (which would indicate that the patch was applied)<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:37:45] &lt;ckrough&gt; 2.2.4<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:38:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, that might be before the problem popped up in the first place<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:38:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; because I assume that it did initially work at some point and then some change caused it to break<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:38:26] &lt;ckrough&gt; thats one of the reasons we are still on 2.2.4. we like to let you guys do the beta testing <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:38:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, that's why we have a lab now<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:38:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I didn't have one before, but we finally picked up a bunch of equipment<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:39:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; we actually have a SAN for our lab<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:39:23] &lt;ckrough&gt; Yeah, Im running 2.4 in a lab, but there is just no way to replicate the production env accurately in the lab. we can get close, but its never a 100% test<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:39:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; we can't fire it up though until we get adequate A/C installed in that room<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:39:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; we fired it up the one day and it was like the carribean in there<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:39:47] &lt;ckrough&gt; heh, I feel your pain<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:40:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'd be fine in the winter, we'd just open the window, super ghetto server room.<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:40:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; good thing we don't host our production stuff in there<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:45:03] &lt;ckrough&gt; your at an ISP, correct?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:45:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, we're a managed services provider<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:46:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; we monitor equipment for clients<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:46:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; (a NOC)<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:46:26] &lt;ckrough&gt; ah, so your zenoss installs are segmented by customer?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:46:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; for the most part, we do have 2 shared boxes<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:47:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; the problem with running the shared boxes is that generally smaller clients are on those boxes and they almost always have the standard 192.168 ip range<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:47:41] &lt;ckrough&gt; ouch<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:47:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; so far we've managed to cram 5 clients on the first box and 3 on the second<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:47:49] &lt;ckrough&gt; they allow for overlap in 2.4 right?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:47:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; not in my experience<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:48:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; causes lots of fun issues<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:48:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus you wouldn't want overlap anyways, it wouldn't make sense<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:49:02] &lt;ckrough&gt; ah, thought I read about that somewhere. in the Service Provider release<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:49:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, we're just using core<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:49:23] &lt;ckrough&gt; ... which I dont see on the site now. mrayzenoss was the Service Prodiver concept dropped?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:49:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've had to make all sorts of fun little mods and scripts to get the results that we want<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:50:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; I want to eventually get my monitoring method for the default windows SNMP agent packaged up in to a proper ZenPack with a collector plugin<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:50:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; but first I need to study the developmeny of collector plugins, and also study Rocket's AIX pack, since he's done some cool stuff with the UI<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:51:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ckrough: it's all Enterprise now<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:51:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; then once I'm done with that, I might take a shot at a proper community WMI pack, but they are both ambitious projects that are going to take a long time<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:51:56] &lt;ckrough&gt; yeah, Im wrapping up puppetizing our environment so I can spend more time customizing zenoss. ...crosses fingers...<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:52:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:52:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's a big job<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:52:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; right now I'm designing an automated zenpack update system to push out updates across all our boxes<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:52:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; once we start getting up to like 20 servers it won't make sense to do it by hand anymore<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:52:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: sounds like you're writing Enterprise features <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:52:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: yeh, trying to<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:53:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's pretty complex stuff, especially since I'm just learning python as I go, but I'll get there eventually<br/> [15-Jul-2009 14:54:12] &lt;ckrough&gt;

woah<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:01:07] &lt;straterra&gt; didnt compain on port<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:01:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; good<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:01:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; that must be the right option then<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:01:37] &lt;straterra&gt; I would have thought something else needs to be modified to tell of the new port<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:01:46] &lt;straterra&gt; You know..if the other daemons try to communicate with it<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:01:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never changed the actual zenhub port, just the port on the UI, so I was just guessing<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:01:54] &lt;twm1010&gt; easy add.... look at that... thank you Matt<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:02:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; the other daemons probably find out what port to communicate with it from that config<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:02:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; but maybe there is something that needs to be changed<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:02:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; only way to tell is to model a device<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:02:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it says that it can't connect to zenhub then you know you have an issue<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:02:47] &lt;straterra&gt; So, try to add a device again?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:02:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it connects then you're good<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:02:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:03:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; sometimes it'll say it can't connect the finally connects<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:03:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; so give it a few minutes<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:03:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; then* finally connects, rather<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:04:34] &lt;straterra&gt; it cleared through the jobs<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:05:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:05:26] &lt;straterra&gt; Of course..the snmp community didn't stick<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:05:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; by the way, you do know that you need to have snmp enabled or something for it to really model anything I assume?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:05:31] &lt;straterra&gt; it went back to public..which isn't right<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:05:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you need the community string configured in Zenoss<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:05:37] &lt;straterra&gt; Yeah, snmp is enabled.<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:05:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:05:43] &lt;straterra&gt; I'm migrating from cacti/nagios to this<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:05:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; click on Devices on the left<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:06:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; then click on the zProperties tab<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:06:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; change the zSnmpCommunity value to the key that you want to use<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:06:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; (assuming you're using a global key, if not, then you'll have to set it on a per device basis)<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:07:24] &lt;straterra&gt; So..zenoss looks like with its graphing it can replace nagios and cacti<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:07:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; it can completely replace either, correct<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:07:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; it uses RRDTools just like the rest<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:08:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; it even supports nagios plugins, plus you can write custom scripts to collect data and as long as they output in nagios format you can use them in Zenoss<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:08:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do it all the time<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:09:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; nagios output format is like OK|value1=0 value2=4 value3=8<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:09:20] &lt;straterra&gt; I have a TON of nagios plugins<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:09:30] &lt;straterra&gt; Hand written ones, that is<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:09:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you can use those<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:09:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you need to<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:09:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; but Zenoss' built in functionality may replace a lot of those<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:09:52] &lt;straterra&gt; I likely will<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:10:07] &lt;straterra&gt; So now..I look in perf to make sure snmp is working and all?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:10:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, if SNMP is working it should have populated the OS tab with interfaces, disks, and such<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:10:48] &lt;straterra&gt; it didnt<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:10:54] &lt;straterra&gt; i didnt do anything but change the community, though<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:11:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, right<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:11:10] &lt;rmatte&gt;

@mrayzenoss: Has anyone thought about adding a field for a server's management NIC?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:25:11] &lt;twm1010&gt; I suppose it is technically a separate host, but I'd like to correlate the management NIC with the server its tied to<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:26:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, I follow what you're saying, I don't think I've seen that requested. Feel free to open an enhancement ticket, that'll get it into the feature queue<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:29:10] &lt;schwartz&gt; any takers on the externally populated rrd file thing?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:34:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; schwartz: yeh...<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:34:08] &lt;schwartz&gt; ?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:34:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; first off, what does the script do?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:35:07] &lt;schwartz&gt; so far the script doesn't do anything yet. I'm needing to consolidate a single metric from a bunch of hosts into one rrd so I can effectively use rrd's predict functionality<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:35:35] &lt;schwartz&gt; so since there's no way to get zenoss to add those into a single rrd at collection time, I'm going to have to do it<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:36:51] &lt;schwartz&gt; actually maybe I'll make a separate collector for this and make it a zenpack.<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:38:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need multiple values in a single rrd file?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:39:16] &lt;schwartz&gt; one data source in an rrd file, that's the value of all the hosts metrics added together<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:39:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, that's fairly easy to do<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:39:41] &lt;schwartz&gt; it's email stats, and I've got about a dozen servers that do email, the prediction doesn't work so well when split up<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:39:46] &lt;schwartz&gt; glad to hear it <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:40:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; make the script to collect the data and add it up, then have the script output it in nagios format, so OK|whatever=&lt;value&gt;<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:40:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; then create a command based data source in Zenoss, and create a data point under it called whatever<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:40:25] &lt;schwartz&gt; *nod*<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:40:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; or whatever you want your variable to be called<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:40:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; then create a graph with that datapoint<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:40:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you're done<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:41:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; the script should output "Unknown" if it's not able to properly collect the data<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:41:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's not an absolute requirement<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:41:29] &lt;schwartz&gt; normal nagios behavior then<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:41:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:41:51] &lt;schwartz&gt; I was hoping to avoid having to query the same data twice, as I do want it stored per host as well (with no prediction)<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:42:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; as long as the script is able to collect the data, process it, and output the final value, then Zenoss will be able to pick up that value and graph it as it executes the command each polling cycle<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:42:26] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that's actually better than what I was suggesting<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:42:37] &lt;schwartz&gt; which half led me to say okay, I'll grab the values externally, add it up and have the script itself update all of the rrd files instead of zenoss, which flowed into how to get zenoss to use an rrdfile it isn't updating<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:42:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you could have the script output each value as a datapoint<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:42:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; so OK|server1=&lt;value&gt; server2=&lt;value&gt; total=&lt;value&gt;<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:43:02] &lt;schwartz&gt; huh.<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:43:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; then have it graph each individual server as well as the total<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:43:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; schwartz: yeah, I'm looking for Chet to followup on his link I sent you<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:43:24] &lt;schwartz&gt; thanks!<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:43:33] &lt;schwartz&gt; I'll check out the multiple value thing as well<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:44:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; that multiple value thing is just basically what I'm telling you to do, just less taylored towards what you want to do<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:44:37] &lt;schwartz&gt; *nod*<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:44:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can create one command based datasource that runs your script, then create multiple datapoints beneath it, such as server1, server2, etc...<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:45:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; then as long as the script outputs as OK|server1=24453 server2=2789 or whatever, Zenoss will create RRD files and put the data in to them<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:45:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you can graph based on any of those values<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:46:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could have one graph for the total, and a seperate graph for the servers, or a separate graph for each server, and the total, it's entirely up to you<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:47:46] &lt;schwartz&gt; yeah, I kind of like that. first attempt will be the nagios-like command one, but I would like to rewrite it in python, but will leave that for another day<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:47:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; the datapoint names need to correspond with the output of the script for it to work<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:48:24] &lt;schwartz&gt; good to know, thanks<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:48:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could do the same thing with a python script provided it outputs the same way<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:48:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:48:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I must be going, later folks<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:49:08] &lt;schwartz&gt; yeah, trying to learn the internals of zenoss. one thing I don't like about nagios is that it forks off .. who knows how many process to get your data<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:49:12] &lt;schwartz&gt; night!<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:50:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I'm working on figuring out how to write collector plugins, custom reports, and how to add things to the UI, going to take a while<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:51:00] * rmatte departs<br/> [15-Jul-2009 16:51:55] &lt;straterra&gt;

what exactly are you trying to do?<br/> [15-Jul-2009 17:05:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the zope.cfg is good enough for the UI<br/> [15-Jul-2009 17:06:14] &lt;straterra&gt; I have another daemon on the machine (Not Zenoss related) that's already bound to port 8081 and it needs to stay that way<br/> [15-Jul-2009 17:06:20] &lt;straterra&gt;

but I haven't had a good doc anywhere that cooberates that or explains it<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:10:31] &lt;hackeron&gt; hey, I added the wrong network for auto discovery in the setup - where do I cancel and add the correct network?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:10:38] &lt;rocket&gt; venturaville: ok I think I have it remembered again<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:10:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: go to Settings-&gt;Jobs and cancel it<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:10:55] &lt;rocket&gt; venturaville: zenhub is doing the checking of the thresholds in the checkThresholds function<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:11:01] &lt;venturaville&gt; yep<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:11:09] &lt;venturaville&gt; I have gotten that far now at least<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:11:14] &lt;rocket&gt; venturaville: everytime checkThresholds is run it gets a list of datapoint<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:11:17] &lt;rocket&gt; s<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:11:26] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: thanks, cancelled - how do I run it again for the correct network?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:11:56] &lt;rocket&gt; for that list of datapoints it grabs the rrdTemplate.threshold for it<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:12:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: go to Networks and add it there<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:12:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: or go to Add Device-&gt;Easy Add... and you'll be back in the Wizard<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:12:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, the interface utilization report displays input and output as KB in the report, but appears to export as straight packets<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:12:47] &lt;rocket&gt; so basically its getting MinMaxThresholds object class<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:12:51] * rmatte reviews the code<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:12:52] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: how do I remove the old network?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:13:09] &lt;venturaville&gt; rocket: basically someone here wrapped some items around getMinVal() in MinMaxThreshold.py and it only gets called once<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:13:22] &lt;venturaville&gt; items being ...some logging statements<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:14:12] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: ah, found it, never mind - thanks <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:14:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmmm, when exporting the report it appears to export the straight r.speed, r.input, r.output, and r.total values instead of performing the r.humanBits function on them<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:15:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; though it exports the percentage perfectly fine<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:16:21] &lt;rocket&gt; venturaville: I would gather its run only once when zenhub starts up the first time and is checking that datapoints threshold instance?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:16:32] &lt;venturaville&gt; yep<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:16:49] &lt;venturaville&gt; so it gets a number and uses it, and then never updates it again<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:17:16] &lt;venturaville&gt; unless someone manually hits save on the threshold page<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:17:18] &lt;venturaville&gt; .......<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:18:26] &lt;rocket&gt; venturaville: how else would it be updating that number in your case?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:19:03] &lt;venturaville&gt; the minval filed in the threshold has an equation which includes a getRRDValue call.....<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:21:55] &lt;rocket&gt; venturaville: so its set via a rpn?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:24:17] &lt;venturaville&gt; Min Value = here.getRRDValue('postsummary_total') * .99<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:24:19] &lt;venturaville&gt; in this case<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:24:29] &lt;venturaville&gt; in a Min/Max Threshold<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:24:51] &lt;venturaville&gt; which is fine ... it runs it correctly<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:24:58] &lt;venturaville&gt; and gets a number<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:25:04] &lt;venturaville&gt; but then never changes later.........<br/><span> [16-Jul-2009 13:33:54] &lt;ckrough&gt; rmatte: heh, look what I just ran across: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://forums.zenoss.com/viewtopic.php?t=8664&amp;highlight=bulk">http://forums.zenoss.com/viewtopic.php?t=8664&amp;highlight=bulk</a><br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:33:59] &lt;ckrough&gt; 2) zendevicedump / zendeviceload in $ZENHOME/bin - though they are just harness files for ExportDevices.py and ImportDevices.py in $ZENHOME/Products/ZenRelations.<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:34:03] &lt;ckrough&gt; This gives you a way to dump existing devices out to an xml file, complete with information on device class, performance monitor server, locations, systems and groups.<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:34:12] &lt;ckrough&gt; you were looking for that earlier I think, no?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:44:49] &lt;hackeron&gt; if snmpd wasn't installed on a device during auto detection - will I need to run autodetection again, or will it detect snmpd eventually? - if so how long will it take?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:46:11] &lt;ckrough&gt; hackeron: I believe the default install will remodel (redetect/analyse) devices every 12 hours<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:46:23] &lt;hackeron&gt; ckrough: ok, thanks!<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:46:43] &lt;ckrough&gt; hackeron: it should pick up the details then. You will need to move the device from /Discovered to whatever class makes sense for that device[s] to get the full benefit<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:47:17] &lt;ckrough&gt; hackeron: /Monitors&#160; /Hub&#160;

ckrough: I have an openvpn and zenoss detected the 2 servers connected to the openvpn -- so I should move them from Discovered to Server?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:49:23] &lt;ckrough&gt; hackeron: order a more specific subclass of /Server, yes<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:49:56] &lt;hackeron&gt; ckrough: ok, well, my server is remote, linux and ssh -- should I put them under all 3?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:50:10] &lt;ckrough&gt; hackeron: server/linux is probably what you want<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:50:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; is there any quick way for me to output a list of devices that have local thresholds applied to them?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:50:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: that would be handy <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:50:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; there were a bunch of local thresholds applied to certain servers but our engineer lost the lists of which ones he tuned<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:50:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I don't want to have to go through them 1 by 1<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:50:47] &lt;rmatte&gt;

ckrough: cool, very useful <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> -- ok, it also detected the localhost server on 10.8.0.1 -- should I delete that device?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:51:59] &lt;hackeron&gt; ckrough: (I told it to autodetect on 10.8.0.0/24)<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:52:23] &lt;ckrough&gt; hackeron: I will redetect it in &lt;12hrs if you do <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> But you probably want that so you can see performance data, etc...<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:52:39] &lt;ckrough&gt; hackeron: so no, I wouldnt delete it<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:53:10] &lt;hackeron&gt; ckrough: ok, cool <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> -- also, servers connecting to the openvpn can randomly get assigned different IP addresses each time they connect - how does zenoss handle that?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:53:28] * ckrough looks at mrayzenoss <br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:53:36] &lt;ckrough&gt; I should know that answer, but it slips my mind<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:53:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: poorly<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:53:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: Zenoss uses the IP address to track machines<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:54:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so if the machines are going to get random IPs each time they restart, you may need to do some hacking<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:54:26] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: so if the hostname, all hardware and everything else suddenly changes, it won't care?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:54:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that's why it remodels every 12 hours, to stay on top of changes<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:54:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the idea being small changes of course<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:55:23] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: so say disk utilization keeps changing from 30% on a 2tb drive to 80% on a 300gb drive - it will just silently accept that?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:55:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; remodeling is so intensive though when you're dealing with devices that you are monitoring across slow circuits<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:55:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: I'm not exactly sure, it's more likely it would throw alerts before getting remodeled<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:56:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; the modelling should only take place once and then Zenoss should check very specific things for changes<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:56:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; such as interfaces and disks<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:56:10] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: ah, ok, I'll check that out<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:56:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: assuming you have some sort of control over your DHCP server, you can probably configure it to give the same machines the same IPs every time<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:57:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; dhcpd.conf has those settings<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:57:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and most routers do as well<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:57:28] * mrayzenoss uses an AirPort Extreme configured that way<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:57:32] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: it's not dhcp, it's handled by openvpn<br/> [16-Jul-2009 13:58:02] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: and it seems there are 2 configs, 1 limiting one where you have a separate config for each host, and one where any host with a valid public key can connect and see the server<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:00:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm not super familiar with OpenVPN, but it sounds like the separate config is probably the way to go, probably something you could script<br/><span> [16-Jul-2009 14:01:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Might I recommend </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596515829/">http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596515829/</a><span> since they gave me a free copy?</span><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:01:48] &lt;gemineye&gt; Is there a way to get Zenoss to report up/down status not based on pings but instead on SNMP queries? We have high network traffic that clogs access to our switches and the ICMP ping packets drop. I've looked through the forums but can't find any help there,<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:02:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; etank: looks like you're the first review of the Python book I just recommended<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:03:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; gemineye: you could just disable ping monitoring in zProperties, then if you get an SNMP Agent Down alert, there's a good chance the device is down<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:04:45] &lt;gemineye&gt; But those types of alerts aren't considered in the uptime metrics, also when a system is considered down, other services that go down aren't alerted on.<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:06:26] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: thanks, I'll get it <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:06:57] &lt;gemineye&gt; Our network team is telling me they won't use Zenoss to monitor their switches because of this. They've gotten tired of all the ping failures that occur because the ICMP packets are dropped by the switches due to bandwidth constraints.<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:07:21] &lt;hackeron&gt; hmmm, so I don't get it, why does zenoss use 800MB of ram monitoring 2 devices? - I mean requesting snmp data takes what, 500KB of ram? -- pretty big leap from 500KB to 800MB...<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:09:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; hackeron: it is running the Zope framework, plus 14 daemons, plus a MySQL database, and the whole Zenoss/Zope systems are based on python, which needs an interpreter to execute the code, so it's fairly memory intensive<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:10:19] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: I'm excluding the mysql database here - also, why does each of the daemons have to take up to 90MB of ram??<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:10:29] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: what's it doing with all that ram?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:10:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss caches a heck of a lot of stuff to improve performance<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:11:06] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: like what?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:11:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd have to go through the code to give you specifics, I know that it caches ZenPack info for instance<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:11:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; It caches RRD values<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:11:37] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: 800MB -- ok, caching zope (hmm, why?) - 20MB -- where's the 780MB gone? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:12:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; like I said, it's a wackload of python scripts, python is not as efficients, as say something like C<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:12:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; either way, I don't see what the big deal is, most people have 2 to 4GB of RAM in their workstations these days, let alone their servers<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:12:58] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: it's not a python issue, I have python processes running 20 threads each collecting a hell of a lot of data and writing to database taking 20MB of ram<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:13:15] &lt;rocket&gt; hackeron: it consumes more ram because the enterprise equivalent uses alot of network and daemon tools etc<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:13:27] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: not on a VPS and I'd rather use that memory to cache my large database<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:13:28] &lt;rocket&gt; hackeron: eg it is built to be distributed<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:13:47] &lt;hackeron&gt; rocket: I still dont understand where all that ram is going...<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:13:53] &lt;rocket&gt; hackeron: zope....<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:14:17] &lt;hackeron&gt; time to migrate to django maybe <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:14:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; zope uses an object database to store everything in the UI minus perf data and events<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:14:24] &lt;rocket&gt; hackeron: basically each daemon loads quite a bit of zope more than one time ..<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:14:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm monitoring over 350 devices on one Zenoss box, and I have a ton of custom command based scripts being executed by Zenoss for various tasks, I'm pulling in at just under 2GB usage<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:15:25] &lt;rocket&gt; hackeron: I am not saying that there arent areas that could be redone however <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:15:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; hackeron: yeh, agreed that it's not as efficient as it could be, but it's honestly not bad<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:15:52] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: Im not familiar with zope, but sounds like what django does, it has ORM - except it takes almost no ram <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:16:32] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: heh, zenoss is fantastic but this ram use is just scarming me<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:17:00] &lt;rocket&gt; hackeron: flexibility comes at a cost ..<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:17:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; trust me, nobody is crazy about Zope around here, but we use it for almost everything (UI, object DB, permissions, hierarchies)<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:17:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and not much effort has been put into reducing our memory footprint<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:17:44] &lt;hackeron&gt;

ok, good point <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:18:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; they'd have to redesign the whole system to use django, which would be ridiculous lol<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:18:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's been discussed by dev to switch to something else<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:18:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zope has some nice stuff, like the LDAP Authentication plugins<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:18:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; right now we're getting off of ancient versions of Zope and Python, then we'll start seeing what our options are<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:19:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; django would need to support LDAP (if it doesn't already)<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:19:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; King Crab will have Zope 2.11.2<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:19:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Stone Crab will have Zope 2.12 and Python 2.6 in theory<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:19:29] &lt;cgibbons&gt; xfingers<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:19:43] &lt;rmatte&gt;

hackeron: I am sure you could ask anyone in here if zenoss could do things better and they would say yes .. but compared to what else is out there it does fit a specific need ..<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:22:16] &lt;hackeron&gt; haha, it just gave me an error about my swap space being low -- guess it's still munching ram<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:22:54] &lt;hackeron&gt; rocket: oh absolutely, no way I would have nagios going and monitoring just about everything within what, 30 minutes<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:24:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; hackeron: it starts off at a certain amount of ram and keeps munching for a while up until a point<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:25:19] &lt;gemineye&gt; Does anyone use sendpage with Zenoss?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:25:23] &lt;rmatte&gt;

hmmm<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:27:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; hackeron: you can't even work out 300 bucks to put together a workstation with 2GB of RAM in it?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:27:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:28:30] &lt;hackeron&gt;

rmatte: problem isn't the hardware, is the internet connection - so I either get a rack and put my own hardware which is way out of price range or get a VPS <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:30:17] * etank loves getting free books (t-shirts too)<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:33:16] &lt;rmatte&gt;

followed by the IO<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:35:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; less processing power just means the monitoring cycles take a bit longer<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:35:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and yeh, the IO<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:36:01] &lt;hackeron&gt;

their Linux VPS looks promising<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:37:33] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: what's the advantage of paying $50 per month when I can have 1gb of ram for $16 per month?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:37:40] &lt;hackeron&gt;

unless you want to use nagios and spend forever setting it up to be super lightweight<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:39:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd imagine you'd be pulling in more than $50 each month for the monitoring services, no?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:40:03] &lt;hackeron&gt;

rmatte: so thinking of having both monitoring with zenoss and set up the openvpn to give people access even if the DVR is behind a NAT<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:43:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; oooh, I like the drag and drop feature<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:43:02] &lt;hackeron&gt;

pretty cool system<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:44:27] &lt;hackeron&gt; yeah, so I don't get why that works on 128mb of ram with 8 h264 encoding processes<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:44:31] &lt;hackeron&gt; and zenoss needs 2gb, lol<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:44:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; the answer is: Zope<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:44:50] &lt;hackeron&gt; heh, fair enough<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:44:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; 'tis a beast<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:44:54] &lt;hackeron&gt; yeah, I use django there <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:45:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; the response times are quite good<br/><span> [16-Jul-2009 14:45:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hackeron: these guys use zenoss with zlinks from devices to the camera images: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.mts-iss.com/blog/">http://www.mts-iss.com/blog/</a><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:45:55] &lt;hackeron&gt; mrayzenoss: very cool!<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:46:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, found a bit of a bug<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:46:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I dragged one of the cameras out of the frame and it just vanished<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:46:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you could probably embed your DVR images into zlinks to show current images on the status pages<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:46:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; now I can't get it back<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:46:31] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: hmm?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:47:04] &lt;hackeron&gt; can you tell me how to reproduce?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:47:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; like, I dragged a camera in to a frame in the layout, then dragged it out a ways and let go, and it vanished<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:47:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; then the item to drag and drop on the left was greyed out<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:47:32] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: can't seem to reproduce<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:47:38] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: it is grayed out when you drop it in a layout<br/><span> [16-Jul-2009 14:48:18] &lt;hackeron&gt; btw: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://hackeron.dyndns.org:82/cctv/videos/168853">http://hackeron.dyndns.org:82/cctv/videos/168853</a><span> </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:48:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; BBIAB<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:48:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, when I drop it in it goes grayed out on the left, but once it's dropped in, I drag it out a ways and it vanishes from the layout, I also can't select it again to drag it in<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:48:55] &lt;hackeron&gt; but this is a debug version, so video is a bit choppy<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:49:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; did it create that video automatically?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:49:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; even has sound, neat<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:50:03] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: yes, it created the video automatically -- it has a pretty substantial post capture (anything from 5 seconds to 300 minutes) -- but if there is no repeat motion after the postcapture (in this case 2 minutes), it deletes the 2 minutes<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:50:25] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: so you get a nice short little event video you can download and email <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:50:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; very cool<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:50:57] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: and for contineous motion, or motion where a person steps out of sight of the camera for a few minutes, you still don't lose the video in between (say person is talking on the phone)<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:51:13] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: plus you have timelapse anyway <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:51:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:52:18] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: yeah, so point is only thing here that takes ram is the precapture (uncompressed video) and encoder processes for motion estimation - the python bits take maybe 10MB of ram altogether<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:52:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; you have a cat or something out back?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:52:42] &lt;hackeron&gt; rmatte: heh, probably - he's ill at the moment, should really be indoors<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:53:35] &lt;hackeron&gt; where'd you see him?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:53:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I saw a white cat, then there was a black one in your yard a while back<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:53:49] &lt;hackeron&gt; mine's the white one <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:53:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; he was on one of the in-progress recordings<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:54:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; he's gone now<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:54:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; rear door<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:54:47] &lt;hackeron&gt; I'll go look, lol<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:56:52] &lt;hackeron&gt; got him <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:57:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; you know, you might be able to rig it up where you have Zenoss running on a box at home but have the actual collector on the VPS, that might help<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:57:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; just a thought<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:58:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's nice how the system only records events of interest and timestamps them then provides video clips<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:58:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's the ultimate surveillance system<br/> [16-Jul-2009 14:59:03] &lt;hackeron&gt; there are a lot of really neat features on the system <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [16-Jul-2009 14:59:33] &lt;hackeron&gt; some of them are noted here: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://fusetech.co.uk">http://fusetech.co.uk</a><br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:00:05] &lt;hackeron&gt; it's basically the zenoss of physical security and survaillance <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:00:10] &lt;hackeron&gt; (minus the ram use)<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:00:44] &lt;hackeron&gt; but that's the thing, on the dev box I have very little ram to test, but in production I put loads of ram so the entier database is in ram -- I don't want to waste that ram needlessly <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:01:36] &lt;rmatte&gt;

heh, I probably will when I can afford it <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:02:08] &lt;hackeron&gt; at the moment I have a pretty neat product but no clients<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:02:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:02:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; it is pretty neat<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:02:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should go after businesses like restaurants and stuff<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:02:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; is the camera equipment quite expensive?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:03:25] &lt;hackeron&gt; heh, well, what's really nice is highly optimised h264 encoding (thank you #x264!) - but that means putting in core i7 920 minimum to handle 16 analog cameras<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:03:35] &lt;hackeron&gt; and only around 12 ip cameras<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:03:57] &lt;hackeron&gt; so the restaurants can use their existing cameras, but for me to make any kind of profit, the DVR ends up quite expensive<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:04:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:04:36] &lt;hackeron&gt; but the compression is quite extreme - we're talking 3 months of contineous video<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:04:50] &lt;hackeron&gt; some installations I did keep a whole year from 8 cameras on 750gb<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:05:02] &lt;rmatte&gt;

it's night time there right now?<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:08:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh right<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:08:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; UK<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:08:52] &lt;hackeron&gt; it's 9pm<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:08:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, you still have sunlight, I guess the cameras on that other demo are located inside and the lights are turned off<br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:09:06] &lt;hackeron&gt; well, it just got darker <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [16-Jul-2009 15:09:12] &lt;hackeron&gt;

Let me check<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:14:47] &lt;straterra&gt; I installed just the core ones<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:15:07] &lt;straterra&gt; Core ones plus a wmi one<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:15:26] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Is it its own snmp server?<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:17:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's why I had to do create scripts to collect the performance data from the standard microsoft SNMP agent<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:18:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's an add-on to the local snmp server I believe, but I'm not sure<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:18:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; never used it<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:18:33] &lt;straterra&gt; Oh..but..I install that and I should get performance graphs?<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:18:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:18:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; the OIDs it's trying to poll are snmp-informant specific<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:18:58] &lt;straterra&gt; Oh, gotcha<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:19:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; we work off the values from the default windows SNMP agent, but our solution isn't pretty, it works though<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:20:46] &lt;straterra&gt; I hope its in MSI format..It'd be easy to push to the servers<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:20:57] &lt;straterra&gt; aaaaand it isnt<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:20:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; the planning for the microsoft SNMP agent was garbage, the OID for RAM changes dynamically based on how many physical drives are in the system, so it's different from server to server, then the CPU OIDs tend to wander, so they aren't always the same<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:21:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I've had to create scripts to hunt down the OID on each server and then collect the data from it<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:24:30] &lt;straterra&gt; That's lame<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:24:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; very<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:25:04] &lt;straterra&gt; I notice you can configure 'paging', as opposed to email<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:25:10] &lt;straterra&gt; Does that require some kind of physical modem?<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:25:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:25:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:25:35] &lt;straterra&gt; Right now, we send emails to the cell providors sms gateway<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:25:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think you need to send it to the email address that corresponds with the pager<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:25:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it just changes the way it formats the messages when they are sent<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:26:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; makes it briefer to better suit mobile devices I believe<br/> [17-Jul-2009 15:26:09] &lt;straterra&gt;

I hope zenoss is confed to use it... what's the default credentials, so I can try myself?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 09:56:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; int: not really possible to push it, Zenoss needs to execute the script, I suppose you could have scripts actively running pushing to file(s) and then have Zenoss executing a script that scrapes the file(s) for data<br/> [21-Jul-2009 09:57:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; Diddi: was MySQL installed already when you installed Zenoss?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 09:57:06] &lt;Diddi&gt; nope<br/> [21-Jul-2009 09:57:36] &lt;Diddi&gt; fresh install with debian, had nothing from the beginning... I've only installed zenoss-stack with apt-get<br/> [21-Jul-2009 09:57:44] &lt;Diddi&gt; and all dependencies is included there<br/> [21-Jul-2009 09:57:53] &lt;int&gt; rmatte: yep, but then you will hit issues with locks etc, that's what i like to avoid<br/> [21-Jul-2009 09:58:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; int: not necessarily, it's like performing a tail -f on a log file that's being actively written to<br/> [21-Jul-2009 09:58:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; Diddi: hmmm<br/> [21-Jul-2009 09:59:37] &lt;Diddi&gt; had the same problem when I tried from source on another computer... where I definitly know the database-connection was working properly<br/> [21-Jul-2009 09:59:42] &lt;Diddi&gt; no errors in any logs<br/> [21-Jul-2009 09:59:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; Diddi: I'm trying to remember where the MySQL config is stored<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:02:53] &lt;straterra&gt; Is it easy to move an install of zenoss?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:03:06] &lt;straterra&gt; I have it configured in a virtual machine right now..and I'm going to be moving it to a 'real' machine<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:04:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, 3307 is the default<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:05:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you able to connect to mysql on that port?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:05:45] &lt;Diddi&gt; yeah<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:06:03] &lt;Diddi&gt; altough I don't have any user/pass, but netcat still approves<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:06:05] &lt;Diddi&gt; (:<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:06:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; then it's probably an authentication issue<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:06:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you set a username and pass on install or just take the defaults?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:06:54] &lt;Diddi&gt; the apt-get install is quite non-interactive<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:07:07] &lt;Diddi&gt; so I'd bet defaults <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:07:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, do: mysql -u zenoss -p<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:07:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; then type in zenoss<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:07:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; see if you get a prompt<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:09:19] &lt;Diddi&gt; that works fine<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:09:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, super weird then, how did you start zenoss?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:09:47] &lt;Diddi&gt;&#160; /etc/init.d/zenoss-stack start<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:09:54] &lt;twm1010&gt; but if you installed from stack, it runs its own MySQL<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:09:59] &lt;Diddi&gt; indeed<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:10:02] &lt;Diddi&gt; and that I do<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:10:07] &lt;twm1010&gt; probably with it's own usernames and passwords, preset.<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:10:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; become root, then do: su - zenoss<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:10:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; then type "zenoss stop"<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:10:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; then type "zenoss start"<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:10:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; and check it again<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:10:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; it would probably be zenoss-stack stop/start<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:10:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: they both work<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:10:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; ah, as zenoss user right..<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:11:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: the zenoss-stack is just a startup script<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:11:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yeh, as zenoss user<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:11:15] &lt;twm1010&gt; does the zenoss command as zenoss user start and stop the built-in sql instance tho?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:11:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; i don't think so, that threw me off building my SUSE install<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:11:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yes, it does<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:11:43] &lt;Diddi&gt; same error<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:12:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: actually hmmm, it doesn't lol, I never noticed that before<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:12:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; as root, try service zenoss-stack stop/start<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:12:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; or, just restart would probably do it<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:13:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just do stop to make sure everything has a proper chance to exit<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:13:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; the restart it quite quick<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:13:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; is*<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:13:44] &lt;Diddi&gt; twm1010: service doesn't exist..<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:13:53] &lt;Diddi&gt; command that is<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:14:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; Diddi: nah, /etc/init.d/zenoss-stack restart<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:14:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; service is something redhat specific I assume?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:14:24] &lt;Diddi&gt; yeah I think so<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:14:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; redhat/centos/suse specific<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:15:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's why I'm not a fan of any of those distros, they set they don't follow many standards<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:15:35] &lt;Diddi&gt; I'm only running debian to get zenoss working<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:15:47] &lt;Diddi&gt; but that didn't help <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:15:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm running Zenoss on Ubuntu Server and it works fine<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:16:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; Ubuntu Server 8.04, and I did the install from the stack installer manually<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:17:04] &lt;Diddi&gt; but it should work with debian <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:17:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, it should work fine with Debian<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:17:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; it sounds like you're cursed or something<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:17:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:17:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; hold on, I'm trying to find where Zenoss stores it's MySQL config<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:18:32] &lt;Diddi&gt; take your time (: i'm on my second week trying to get this working<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:18:37] &lt;Diddi&gt; hehe<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:18:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's crazy<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:18:49] &lt;Diddi&gt; indeed<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:18:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; we didn't have any problems installing it at first, just took a while to figure out some stuff<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:19:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; like compiling Cisco Mibs<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:19:13] &lt;Diddi&gt; student.. no time... eager to get it working from source... <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:19:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:19:21] &lt;Diddi&gt; no time == too much time<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:21:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; if one of the devs or engineers were around here they'd know this right away, I've just never had to reconfig MySQL on my Zenoss installs<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:23:00] &lt;Diddi&gt; hehe<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:35:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I can't find it, it must be stored in Zope somewhere<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:36:46] &lt;Diddi&gt; hmm<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:47:37] &lt;sto6ma9ch&gt; Hello.<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:47:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; great, I've got a device that I can snmpwalk perfectly fine, and that I've verified that Zenoss has the right settings for, but it's throwing SNMP agent down notifications for it<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:47:57] &lt;sto6ma9ch&gt; I have one server reporting negative disk space.<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:48:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; sto6ma9ch: remodel the device<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:51:30] &lt;sto6ma9ch&gt; Done. I'll see if that takes care of it after a cycle.<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:51:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; sto6ma9ch: something probably changed on the server and Zenoss didn't remodel to pick up on it. Either that, or the initial modelling didn't work properly<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:52:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; 99% of the time that's the issue when it comes to drive space being reported incorrectly<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:52:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; you may need to delete the RRD file and have Zenoss regenerate it as well<br/> [21-Jul-2009 10:52:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; but just leave it at a remodel for now<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:13:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; hey Matt, any idea what would cause Zenoss to generate SNMP agent down notifications for a device after changing the community string and renaming the device from the IP address to the name of the device?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:13:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've tried remodelling, pushing changes, doing a reindex, nothing is working<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:14:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; the device is fully snmpwalkable<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:15:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it was working fine before, all we did was change the string on the device, updated it in Zenoss, and renamed the device<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:15:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; if you move the event to history does it come back?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:16:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: yeh, it does<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:16:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've seen people in here with this type of issue before, just haven't had it actually happen to us before<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:17:10] &lt;kisielk&gt; my zenprocess keeps dying <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:17:32] &lt;kisielk&gt; even though the state is reported as green<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:17:43] &lt;kisielk&gt;

well, i don't have the fastest box, so...<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:31:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; omg, I think that SNMP problem just resolved itself<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:31:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; i'm currently trying to iron out all the devices not responding to SNMP quickly..<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:31:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; or something I did resolved it finally<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:32:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; also... having an odd issue with two sever on the same segment as my zenoss box<br/> [21-Jul-2009 11:32:24] &lt;rmatte&gt;

they must have removed it for everything other than command based datapoints<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:21:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; it used to always be visible before, weird<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:21:06] &lt;rmatte&gt;

hey, does anyone know how Zenoss applies the template inheritance (is it just at device creation, or does it eventually trickle down)<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:22:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; jmp242: If a device is in a group that a template is bound to then all sub-objects of that group have the template applied to them<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:22:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; none that i can see<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:23:34] &lt;jmp242&gt; hmmm - I take it this doesn't take effect if you apply it to /Devices though<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:23:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; jmp242: If I move a device from /Network/Cisco to /Server/Windows all Windows templates, plugins, etc... get applied to that device, and the Cisco stuff gets removed<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:23:47] &lt;jmp242&gt; (or it doesn't seem to in my testing)<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:24:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; jmp242: yeh, a template applied to /Devices should trickle down, unless a specific group already has a locally applied template with the same name<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:24:37] &lt;jmp242&gt; mmm - so if I'm using the b_fping template as a local copy on my test device (single device)<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:24:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; jmp242: there are inherited templates, and local templates<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:25:01] &lt;jmp242&gt; it could prevent the b_fping applied from the original template at /Devices from working<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:25:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; No, it shouldn't prevent it.<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:25:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; jmp242: you can't have both, it's either local or inherited, not a mixture of the two<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:25:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; But just because you put it at /Devices, doesn't necessarily mean it binds it all the way down.<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:25:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you need to play with the binding at each level until it works properly<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:26:07] &lt;jmp242&gt; Hmmm<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:26:08] &lt;jmp242&gt; ok...<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:26:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: I'm going to try and just add another datasource with the same OID, but a different name<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:28:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; the template doesn't HAVE to be in the same device class right? I placed the template at /Dev/Power/UPS and then bound it at ../UPS/Tripplite, that shouldn't matter should it?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:29:53] &lt;jmp242&gt; I see, for some reason it worked everywhere except my second test location /Devices/Server/Linux<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:29:57] &lt;jmp242&gt; ... that's life<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:29:59] &lt;jmp242&gt; now it's working<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:30:17] &lt;twm1010&gt; It could be that the collector hadn't picked up the changes yet.<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:33:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; man.. no dice :|<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:37:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: no, that should work<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:38:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: no debug messages?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:38:18] &lt;twm1010&gt; nope, no debug msgs<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:38:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; could it be the names I gave my datasources?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:38:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; the _ throwing things off?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:38:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; ah, but i just created another simply called inputvoltage, no dice<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:39:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should show up as inputvoltage_inputvoltage when you put it in the graph<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:39:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; indeed, thats what it shows as missing, the RRD files simply aren't there<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:39:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; it also takes 3 polling cycles before it starts graphing<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:40:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; i wonder if... these devices are snmpv1 only?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:40:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure if it takes 3 polling cycles before it actually creates the RRD, but I'd imagine it would create it on the first cycle<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:40:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; in the past it's taken 5-10 mins at most<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:40:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt it, your test wouldn't have worked if that was the case<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:40:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; its been 24 hours<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:40:35] &lt;rmatte&gt;

twm1010: yeh, most devices support v2 these days<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:42:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: that's actually discouraged, the old .zip ZenPacks used to do that<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:42:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; but you can link to the scripts in the ZenPack directory<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:42:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: so how do you do it now then?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:42:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 1 sec<br/> [21-Jul-2009 13:42:39] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I've not seen that - do you mean using something like epilog<br/> [21-Jul-2009 14:53:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, if you setup the windows servers to trap back to your Zenoss box it'll send certain event log messages (any critical messages) as traps<br/> [21-Jul-2009 14:53:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to install WINDOWS-NT-PERFORMANCE.mib<br/> [21-Jul-2009 14:54:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; then the traps will come in looking like snmp trap enterprises.8.4.23.45.3<br/> [21-Jul-2009 14:54:14] &lt;jmp242&gt; oh - I didn't actually know that.

zSnmpCommunities is usually only set at /Devices, and is used during Discovery, if I am correct<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:50:10] &lt;blocky&gt; where do i correct that, in the device template?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:50:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's your problem then<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:50:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; change the string in /Devices<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:50:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; in the templates section of the root of /Devices<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:50:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; erm, zProperties section<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:50:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; rather<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:50:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; (sorry, I'm working with templates right now hehe)<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:50:54] &lt;blocky&gt; np<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:51:23] &lt;blocky&gt; im trying the modeller again<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:51:26] &lt;blocky&gt; should i push changes first<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:51:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:52:23] &lt;blocky&gt; snmpwalk worked from the menu<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:52:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; good sign<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:52:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; try a model<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:52:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; pastebin the model output too so we can see it<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:53:36] &lt;blocky&gt; there's a few metrics, ram and swap etc, which were blocked due to zFileSystemMapIgnoreTypes<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:53:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's normal<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:54:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; pastebin the output, I'm more interested in other possible messages<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:54:20] &lt;blocky&gt; okay hold on<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:54:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/><span> [21-Jul-2009 15:55:58] &lt;blocky&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/d164d796d">http://pastebin.com/d164d796d</a><br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:56:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; checking...<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:57:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that looks good<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:58:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; the performance info should populate now at some point<br/> [21-Jul-2009 15:58:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; "Changes in configuration applied" is a good sign, because it indicates that it picked up more info than the last time you modeled<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:01:24] &lt;blocky&gt; so far i noticed the filesystem info populated where it wasnt befoer<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:01:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's a good sign<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:01:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; check the perf tab, you should see all graphs<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:01:44] &lt;blocky&gt; ill give it a few more minutes and see if the rrds/graphs get created<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:01:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; they may have "nan" values<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:01:52] &lt;blocky&gt; not yet<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:02:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, it needs to hit a polling cycle first, so give it a bit of time<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:02:26] &lt;blocky&gt; ok cool<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:02:37] &lt;blocky&gt; once i get this working i need to figure out how HP's snmp agent works<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:03:01] &lt;grumpie&gt; can the Availability Report report on specific times of the day, rather than just whole days?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:06:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; grumpie: it's availability between the dates specified, but there's no way to break it down by day<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:06:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; or by parts of days rather<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:07:37] &lt;blocky&gt; still no graphs here rmatte<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:07:42] &lt;grumpie&gt; ok. thanks<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:07:49] &lt;blocky&gt; load average is appearing with the rrds missing<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:07:53] &lt;blocky&gt; but its the only one<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:08:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; blocky: push changes to the collector, also, check to make sure the RRD files are actually still missing<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:09:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; $ZENHOME/perf<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:10:06] &lt;blocky&gt; there's no folder at all for that device<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:11:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; that could be an issue<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:12:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: any idea what would keep a performance folder from being created for a device?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:12:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; blocky: was it under a different name initially?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:12:39] &lt;blocky&gt; well not exactly<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:12:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; blocky: is this a new Zenoss install (if so, how did you install it?)<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:13:07] &lt;blocky&gt; i had the same device modelled previously under a different name but the same ip<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:13:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, and is there a performance folder left over from that device?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:13:31] &lt;blocky&gt; i just deleted the line in /etc/hosts<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:13:44] &lt;blocky&gt; yep<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:13:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; delete that folder<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:13:57] &lt;blocky&gt; done<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:14:04] &lt;blocky&gt; remodel?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:14:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; now remodel the device<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:14:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; and see if the folder gets created<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:14:49] &lt;blocky&gt; if it looked up the host i was using now to an ip, and then backwards referenced that ip to the first host it was associated with and stopped there<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:15:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; that may be what the issue was<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:15:22] &lt;blocky&gt; no folder was created<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:15:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's no perf folder for the IP as well or anything I assume?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:15:45] &lt;blocky&gt; nope<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:15:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; try removing and re-adding the device<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:16:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure the snmp info is correct when adding it<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:16:11] &lt;blocky&gt; oh lemme delete one other folder as well <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:16:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:16:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; delete that folder, remodel, if that doesn't work you might consider restarting zenoss and trying again<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:16:36] &lt;blocky&gt; i wish zenoss could abstract device names from their host<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:17:24] &lt;blocky&gt; okay im blowing out all the devices that had anything to do with that ip<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:17:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:17:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; there were more than 1?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:17:58] &lt;blocky&gt; okay it just deleted the wrong device :|<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:18:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; yikes<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:18:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; how'd you manage that?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:18:27] &lt;blocky&gt; i checked the box and selected delete from the menu<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:18:58] &lt;blocky&gt; the notification icon in the corner said the one i picked was deleted, but the device list shows it still tehre and another one gone<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:19:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; sounds like you've got something pretty screwed up there<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:19:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you familliar with zendmd?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:19:33] &lt;blocky&gt; ive tried to play with it a bit<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:19:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, go in to it<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:19:38] &lt;blocky&gt; far from familiar<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:19:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; type: reindex()<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:19:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; then: commit()<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:19:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; and exit<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:19:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; it sounds like your zope db is out of wack<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:20:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; reindexing it will probably solve the problem<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:20:25] &lt;blocky&gt; okay<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:20:34] &lt;blocky&gt; i have been messing with it a fair bit<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:20:45] &lt;blocky&gt; i spent some time trying to get a sort of hybrid report that shows graphs and tables<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:20:54] &lt;blocky&gt; i reindexed<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:20:57] &lt;blocky&gt; now restart zenoss?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:21:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; you reindexed, and commited right?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:21:21] &lt;blocky&gt; yes sir<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:21:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, yeh, restart zenoss now<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:21:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; then re-add whatever device got deleted<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:21:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then try to delete the one you tried to remove in the first place<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:21:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; or actually, try to delete that one before adding the other one<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:22:59] &lt;blocky&gt; ive got another of these bandaids in place with 3 devices redirecting to the same ip<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:23:03] &lt;blocky&gt; but its an entirely separate ip<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:23:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:23:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; bandaids like that are bad news with Zenoss<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:24:12] &lt;blocky&gt; okay it deleted properly that time<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:24:26] &lt;blocky&gt; im gonna try to readd my device<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:24:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:24:53] &lt;blocky&gt; why doesn't it appear in the device list right away<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:25:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:25:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:25:17] &lt;blocky&gt; not yet<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:25:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, let it run through<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:26:33] &lt;blocky&gt; okay the graphs look the same as before<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:26:37] &lt;blocky&gt; do i have to run the modeller manually?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:26:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, do you see the hard drive info?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:27:02] &lt;blocky&gt; yea<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:27:18] &lt;blocky&gt; still no perf folder<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:27:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm stumped then<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:27:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd need to talk to someone like cluther for this one<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:27:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never seen anything like that before<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:28:33] &lt;blocky&gt; how do i blow out mysql<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:28:39] &lt;blocky&gt; ill reinstall zenoss<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:29:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you install using stack installer?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:30:06] &lt;blocky&gt; im not sure<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:30:17] &lt;blocky&gt; yes<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:30:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; was it a .bin file that you executed?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:30:24] &lt;blocky&gt; yea i did<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:30:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so you want to completely uninstall Zenoss?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:30:36] &lt;blocky&gt; 2.4.1<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:30:46] &lt;blocky&gt; yea<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:30:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; execute /usr/local/zenoss/uninstall<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:31:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; that'll wipe out all the devices and everything though<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:31:27] &lt;blocky&gt; thats fine<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:31:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you might as well download and install 2.4.2 now<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:31:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; just to save an upgrade later<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:31:43] &lt;blocky&gt; im a noob to sql<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:31:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss only stores events in sql<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:32:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; it uses Zope for everything else<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:32:06] &lt;blocky&gt; k<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:32:16] &lt;blocky&gt; does the uninstaller remove those events?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:32:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:32:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; it removes MySQL<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:32:48] &lt;blocky&gt; is the tar.gz a zipped up bin<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:32:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:33:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; the .tar.gz is source<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:33:04] &lt;blocky&gt; oh<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:33:06] &lt;blocky&gt; screw that<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:33:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure you get the .bin<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:33:30] &lt;blocky&gt; trying to find one on google<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:33:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; what Linux are you running?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:33:50] &lt;blocky&gt; centos 5<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:33:56] &lt;blocky&gt; get it<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:33:59] &lt;blocky&gt;

pretty sure<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:34:18] &lt;blocky&gt; what if i did though<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:34:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'd put the files in a different spot<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:34:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you have /usr/local/zenoss/zenoss then you used the bin installer<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:35:09] &lt;blocky&gt; is this not correct syntax: find / -name *zenoss*<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:35:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; "*zenoss*"<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:35:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need the quotes when using the wildcards<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:35:48] &lt;blocky&gt; k cool<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:35:51] &lt;blocky&gt; yea im sure it was the bin<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:35:59] &lt;blocky&gt; 16 mins left on the new version<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:36:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can also just do "updatedb" then "locate zenoss"<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:36:12] &lt;blocky&gt; how late will you be on today?<br/> [21-Jul-2009 16:36:21] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I think the incoming beat takes a bit of time to be noticed by the heartbeat monitor, and it was failing again before it cleared. Now that I increased it to 300 it seems to be behaving properly. Now how do I get it to fail red instead of orange. Up the severity on the beat event?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 09:38:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; Anyone have any insight to the following error?

It's not possible to auto-clear above error, so the Critical events never get cleared<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:00:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; don't know the history of that, wonder if that's intentional<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:00:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; possibly, but seems like the user should be able to do it if they wish to<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:00:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; agreed<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:01:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; in our case, we have it sending events to our ticketing system, so no one actually goes in to Zenoss to acknowledge or clear events, so we have it set to auto-clear them every hour<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:01:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; by "clear" I mean move to history<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:01:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well that's a shame, you won't get the full glory of the new Event Console <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:02:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I still use the event console for tuning, but the analysts just use the ticketing system, easier to work with, plus it allows us to run multiple instances of Zenoss and have all the events displayed in one spot<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:02:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; and we can sort alerts out by queue if need be<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:03:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; where we're lacking right now is in the reporting aspect, which is something we're working on<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:04:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, reporting just missed the cut for King Crab, it's a known weakness<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:04:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the upgrade didn't trash my ldap settings, that's good news<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:05:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'd be nice to see a better gui based report designer<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:05:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; where you can pick common components, such as intefaces, disk, etc... and build reports then apply filters or whatever and save the report<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:05:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that would be nice <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:06:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; By the way, when I get the message that the google maps API is not valid, the map loads anyways, so how necessary is that actual key?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:06:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that seems odd<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:06:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; do you have an API key in there?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:06:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never had the map not load from a bad key<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:06:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, there's a key in there<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:07:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; it just complains that it's not valid (since I'm accessing the box using a different IP/hostname than it is on the prod version of the image)<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:07:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; but the map loads anyways<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:07:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; perhaps the API key was made by IP and it changed?&#160; Or by hostname and the IP changed?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:07:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yup<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:07:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's probably it<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:07:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; but the fact that it still works means you could potentially just use 1 key, and just find a way to eliminate that error message<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:07:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; minor annoyance, I don't know if there's a fix<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:07:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; provided it works regardless<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:08:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; possibly, I don't know<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:08:19] Hunner_ is now known as Hunner<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:08:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; maybe they figure the annoyance is enough<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:08:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; does the enterprise version just generate keys on the fly?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:08:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm not sure, I think they provide the API key for you<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:09:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:09:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I really don't have any exposure to that part<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:09:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; alright hehe, just curious<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:09:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; ummm weird<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:10:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh wait, nevermind, it worked<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:10:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was looking at "Available Zenoss Version" which still says 2.3.3<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:10:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; but the upgrade worked, very smoothly<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:11:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; is it firewalled?&#160; that's weird.&#160; Mine says 2.4.2<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:16:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Alright, I'm gonna let bedwards off the hook and call it a session. I'll be around per usual, but thanks to everyone who stopped by<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:19:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's firewalled for incoming, not outgoing<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:19:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I'm surprised that it's not able to go out and see what the latest version is, either way, doesn't matter<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:19:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, not really a big deal<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:20:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; now I need to break my monster zenpacks down in to smaller ones, fun fun<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:21:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have 1 Zenpack that is basically all templates in /Devices, but it changes the snmp community string when installed, which is quite bad, so I need to break it down, then I have another with all transforms which I'm going to leave as a single pack for now<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:24:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; Do you know if the bug with the network map, (where if devices are outside of the screen and you click "Fit to window" it makes all of the lines that are drawn between devices remain at 1 static location) has been reported?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:24:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; doesn't sound familiar<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:24:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; It basically makes it so that the lines stay in 1 spot, you can move devices around but you can't see the links between them properly<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:24:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll do a search to see and log a trac for it if not<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:25:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, it's kind of working, hmmm<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:26:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, it's not as bad as I remember it being in the past<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:26:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, it's actually working properly now<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:31:44] &lt;dberger&gt; is there any reason why an import that works in zendmd will fail in a daemon module's header?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:34:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; dberger: the only thing that I can think of is that the daemon module doesn't have certain variables that zendmd loads<br/><span> [23-Jul-2009 11:34:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; see: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/Members/netdata/use-a-zendmd-script-as-standalone-program/">http://www.zenoss.com/Members/netdata/use-a-zendmd-script-as-standalone-program/</a><br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:35:03] &lt;rmatte&gt;

hmm<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:47:12] &lt;jb&gt; you guys doing any SSH key based stuff?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:47:13] &lt;jb&gt; with zen<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:48:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not personally<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:48:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; snmp is more suited for the type of monitoring we do<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:48:33] &lt;jb&gt; wonder if it is documented anywhere..<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:48:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: the upgrade didn't write over the config files, just FYI<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:48:43] &lt;jb&gt; well us too.. except for aix<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:48:44] &lt;jb&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:48:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:49:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you looked at the AIX zenpack that rocket made?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:49:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's pretty badass<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:49:22] &lt;jb&gt; yeah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:49:25] &lt;jb&gt; but its snmp based<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:49:35] &lt;jb&gt; which is unstable, and a bitch to configure :/<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:49:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I guess you're more worried about the crappy AIX snmp agent crashing?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:49:47] &lt;jb&gt; yep.. and the configuration of it<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:01] &lt;jb&gt; he hopefully might start transforming it to an ssh based pack <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could always install the port of net-snmp for AIX on your boxes<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:02] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; hi 2 all I've a stupid question. how zenoss monitors cpu utilization by default... just I've broken my default template <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:08] &lt;jb&gt; thats what I do now..<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:10] &lt;jb&gt; and it still sucks<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; crashes a lot?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:31] &lt;jb&gt; yeah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; remind me never to use AIX<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:40] &lt;jb&gt; and doesn't provide all of the stuff that you need<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:45] &lt;jb&gt; you have to use both AIX's snmpd and net-snmp<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:50] &lt;jb&gt; and have net-snmp proxy certain oid's to aix's<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:50:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; garbage<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:51:02] &lt;jb&gt; so.. an SSH rocket pack would be the best <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:51:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; pretty sad that AIX is that crappy for snmp<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:52:00] &lt;jb&gt; yeah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:52:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; Microsoft's SNMP agent isn't all that great either<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:52:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; horrible planning for the OIDs<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:52:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've had to write scripts to hunt down OID values for CPU and Memory<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:52:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; since they wander<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:53:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; if they were smart they would have always made physical memory the first value and paging the second, but instead they put them at the bottom, so the OID changed based on the number of physical drives in the system<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:53:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; the CPU OIDs also just tend to wander on their own, one day the first CPU will be .1, the next it's suddenly .2<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:53:57] &lt;blocky&gt; wow<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:54:13] &lt;blocky&gt; that was poor planning eh<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:54:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; So I've made scripts that address that, I'm going to turn them in to a collector plugin at some point<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:54:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; isn't that what informant addresses?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:54:57] &lt;twm1010&gt; piping perfmon counters to OID's for reliable query?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:55:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: correct, but our clients didn't want informant installed on their systems<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:55:18] &lt;twm1010&gt; probably the name, it does sound kinda shady <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:55:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; and possibly the website that looks a thousand years old<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:55:41] &lt;jb&gt; haha yeah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:55:43] &lt;jb&gt; it does<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:56:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I should send them an email with a subject of: "HIRE A WEB DEVELOPER!!! KTHX!!!"<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:57:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: but yeh, once I have the collector plugin built for that sort of thing, then Zenoss will be able to do effective performance monitoring for windows hosts.<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:57:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; my scripts are written in bash though, so I need to figure out how to turn that in to python<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:57:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm still learning python<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:57:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; interesting, so you're going to use the built-in OID's or trying to?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 11:58:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I'm using them right now successfully, but it's with a couple of bash scripts to collect the info, so it's not very efficient<br/><span> [23-Jul-2009 11:59:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; CPU: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m76f1adbc">http://pastebin.com/m76f1adbc</a><br/><span> [23-Jul-2009 11:59:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; Memory: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m50d2fe0d">http://pastebin.com/m50d2fe0d</a><br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:00:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; so you do these scripts as a command datasource?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:00:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:00:20] &lt;twm1010&gt; the ultimate goal to use built-in SNMP, and not WMI, or use informant?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:00:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:01:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; the main downside right now is that if you want to monitor each separate CPU you need to create a template for each number of CPUs<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:01:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; Man, it would be nice if the report you select can come up first to let you select your criteria, instead of running with some kind of default<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:01:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I have /Devices/Server/1 Processor, 2 Processors, 4 Processors, etc...<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:01:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; i've got 1500 interfaces<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:01:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; then I just put the devices in the appropriate group<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:01:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; Ah... I gotcha, makes sense<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:01:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yeh, I hear you, I have a box with well over 3000 interfaces, it takes forever<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:02:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; I think I ran into that with Netware originally, whoever wrote the Netware Zenpack overcame that<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:03:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; overcame the having to make multiple groups thing?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:03:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; or the report thing?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:03:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; Well, overcame having it track usage among the CPU's<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:03:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:03:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; instead of an aggregate value<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:04:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, this method is working quite nicely for the moment<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:04:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm monitoring over 50 windows servers on one Zenoss instance with it, and it works fine<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:09:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually 62 to be exact<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:11:07] &lt;twm1010&gt;

taking nearly 10 minutes at a time<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:21:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; brutal<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:22:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; I suppose it's having to go to each device, list all the interfaces, then pull the RRD information from each because utilization is there<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:23:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's what it's doing<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:23:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; a simpler report, only needing speeds, which is stored in zope already would be lightning fast.<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:23:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:24:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could make a simpler report fairly easily<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:24:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; just need to copy that .rpt file to some other name, then remove the fields you don't want, run the command to load the report, and you're good to go<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:25:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, how does it get added to the GUI I wonder? or does that command do that<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:25:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; the command does it<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:25:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; python $ZENHOME/Products/ZenReports/ReportLoader.py --force<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:29:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: is there a list of the fixes in 2.4.3?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:34:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm trying to determine if it's worth waiting for 2.4.3 or just doing the 2.4.2 upgrades now<br/><span> [23-Jul-2009 12:34:12] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

thanks<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:35:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; our goal is to do a maintenance release every 6-8 weeks, just to roll up fixes<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:35:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:35:59] &lt;twm1010&gt;

heh yea<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:41:17] &lt;twm1010&gt; zope still cranking away... didn't seem to speed much up<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:43:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; i chopped it down a little, but problem some script or process is still pulling utilization data<br/><span> [23-Jul-2009 12:43:11] &lt;twm1010&gt;

it should be interface.py right now, rename it to interfacespeed.py<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:47:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; and change that line in the report to match<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:52:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; I see a .py and a .pyc for each plugin<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:53:02] &lt;twm1010&gt;

nah, he's copying it<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:54:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; so he doesn't need to delete the pyc<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:54:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; interesting, hopefully this does what i need, i waited it out earlier and got my export, took almost 15 minutes :O<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:54:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:57:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, didn't like that...<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:58:11] &lt;twm1010&gt; i think that's enough for today <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:58:19] &lt;rmatte&gt;

once it runs through without complaining then you're ready to go<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:59:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; you also need to restart zenoss to load the plugin in properly<br/> [23-Jul-2009 12:59:25] &lt;rmatte&gt;

ouch, that is an ugly bug<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:03:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:04:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: wizard wasn't in 2.3.x<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:04:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I know, I tried the link on one of them<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:04:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's why we're going to stick with 2.3.3 for the time being<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:04:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:04:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should almost send out a security advisory about that<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:05:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, I think they discussed that when I wasn't around.<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:05:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; behind your back eh? tsk tsk<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:05:36] &lt;twm1010&gt; Where oh where do I set the "from" address for email notifications<br/><span> [23-Jul-2009 13:05:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; right now its prefixing </span><a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:zenossuser_admin@ourdomain.com">zenossuser_admin@ourdomain.com</a><br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:06:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; nevermind...<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:06:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I believe I was in another meeting when we had that defect review, I would've raised a bigger stink probably<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:06:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's right under settings lol<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:06:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; Maybe I need a bigger screen.<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:07:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; There's only one thing worse than having a big security vulnerability in your software, and that's having a security vulnerability but not making it publicly known<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:07:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: 30 inch!!!<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:07:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what I'm eventually buying for my home computer down the line<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:08:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; once I pay off my credit line, which should be close to doomsday at this point <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:08:37] &lt;jb&gt; mrayzenoss: do you know how OS process monitoring works when using SSH?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:08:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I thought the SSH monitoring was primarily for performance monitoring<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:09:27] &lt;jb&gt; hm, so native OS process monitoring is not supported via SSH?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:09:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; I could be wrong, but I don't think so<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:18:45] &lt;blocky&gt; how can i increase polling frequency from 5 minutes to 1<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:18:51] &lt;blocky&gt; do i need to recreate the rrd files<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:21:37] &lt;jmp242&gt; yes<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:22:19] &lt;jmp242&gt; blocky - search the forums, there is a thread on this. Polling more frequently will have performance implications. And you'll have to re-figure all the graph definitions I believe.<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:22:33] &lt;blocky&gt; manually?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:22:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:22:45] &lt;jmp242&gt; yes<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:22:47] &lt;blocky&gt; ugh<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:22:48] &lt;blocky&gt; why?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:23:10] &lt;jmp242&gt; Because RRD generates how it's going to do the graphs when the graph /RRD is created<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:23:16] &lt;jmp242&gt; and Zenoss uses RRDTool for graphing<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:23:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, the RRD file knows the "units" it's using<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:23:34] &lt;jmp242&gt; It's pretty complicated, I'd check out the RRDTool site on scaling the graphs<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:24:20] &lt;blocky&gt; i never understand why some forums have an option to search message text only but not thread title only<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:24:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so I went and asked about the SSH process monitoring, it was working in 2.4.1 and broke in 2.4.2<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:24:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; blocky: yeh, it's pretty dumb<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:24:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it'll be fixed again<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:24:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, is that on the list for 2.4.3 then?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:24:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; not sure yet<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:24:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I know it's been confirmed working in trunk<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:25:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:25:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; well then it's just a matter of applying a fix that's already been made to 2.4.3 before release<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:25:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:25:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, same as that security one<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:25:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we talked about that as well<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:25:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:26:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; when I saw that one I was like "wow"<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:26:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:26:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I got to talk to Mozilla, Joomla and Drupal QA last weekend, they keep all their security tickets private<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:26:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; this one slipped through the cracks<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:26:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:26:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; zenpatch 14181 to fix it<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:27:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; so that patch can be applied to 2.42?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:27:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:27:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2.4.2 rather<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:27:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; k cool<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:27:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; in the ticket, you see the "Backporting r14180 to the 2.4.x branch"<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:27:35] &lt;twm1010&gt; boy am i a goober<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:27:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that's where you want to zenpatch from<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:27:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; the only programming i've done is COBOL, and that was 6 years ago...<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:27:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; still, i should be able to spot a missing close bracket, now shouldn't i<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:28:10] &lt;blocky&gt; lol<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:29:38] &lt;blocky&gt; so if im collecting data 5x as freqently, do i have to scale all my graphs horizontally to compress them<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:30:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; zoom out, basically?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:30:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the step in the RRD graphs is set by the collector interval<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:30:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenoss needs to be stopped to apply the patch I assume?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:30:34] &lt;blocky&gt; zoom out, yea<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:30:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: that would be safest<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:30:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:30:53] &lt;blocky&gt; mrayzenoss: so if i change the collector interval will the rrds get created automatically?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:31:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; alas, no<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:31:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well, it won't update existing ones<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:31:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so yes they'll get created if they don't exist, but it won't retrofit<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:31:47] &lt;blocky&gt; if i delete the rrd files will it recreate them?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:31:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yes<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:31:56] &lt;blocky&gt; i dont have a ton of historical data i need to worry about<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:32:05] &lt;blocky&gt; do i need to modify the graph definitions?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:32:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; if you reduce the step size (by decreasing the time between collections), you'll store fewer days of that precision<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:33:16] &lt;blocky&gt; i dont actually know how many im storing now, what is the default?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:33:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so you'll want to edit the CREATE commands if you still want 50 hours at 5 minutes as opposed to 10 hours at 1 minute<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:33:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; assuming we're talking SNMP, the default is 300 seconds<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:33:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I think for Commands it's 60<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:34:10] &lt;blocky&gt; its snmp<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:34:30] &lt;blocky&gt; if i edit the create command in the Device template will that affect all my performance graphds<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:34:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, so when you change the frequency from 300 to 60, it will go from 50 hours to 10 hours<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:34:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it will affect any that aren't custom<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:35:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so in the Data source you can define custom RRD CREATE commands as well<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:35:35] &lt;blocky&gt; so the net-snmp has 4 graphs<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:36:30] &lt;blocky&gt; the command is about 20 lines<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:37:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's probably just inheriting the default rrd create defined on the collector<br/><span> [23-Jul-2009 13:38:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; look at </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://yourhost:58080/zport/dmd/Monitors/Performance/localhost/editPerformanceConf">http://yourhost:58080/zport/dmd/Monitors/Performance/localhost/editPerformanceConf</a><br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:39:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you have to change your host and port<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:40:40] &lt;blocky&gt; ah cool<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:40:53] &lt;blocky&gt; so unless i change it all the graphs derive from that command?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:40:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yes<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:43:13] &lt;blocky&gt; so do i change all those 600s to 3000<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:44:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, assuming you want to keep the same length of storage at your new collection rate<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:44:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so your files will also be 5X larger<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:44:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and you'll be writing 5X the number of data points, so keep that in mind if IO starts to bog down<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:45:11] &lt;blocky&gt; right now im only monitoring 2 machines<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:45:17] &lt;blocky&gt; so hopefully my zen box can keep up<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:45:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that should be OK <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:46:00] &lt;blocky&gt; so ill save the config options, then delete all the rrd files?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:46:06] &lt;blocky&gt; then remodel perhaps?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:46:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I think you have to restart zenhub, I could be wrong<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:46:50] &lt;blocky&gt; okay ill restart zenoss<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:51:47] &lt;blocky&gt; my graphs are back but they say nan<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:51:54] &lt;blocky&gt; i guess i have to wait for polling<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:51:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; they take a couple minutes to get data<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:52:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; that patch worked nicely<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:52:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think we're still going to hold off for 2.4.3 though<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:53:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; in theory that will be the last release before King Crab<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:53:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, so I think we'll wait for that, then just do all of our boxes at once<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:56:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; King Crab is 2.5?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:56:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, marketing may change the version number but it's the next major release<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:56:53] * mrayzenoss is a fan of year.month<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:57:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; ah, thinking of a jump to 3.0?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:57:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, my guess is it'll still be 2.5<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:57:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; perhaps Stone Crab will be 3.0, since it should be on Python 2.6<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:57:54] &lt;twm1010&gt;

I don't see one that looks for the King Crab milestone<br/> [23-Jul-2009 13:59:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, doesn't appear to be one<br/> [23-Jul-2009 14:00:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's Trac, so you can build custom reports, let me see if I can put together a King Crab one for you<br/> [23-Jul-2009 14:00:35] &lt;rmatte&gt;

It wouldn't be that hard to gather a list of common sysObjectID's and use that to put things where they need to go.<br/> [23-Jul-2009 14:03:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; and make the list editable by the user<br/> [23-Jul-2009 14:03:30] &lt;rmatte&gt;

in the zenpack class<br/> [23-Jul-2009 15:17:26] &lt;dberger&gt; specified packZProperties<br/> [23-Jul-2009 15:17:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/> [23-Jul-2009 15:19:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; apparently you can creat one in zendmd by doing:<br/> [23-Jul-2009 15:19:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ch = devices<br/> [23-Jul-2009 15:19:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ch._setProperty('zTest', 'Test', type='string')<br/> [23-Jul-2009 15:19:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; commit()<br/> [23-Jul-2009 15:19:20] &lt;rmatte&gt;

mrayzenoss: I need a definitive answer on this. How does the SSH monitoring work? Does Zenoss keep an ssh connection open to the server at all times, or does it connect each time it collects data, then disconnects?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:06:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've heard mixed theories on it<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:06:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I will go ask the developer and get the definitive answer<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:06:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; thanks<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:07:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, the ssh account doesn't need to be root or anything obviously, just a regular user with no special perms?<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:08:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; correct<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:09:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:09:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the modeling closes the session, monitoring leaves it open<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:10:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; perfect<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:10:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; the guys here were concerned that it logged in each time, which would flood the access logs<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:10:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so we reuse the connection for each command call<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:10:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:10:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, there was a ticket about stale connections that was closed recently<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:10:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; There would probably be more overhead and lag if you reauthed the session each time<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:11:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeah, I remember seeing that ticket<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:11:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk for a sec<br/><span> [23-Jul-2009 17:14:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; jb: was this useful? </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://forums.zenoss.com/viewtopic.php?p=37026#37026">http://forums.zenoss.com/viewtopic.php?p=37026#37026</a><br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:20:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's a good tip<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:20:53] * rmatte bookmarks<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:22:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I added it to the notes on the wiki for the AIX ZenPack<br/> [23-Jul-2009 17:24:16] &lt;Blehk&gt; In the docs it's stated that to get snmpd communicating with zenoss properly you just have to set the snmpd rocommunity to public in the snmpd.conf, however, I'm still not receiving a positive flag on the zenoss side.

if I go to /Devices and select my interface templates there is no option to add them to a ZenPack<br/> [24-Jul-2009 09:48:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I certainly don't want to add all of /Devices to one<br/> [24-Jul-2009 09:48:55] &lt;rmatte&gt;

well, I'm going to make a device class called /Interfaces and just pack them in there, then move them out when installed<br/> [24-Jul-2009 09:52:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [24-Jul-2009 09:52:22] &lt;rmatte&gt;

well, I guess<br/> [24-Jul-2009 09:53:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's why ZenPacks need to be tested before putting them up for download though<br/> [24-Jul-2009 09:53:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [24-Jul-2009 10:16:47] &lt;dberger&gt;

It works quite well.<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:08:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; What I may do though for a public release is only monitor based on the Total amount of CPU usage and only have 1 group<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:09:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; Do Egor's WMI ZenPacks use a collector plugin, or command based datapoints?<br/><span> [27-Jul-2009 10:10:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: here's an example of using the model to decide which template to bind to: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="trac-zenpacks/browser/zenpacks/ZenPacks.community.HPSIMMonitor/ZenPacks/community/HPSIMMonitor/modeler/plugins/community/snmp/HPDeviceTemplateMap.py">trac-zenpacks/browser/zenpacks/ZenPacks.community.HPSIMMonitor/ZenPacks/community/HPSIMMonitor/modeler/plugins/community/snmp/HPDeviceTemplateMap.py</a><br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:10:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; somewhat dynamic<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:12:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Egor's ZenPack adds WMI as a datasource option and creates a new zenperfwmi daemon that leverages the built-in stuff in Zenoss<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:12:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so performance should be much better than WMI calls via wmic<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:12:50] &lt;cain22&gt; howdy all<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:13:24] &lt;jb&gt; nice<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:13:32] &lt;jb&gt; so its pretty much just like zenwinperf? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:13:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; jb: not exactly<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:14:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; zenwinperf uses the perfmon interface, zenperfwmi uses the WMI interface<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:14:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; but they get to the same data<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:14:33] &lt;jb&gt; yeah<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:14:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that's how it was explained to me, I'm gonna dig into it a bit more<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:15:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; I still need to convert mine to a collector plugin<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:15:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'd make it much more efficient<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:16:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have the basic method on how to collect the data done, and it works perfectly, but it's done in bash scripts right now<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:16:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; Maybe Egor can help me out with it or something, I'll have to discuss it with him next time I see him around<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:20:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm glad to see that he's getting in to the more advanced WMI stuff though<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:30:20] &lt;cain22&gt; anyone receive an error when they if they try to set a winservice to false?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:30:37] &lt;cain22&gt; i get a BadRequest: The property port does not exist<br/> [27-Jul-2009 10:49:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; don't recall if I mentioned these here, but there are 3 new ZenPacks<br/><span> [27-Jul-2009 10:49:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Fedora Linux </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/community/projects/zenpacks/fedora">http://www.zenoss.com/community/projects/zenpacks/fedora</a><br/><span> [27-Jul-2009 10:49:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; MGE UPS: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/community/projects/zenpacks/mge-ups">http://www.zenoss.com/community/projects/zenpacks/mge-ups</a><br/><span> [27-Jul-2009 10:50:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Ubuntu Linux: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/community/projects/zenpacks/ubuntu">http://www.zenoss.com/community/projects/zenpacks/ubuntu</a><br/> [27-Jul-2009 11:16:11] &lt;ckrough&gt; How do you guys do most of your REST calls in-house? urllib2 or xmlrpc?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 11:19:11] &lt;daleamon&gt; Seems more lively today... can anyone tell me why the network map would not show the 57 workstations etc found by discovery?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 11:20:02] &lt;jb&gt; were their routing tables disovered properly?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 11:28:33] &lt;sacpinball&gt; mrayzenoss i got a quick question for you, which device class should i put an IBM BladeCenter Chasis under?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 11:30:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hmmm... you could add a new organizer<br/> [27-Jul-2009 11:30:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; perhaps /Devices/Hardware?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 11:31:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or /Devices/Rack?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 11:31:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; surprised I haven't been asked that before... good question<br/> [27-Jul-2009 11:35:49] &lt;daleamon&gt; jb: no idea.

does that mean the system was rebooted?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 12:56:56] &lt;jb&gt; logs rotated?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:00:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I think that means it rebooted<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:00:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh no wait, that is log rotation<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:01:02] &lt;ckrough&gt; it would mean that syslogd restarted, which could have been done by logrotate<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:01:06] &lt;jb&gt; right.<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:01:11] &lt;ckrough&gt; whats the 'uptime'<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:09:28] &lt;konfoo&gt; does zenoss use the /ping command rule to ping hosts, or is it referenced somewhere else?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:09:50] &lt;konfoo&gt; i need to 'ping' via some other mechanism since i have icmp blocked on all production hosts<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:09:57] &lt;konfoo&gt; i.e. snmpwalk -v2c -cpublic ${device/manageIp} .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:10:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; it uses a daemon (zenping)<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:10:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yes, Zenoss uses ping to determine whether or not a device is reachable<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:10:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so the other daemons will check with zenping to determine if something is available<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:11:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you'll have to tweak the alerts of SNMP down to get the same effect<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:11:56] &lt;konfoo&gt; so do i have to go in and edit the zenping command code, or is it configurable via the etc/zenping.conf file somehow?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:13:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; what do you want to do exactly?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:13:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can turn off pinging with the zProperty<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:13:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, setup a transform for "SNMP Agent Down" that says something like "ip &lt;bleh&gt; is down" instead, then you need to go in to zProperties and disable ping monitoring in zProperties (zPingMonitorIgnore)<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:13:41] &lt;konfoo&gt; ah ok<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:13:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; zPingMonitorIgnore = True<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:13:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; or you can just assume that "SNMP Agent Down" == Device is down, and just not do a transform<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:13:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; really up to you<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:14:36] &lt;konfoo&gt; nod<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:14:39] &lt;konfoo&gt; thanks for the help<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:14:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, the only difference is if you're using multiple collectors to monitor something, you'll get multiple alerts<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:15:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; instead of the big "Device is unreachable" from ZenPing which suppresses the other events<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:15:51] &lt;konfoo&gt; i guess i could always block icmp on the border and enable it on the production boxes<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:16:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; that'd probably be the best way of doing things<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:16:10] &lt;konfoo&gt; just trying to figure out if zenoss would run more efficiently with it enabled<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:16:16] &lt;konfoo&gt; and that seems to be what youre inferring<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:16:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it would<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:16:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, ping is used to track if devices are available or not<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:16:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; but there are work-arounds<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:16:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; ping is good too because it checks every minute or so, where as snmp only kicks off every 5 minutes or so<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:17:40] &lt;konfoo&gt; ah ok<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:17:55] &lt;jb&gt; not to mention snmp can occasionaly crash<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:18:03] &lt;jb&gt; (smmpd)<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:18:17] &lt;jb&gt; i'd rather rely on ICMP<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:18:45] &lt;konfoo&gt; is there any way to log ping failures to the zensyslog file?<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:18:51] &lt;konfoo&gt; so i can pull those into splunk<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:20:06] &lt;konfoo&gt; i cranked up the verbose level but didnt notice anything relevant going into the file<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:20:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; zenping logs to $ZENHOME/logs/zenping.log<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:20:54] &lt;konfoo&gt; ah so it does <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:22:04] &lt;konfoo&gt; well thats that sorted then <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:22:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can look at changing the logpath for the zenping daemon (and other daemons) under Settings-&gt;Daemons-&gt;Edit Config<br/> [27-Jul-2009 13:22:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

That might work.<br/> [28-Jul-2009 09:59:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; That's really the only way that I can think of doing it, and the code would probably be simpler<br/><span> [28-Jul-2009 09:59:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

he wants to do it based on the status of a port though<br/> [28-Jul-2009 10:01:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well, if you modify the second example to check the status of a port on the dc1_router as opposed to the getPingStatus, that should work<br/> [28-Jul-2009 10:01:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but the problem is that the port status doesn't get properly updated unless modeled<br/> [28-Jul-2009 10:01:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; hence the need for the threshold to monitor port operational status<br/> [28-Jul-2009 10:02:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; so he'd basically have to do it backwards, apply something to the threshold transform that kicks off a function to clear tickets for a device when it sees a specific port on a specific device as being down<br/> [28-Jul-2009 10:02:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then put a delay for notification that's a bit longer than his polling cycle, not sure how well it'd work<br/> [28-Jul-2009 10:02:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's really the only solution I can think of<br/> [28-Jul-2009 10:03:07] &lt;Dieterbe&gt;

not really. i thought the developers guide was meant for people who want to work on zenoss' code<br/> [28-Jul-2009 10:20:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, the dev guide is more geared towards database manipulation, adding, removing, etc...<br/> [28-Jul-2009 10:21:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

I get this info via snmptraps, but dont update the int statuses<br/> [28-Jul-2009 11:28:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, traps are alright, but I prefer to poll since that way you're only getting alerts for ports that you actually want to monitor<br/> [28-Jul-2009 11:28:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; traps work fine if you want to monitor everything<br/> [28-Jul-2009 11:29:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; but on a 48 port switch I don't necessarily care about the 36 or so user ports on it<br/> [28-Jul-2009 11:29:12] &lt;rmatte&gt;

rmatte: maybe because its operationally down? not sure but perhaps zenoss looks at that status as deems because it is set to that status it no longer sends events<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:13:43] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: are you setting the right status .. eg operdown might not be the correct one to set<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:13:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; it looks right<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:14:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; although you may be right, the port is technically administratively down right now<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:15:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't get why that'd make a difference though, Zenoss should still try to poll the port<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:15:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; since it's set to be monitored<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:16:54] &lt;rocket&gt; there is goofy code trying to be smart and skip stuff when the port is intentionally down<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:17:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmmm<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:17:33] &lt;rocket&gt; again thats from memory of me digging around so I cant remember exactly what its doing without looking again<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:17:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's kind of dumb though, if a port is down it should still poll it as long as it's set to monitor it<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:18:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; what if you remodel and the port shows as down after the remodel but you want to monitor it, it won't monitor?<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:18:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; seems kind of weird<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:18:32] &lt;rocket&gt; I would agree there .. except in the case of a cisco for example if the port is down administratively it doesnt make sense to monitor a port the admin has turned off from cisco<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:18:49] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: I would guess it wont monitor<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:18:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but I'm not setting it admin down, I'm setting it operationally down<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:18:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is different<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:19:17] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: I hope you are correct and I am wrong <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:19:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; now the port is active on the device, so it should technically poll it, see that it's up, and send a clear event (resulting in the transform setting port status back to active)<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:20:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it doesn't then that's quite bad design<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:20:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you may be right, I'll set the port status back to active and see if that's the case<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:23:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, I set it back to active, let's see if that's the case...<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:26:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I received a threshold of operational status restored message, which should have been transformed but didn't<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:27:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, because it came in with a capital T at the start for some reason<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:27:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:27:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; bizarre<br/> [28-Jul-2009 15:47:05] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you need to copy $ZENHOME/var/Data.fs from the backup to the same spot on the prod box<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:39:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; stop zenoss before you do<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:40:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; then delete the .zec and start it up, and hopefully we'll have a working database again<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:40:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; copy over the Data.fs.index file as well<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:40:48] &lt;jb&gt; mrayzenoss: looks like there are a few postfix-snmp hackjobs..<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:42:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can also just restore the entire box if it's a full backup, up to you<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:44:08] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Ok, back for a bit<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:44:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:46:07] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Do the Backups from the Backups tab actually back up the Data.fs...?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:46:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not sure, I don't use that system for backups<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:46:45] &lt;TBKDan&gt; -rw-r--r-- 1 zenoss zenoss 365298006 Jul 28 16:47 2009-07-28-20-46-56.fs<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:46:47] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Maybe....?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:46:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:46:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you need to use zenrestore<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:47:09] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Should zenoss be running for a zenrestore?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:47:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:47:47] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Zenrestore is running<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:47:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:47:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; cross your fingers hehe<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:48:04] &lt;TBKDan&gt; My hands are crossed lol<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:48:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; what are you using for hosting vms?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:48:14] &lt;TBKDan&gt; (Mostly because it's friggin freezing in this room)<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:48:19] &lt;TBKDan&gt; VMWare ESX<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:48:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; free edition?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:48:37] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Well, using ESXi for this particular host, licensed though<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:48:45] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Most of our ESXi boxes are the free<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:48:53] &lt;TBKDan&gt; For now at least<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:49:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, if it's licensed does that give you ability to clone vms on the fly?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:49:21] &lt;TBKDan&gt; It would appear so<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:49:30] &lt;TBKDan&gt; (Using it through VC)<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:49:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should setup schedules cloning of that vm<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:49:35] &lt;TBKDan&gt; zenrestore finished<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:49:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; scheduled*<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:49:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; we clone all of our zenoss boxes at midnight every night<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:49:48] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Yeah, I need to get a better backup strategy for our linux boxes<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:49:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; that way we always have a 24 hour copy to restore from<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:49:59] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Clone or snapshot?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:50:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; clone<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:50:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; snapshot is different<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:50:09] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Why not just snapshot?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:50:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; because a snapshot stops the machine from running while it's being taken<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:50:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; basically freezes it up<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:50:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; the clones don't interfere with operation<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:51:06] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Does it freeze it up if you don't snapshot the running memory? (Haven't tried)<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:51:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, we clone them from the SAN to the local disks on each server, so that the clones are stored in a separate location<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:51:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; TBKDan: I believe it still does<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:51:48] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Hm.&#160; Well when we snapshot, it's usually only unresponsive for a few seconds at most.<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:52:01] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Anyway, zenrestore is done<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:52:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:52:10] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Anything else to do before I fire up zenoss?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:52:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; fire it up and hopefully it'll be fixed<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:52:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; not that I'm aware of<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:52:31] &lt;TBKDan&gt; *drumroll*<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:53:16] &lt;TBKDan&gt; zendmd came up without that error<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:53:20] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Should I try a re-index?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:53:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, login to Zenoss<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:53:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; can you see the devices?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:53:30] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Yup<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:53:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, don't reindex yet<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:53:37] &lt;TBKDan&gt; I see all devices<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:53:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, load up the zenpacks page<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:53:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; are the cisco and httpmon listed?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:53:53] &lt;TBKDan&gt; It's taking forever, so probably will be<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:53:54] &lt;TBKDan&gt; lol<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:54:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol, k<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:54:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so yeh, we want to reindex then<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:54:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; for starters<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:54:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; (good thing you have that backup, if we screw things up again we can restore)<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:54:46] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Yup <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:54:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; though hopefully we can fix this cleanly<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:55:00] &lt;TBKDan&gt; And man, our external monitoring service (to make sure the internal monitor stays up <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/>) is going crazy<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:55:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:55:36] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Still waiting for the zenpack page<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:55:41] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Should I wait for that to load<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:55:42] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Nvm<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:55:43] &lt;TBKDan&gt;

Hmm... i might not have tried to putz with the monitor at this point yet<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:56:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; reindex and commit for starters<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:56:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; if that goes cleanly, then we'll proceed<br/> [30-Jul-2009 10:56:26] &lt;TBKDan&gt;

ok, now execute the zendmd command for the cisco pack<br/> [30-Jul-2009 11:00:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; and commit<br/> [30-Jul-2009 11:00:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; was the httpmonitor zenpack installed during the time of that backup, or was that something you just tried today?<br/> [30-Jul-2009 11:01:12] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Backup was from Tues night, I might have tried the http monitor yesterday<br/> [30-Jul-2009 11:01:25] &lt;TBKDan&gt; I thought I had tried it earlier, but apparently I was mistaken<br/> [30-Jul-2009 11:01:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so the backup shouldn't contain any httpmon stuff then<br/> [30-Jul-2009 11:01:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is good, because now we can try to install it cleanly<br/> [30-Jul-2009 11:01:48] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Well<br/> [30-Jul-2009 11:01:53] &lt;TBKDan&gt; It didn't show up in the zenpack list<br/> [30-Jul-2009 11:02:01] &lt;TBKDan&gt; But it shows up in $ZENHOME/ZenPacks....<br/> [30-Jul-2009 11:02:08] &lt;rmatte&gt;

that's awesome too<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:48:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and I'm here most days<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:48:50] &lt;zahna&gt; perfect<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:49:54] &lt;zahna&gt; btw, are there any plans to bring a zenoss package to non-x86 platforms, like say, debian sparc64?<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:50:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, you can build from source<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:50:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I run Debian PPC<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:50:26] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and eventually we'll get into the distros<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:50:31] &lt;zahna&gt;

I can do an snmpwalk if I give the -Cc option.

My problem is that the device is showing snmp agent down despite the fact that its not. Modeling it works, and the snmpwalk user command works with the mod mentioned. which would indicate that the agent is not down.<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:54:35] &lt;konfoo&gt; is it just me or is wmi monitoring a complete clusterfuck<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:55:55] &lt;cgibbons&gt; it's a little less than complete in the Core version of the product<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:57:03] &lt;konfoo&gt; little less? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:57:15] &lt;konfoo&gt; my point was that wmi in general... bothers me<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:57:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; WMI is known to be much better in the Enterprise version<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:57:45] &lt;cgibbons&gt; how come?<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:57:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; the core version has limited support<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:58:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; though there are 3 new WMI community ZenPacks coming out at some point<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:58:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; zahna: the hardware appliance wasn't super popular, but will is available through Sales if someone really wants it<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:58:45] &lt;konfoo&gt; the number of ports and required admin account amongst other things<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:59:32] &lt;konfoo&gt; anyone here using dell openmanage on remote boxes?<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:59:33] &lt;cgibbons&gt; You can configure it without an Admin account but I don't find it to be worth the effort.<br/> [31-Jul-2009 12:59:41] &lt;konfoo&gt; cgibbons: nod<br/> [31-Jul-2009 13:00:00] &lt;cgibbons&gt; Ports are easy, you can ratchet that down to 1 or 2 if you really want.<br/> [31-Jul-2009 13:00:19] &lt;konfoo&gt; im considering using snare instead<br/> [31-Jul-2009 13:00:22] &lt;cgibbons&gt; I assume you're putting devices behind firewalls where it matters?<br/> [31-Jul-2009 13:00:38] &lt;konfoo&gt; yeah naturally and blocking with ACLs on the borders<br/> [31-Jul-2009 13:00:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; konfoo: most of the Windows issues in Core are issues in Enterprise<br/> [31-Jul-2009 13:01:04] &lt;brice&gt; If the OS Make is returning Unknown on a model of a Win2k3 R2 box...anyway I can set it to Microsoft without the model resetting it?
