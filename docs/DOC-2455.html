I see the recent mail thread regarding the ping only monitoring in the archives... was there a resolution? I want to monitor a device which doesn't have an snmp daemon. Is there a way to do it?</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:28:32]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; b00mer: Yes</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:28:46]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; looking...</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:30:14]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; You create a new status monitor and set the ping retries to 0</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:31:49]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; chet: do you mean "Ping Tries"</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:31:50]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; ?</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:32:14]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; oops, yes.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:32:31]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; At least that was the solution posted to the list.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:32:39]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; ok... just starting out with zenoss... how do I associate that to a specific device?</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:32:52]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; Go the the Edit tab for a device, status monitor is a drop-down.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:34:48]&#160; &lt;PerlStalker&gt; Is it possible to create a user which can only see certain devices?</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:35:30]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; no, not yet.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 10:36:01]&#160; &lt;PerlStalker&gt; Bummer. Alright, thanks.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:02:49] &lt;b00mer&gt; another question... thinking about migrating from Nagios to Zenoss... and in Nagios there is parenting (has some issues, but works ok) of devices... is that in Zenoss? Is that the idea of the zenmodeler? and if I am doing some ping-only monitoring, is it as effective as it will need to be, if not can I add relationships manually? </span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:03:52]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; btw: Thanks chet... testing out your explanation above.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:11:19] &lt;chet&gt; Good question, b00mer. I'm not 100% clear on how the parenting works in Zenoss, but here's my understanding..</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:12:51] &lt;chet&gt; The zenping process uses the knowledge of your routing tables to build a hierarchy of systems, thus automatically discovering your parent relationships. It can determine if a host is unreachable or down using this data. The other processes like zenstatus or zenperfsnmp can that use this host down data to avoid polling hosts that are down.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:13:17] &lt;chet&gt; I've been meaning to run a test of this capability to see how well it really works in the real world, but haven't had the chance yet.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:13:47]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; chet: you work for Zenoss?&#160; I see your in MD?</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:13:49]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; You can't currently add relationships manually, but this is slated for the next release.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:13:56]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; No.. just a user.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:14:08]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; Oddly enough I work right down the street.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:14:36]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; you using this in a production environment or just testing it out?</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:14:59]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; or both </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:15:00]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; Just testing right now.. having it shadow my existing Nagios system.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:15:09]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; thats what I want to do</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:15:23]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; I just have a number of devices that are over VPNs and don't have SNMP</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:15:45]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; and I hate the tunnel goes down and 50 emails go out scenario </span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:15:55]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; when one would have sufficed </span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:16:14]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; Yeah.. I think you're SOL until the next release then.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:16:31]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; so far... as a nagios guy... how do you like it?&#160; impressions?</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:16:36]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; You can manually hack the routes in, but it is anything but straightforward.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:17:15] &lt;chet&gt; I love it.. I can't wait to replace Nagios with it. Unfortunately there are still a few things Nagios does better.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:17:43]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; Sometimes better is just defined as differently.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:18:49] &lt;b00mer&gt; yea... there wasn't as much of a learning curve looking at zenoss as I would have imagined... but still I don't even remotely understand the basics yet.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:18:50]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; b00mer: I'm using it in production and love it</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:19:08]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; I used OpenNMS before though and not Nagios</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:19:25] &lt;b00mer&gt; its funny... it currently tells me when a host comes back online via email, but not when it goes offline</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:19:28]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; b00mer: If you don't already know Python, learn it and Zenoss becomes oodles better.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:19:53]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; yea... php and perl... but its on my list of things to dive in to</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:20:41]&#160; &lt;PerlStalker&gt; I've trying to avoid finding a reason to learn python.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:20:48]&#160; &lt;PerlStalker&gt; Seem like I can't avoid it any more.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:20:49] &lt;b00mer&gt; creiht: I always found OpenNMS to be a bear to get started with... tried twice and both times lost interest</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:20:54]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; heh.. I didn't know a lick until I started using Zenoss.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:20:58]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; haha</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:21:04]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; Yeah... It is a pain to get setup</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:21:19]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; More of a pain to extend.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:21:25]&#160; &lt;PerlStalker&gt; Indeed.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:21:25]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; We lost our monitoring server, and I didn't want to go through setting up ONMS again</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:21:39]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; That's when I found Zenoss, and haven't looked back</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:21:42]&#160; &lt;PerlStalker&gt; I tried to get opennms to talk to our APs and it was a PITA.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:22:03]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; Once you get it working, there are some nice things about it</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:22:11]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; so creiht ... you have the issues of parenting licked?</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:22:34]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; luckily... I don't have to worry about that</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:22:44]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; I just monitor servers</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:22:51]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; Not network gear</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:23:10]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; I've tried that ping monitor... and so far no pings to the box being monitored</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:25:02] &lt;chet&gt; There wouldn't even be any if you set the ping tries to 100. The reason it works is that the default zenping process sees that it isn't the monitor for that device, so it doesn't check it. The monitor you created will never run.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:26:01]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; I tried setting it to 0</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:26:06]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; now back to 2</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:26:23]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; then played with the maximum failures from 1440 to 5</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:28:14]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; b00mer: Zenoss caches configs, and reloads every 20 minutes</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:28:26]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; So if you make a change, it might take a while to register</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:28:30]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; unless you restart zenoss</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:28:46]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; yea... its been 20 minutes since I did it... tried at 10:30 EST</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:29:38]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; b00mer: How did you add the device?</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:30:11]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; "Add Device" then set "Discovery Protocol" to none.... and set </span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:30:23]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; "Status Monitors" to "ping"</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:30:53]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; I thought you didn't want it to ping.</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:31:11] &lt;creiht&gt; If I recall correctly... all you should have to do is set the "Discovery Protocol" to none</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:31:18]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; And it should check ping</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:31:24]&#160; &lt;creiht&gt; leave all the rest the default</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:31:40]&#160; &lt;b00mer&gt; ok</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:32:11] &lt;b00mer&gt; chet: no... all I want it to do is ping... for devices where there is no snmp or don't have access to snmp community</span><br/><span>[01-Mar-2007 11:32:36] &lt;chet&gt; ok, then I gave you bad instructions.

&lt;bsmith&gt; ./zendisc run --net x.x.x.x</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:47:14]&#160; &lt;bsmith&gt; as uid zenoss from ./zenoss/bin</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:47:39]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; and that'll put the new machines into /Discovered?</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:47:43]&#160; &lt;bsmith&gt; yup.</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:48:03]&#160; &lt;bsmith&gt; so, you can't get the HW/SW info during that discovery if i understand correct.</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:48:19]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; the zendisc one?</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:48:23] &lt;bsmith&gt; you have to move them, and then wait and let the discovery service finish the job. this is what i've learned</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:48:29]&#160; &lt;bsmith&gt; yup</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:48:46]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; so i just wait (a while?) for this zendisc to finish?</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:48:48]&#160; &lt;bsmith&gt; or else go into individual devices and do 'Collect' from the manage menu</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:49:01]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; i did 'Collect' for a few things</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:49:03]&#160; &lt;bsmith&gt; yea. my Class-C's with ~40 hosts took ~30 minutes per</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:49:06]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; I got the mountlist, for example, </span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:49:18]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; but I didn't get how much space was left</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:49:25]&#160; &lt;bsmith&gt; but that was because a couple of boxes had no snmp and therefore had to timeout</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:49:37]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; lots of my boxes have no snmp and must timeout</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:49:38]&#160; &lt;bsmith&gt; right, i'm right there with ya spec</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:50:05]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; Spec: You won't get the free space stats until zenperfsnmp has had a chance to run over it.</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:50:17]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; can i manually make zenperfsnmp do it's thing?</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:50:18]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; That's not actually part of modeling strangely enough.</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:50:23]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; Yeah.. zenperfsnmp restart</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:50:51]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; Still might take 10 or 15 minutes to get the RRD files into a usable state.</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:51:22]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; So for one of the server's that's already under Devices/Server/Linux/Debian/foobarserver</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:51:36]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; Clicking on "Collect" doesn't give me Hardware or Software information, </span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:51:52]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; do I have to run zendisc specifically against the ip of that host?</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:52:08]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; nope</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:52:31]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; That would just indicate that the system isn't exposing that information through SNMP.</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:53:32]&#160; &lt;Spec&gt; How do I get snmpd to expose all the information that zenoss can use?</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:56:08]&#160; &lt;chet&gt; For a Linux system, there's currently no good way to get hardware information out of snmp.</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:56:38]&#160; &lt;bsmith&gt; you mean like CPU type etc. right?</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:57:13]&#160; &lt;bsmith&gt; yea. like on my HP DL385's the snmpd is tweaked to call this:</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:57:16]&#160; &lt;bsmith&gt; dlmod cmaX /usr/lib64/libcmaX64.so</span><br/><span>[23-Mar-2007 15:57:22]&#160;

&lt;oubiwann&gt; they're learning as they go</span><br/><span>[30-Mar-2007 15:02:28] &lt;oubiwann&gt; and they sometimes don't believe it when they encounter other developers that have more experience then they do</span><br/><span>[30-Mar-2007 15:02:44]&#160;
