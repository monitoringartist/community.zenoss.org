well, we already have a snapshot of the server in it's current state, so if anything screws up we can just restore that way</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 13:52:37] **raw__&gt; it's a vmware instance running on an ESX box</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 13:52:51] **mrayzenoss&gt; even better</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 13:53:03] **raw__&gt; oh wait, do you need the backup files to restore after the upgrade?</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 13:53:09] **raw__&gt; or are they just a precaution?</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 13:53:19] **mrayzenoss&gt; precaution</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 13:53:28] **mrayzenoss&gt; hmm... maybe not</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 13:53:35] **raw__&gt; oh well, I'll do it anyways</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 13:53:40] **raw__&gt;

when both boxes have the exact same zenpacks on them</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 14:11:14] **mrayzenoss&gt; that is odd</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 14:11:49] **raw__&gt; given, I do have a Cisco Mibs zenpack that I created which has like 1288 Mibs in it</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 14:11:52] **raw__&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 14:12:08] **mrayzenoss&gt; sounds like the ProLiant MIBs ZenPack</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 14:12:10] **raw__&gt; that might play a part in the slowness</span><br/><span> [02-Mar-2009 14:12:19] **mrayzenoss&gt;

Noting that down.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 08:53:09] **VBNewUser&gt; one more question: I read somewhere in the datasheets about "remote administration".

You can simultaneously use nagios and zenoss as separate services. when you will finish configuration of zenoss you can shutdown the nagios. as for me zenoss is more powerful and useful then nagios.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:02:00] **cain22&gt; mondrad: how'd you get your name to change...once im in the channel /nick doesn't work for me</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:02:38] sergeymasushko is now known as sergey1</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:02:50] **VBNewUser&gt; sergeymasushko: Thank you.

hence 22 instead of ___</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:06:50] **raw__&gt; VBNewUser: they just add functionality to Nagios, for example, if you had a Nagios plugin for monitoring a specific type of network appliance and wanted to install it in Zenoss you could</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:07:10] **raw__&gt;

and you can even monitor via ssh if you want</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:13:57] **VBNewUser&gt; can you help me with any pointers?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:14:36] **raw__&gt; sergey1: don't think you can since you need to load some scripts on to the server itself for it to work, read up on it in the admin guide</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:15:37] **raw__&gt; VBNewUser: can't really offer any "pointers", Zenoss is not easy to learn, you need to read, read, read, every guide you can find, install it, configure it, trial and error</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:15:54] **raw__&gt; once you figure it out though it's great</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:16:26] **raw__&gt; the main things you should read up on is installing mibs, installing zenpacks, creating event transforms, and creating reporting templates</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:16:29] **raw__&gt; for starters</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:16:31] **VBNewUser&gt; raw__: I get the feeling that Zenoss is difficult for someone who is just getting started with NMS.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:16:54] **VBNewUser&gt; Are there any other products which offer similar capabilities with a lesser learning curve?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:17:05] **raw__&gt; If you don't understand how SNMP works, or how WMI works, etc... you'll have a rough time</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:17:26] **raw__&gt; I don't know of any simple plug and go products that don't cost money</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:17:43] **raw__&gt; what exactly are you going to be monitoring?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:17:47] **raw__&gt; and on how many devices?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:18:24] **ke4qqq&gt; VBNewUser: honestly Zenoss is about as easy as it gets</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:18:37] **VBNewUser&gt; standard infrastructure like network devices, servers et al.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:18:49] **VBNewUser&gt; could be up to 5000 devices.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:19:07] **raw__&gt; Zenoss is really easy to use once it's all setup, certain aspects of the config can be a pain</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:19:46] **ke4qqq&gt; raw__: yeah but it's all a matter of how much you want to configure - just adding a device with SNMP already enabled isn't too bad.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:19:54] **raw__&gt; is anyone on yet who has experience configuring Zenoss for LDAP authentication?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:20:09] **cain22&gt; negative</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:20:15] **raw__&gt; I've run in to a stupid roadblock where it should be pulling down the groups from the LDAP server but it's not</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:20:20] **VBNewUser&gt; I had some questions about Zenoss internals and features for Managed Service Providers.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:20:20] **raw__&gt; no idea why, driving me insane</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:20:49] **ke4qqq&gt; VBNewUser: ask away - we'll answer what we can.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:20:49] **VBNewUser&gt; Any special features which can be useful for MSPs?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:21:14] **raw__&gt; I work for an MSP and we are developing our new toolset around it</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:21:19] **raw__&gt; I can tell you it's more than adequate</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:21:31] **VBNewUser&gt; (Note, I am just at the documentation stage, I haven't even installed the product)</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:21:47] **VBNewUser&gt; does it allow branding, change of logos etc?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:21:48] **raw__&gt; Just install it on a box and try it out, see what you think</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:22:03] **raw__&gt; no idea what the policy is on changing branding</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:22:26] **VBNewUser&gt; about storage, it uses a&#160; database, right?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:22:47] **raw__&gt; we are simply integrating it with a ticketing system and a portal, clients will be able to view tickets and reports but won't ever even see Zenoss</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:23:10] **raw__&gt; it uses Zope database for all settings and such and a MySQL database to store event log</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:23:44] **VBNewUser&gt; ok.. So, how does it segregate data belonging to multiple customers?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:24:01] **VBNewUser&gt; Do I have a mechanism to define new customers and add discovered devices to the same?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:24:25] **VBNewUser&gt; like Customer 1: dev 1, 2,3; Cust2: dev 4, 5, 6, etc?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:24:39] **raw__&gt; yeh, you can just create new device groups for each client</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:24:44] **raw__&gt; and move the devices in to the groups</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:24:51] **VBNewUser&gt; groups and sub groups also?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:24:55] **raw__&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:24:59] **VBNewUser&gt; or only one level of grouping?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:25:08] **raw__&gt; you could have /Devices/Customer1/Server</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:25:11] **raw__&gt; you could have /Devices/Customer1/Network</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:25:15] **sergey1&gt; raw__: you do not understand my question. I asked how can I enable monitoring of 22 port (ssh) on a device such as 443 (https).</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:25:20] **raw__&gt; etc...</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:25:44] **VBNewUser&gt; and can I generate reports for cust1. all devices, cust2. selected devices, etc?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:27:04] **raw__&gt; the reporting features in the core version are not very powerful</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:27:15] **raw__&gt; the enterprise version has reporting features similar to that</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:27:35] **raw__&gt; sergey1: I still don't understand your question, what does port 443 have to do with ssh?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:27:53] **VBNewUser&gt; and then schedule these reports?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:28:03] **raw__&gt; with the enterprise version I believe so</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:28:07] **raw__&gt; not with the core version</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:28:19] **VBNewUser&gt; I appreciate your help</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:28:22] **raw__&gt; we are actually writing our own reporting scripts to generate reports from Zenoss data</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:28:35] **VBNewUser&gt; using Webservices/ API?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:28:37] **raw__&gt; since we don't want to have to purchase the enterprise version as it's too expensive for what we're going to be doing with it</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:28:55] **raw__&gt; API</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:29:09] **VBNewUser&gt; I am looking at something similar.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:29:18] **raw__&gt; but that's going to be a major project which won't be done for months</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:29:32] **VBNewUser&gt; I need to be able to pull everything from the database and integrate it with our product.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:29:46] **raw__&gt; then you need to hire developers</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:29:51] **VBNewUser&gt; so basically I need almost the entire raw data...</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:29:51] **cain22&gt; you can monitor IP services though...</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:30:17] **VBNewUser&gt; raw__: I have a team. </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:30:31] **raw__&gt;

raw__: how can I enable monitoring of some port for 10 devices.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:32:32] **raw__&gt; I'm going to show you that in a second</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:33:24] **cain22&gt; add the service, and tell it what protocol it is</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:33:29] **raw__&gt; Click on Services on the left, then click on IpService, then click on privileged, then type ssh in to the search box and hit enter, then click on ssh</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:33:48] **raw__&gt; then go to the edit tab</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:33:57] **raw__&gt; change monitor from false to true</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:34:06] **raw__&gt; and voila, it'll automatically be monitored on all devices</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:34:21] **raw__&gt; it'll take maybe like an hour to show up on all devices</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:35:23] **sergey1&gt; ok. thank you.</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:35:50] **raw__&gt; np</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:36:30] **raw__&gt; if it doesn't show up on certain devices just remodel them</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:36:35] **raw__&gt; it should show up after a remodel</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 09:36:41] **sergey1&gt;

ok...</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 12:56:47] **MajereDB8&gt; so the pseudo code would look something like if evt.details == MyKeyword, then If evt.summary contains "3letters," then truncate evt.summary, zenackevents --evid=evt.summary</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 12:57:07] **MajereDB8&gt;

?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 13:04:27] **MajereDB8&gt; raw__: well, specifically, zenpop3 is generating an e-mail, and placing the subject line into evt.summary, and the e-mail body into evt.details</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 13:04:53] **MajereDB8&gt;

that'll strip out the first 3 characters</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 13:06:51] **MajereDB8&gt; do strings work like c, where the first character os 0?</span><br/><span> [03-Mar-2009 13:07:17] **raw__&gt;

so if you go to Settings-&gt;Versions it looks OK?</span><br/><span> [04-Mar-2009 11:02:02] **magnachef&gt; yeah, it's showing 2.4.4</span><br/><span> [04-Mar-2009 11:02:27] **magnachef&gt; zope 2.8.8</span><br/><span> [04-Mar-2009 11:03:28] **magnachef&gt; so for python versioning, it doesn't matter that I ran --nodeps for the upgrade and have python 2.3.3 on my server, because Zenoss comes with its own version</span><br/><span> [04-Mar-2009 11:03:45] **mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, the only dep for the RPM would've been MySQL</span><br/><span> [04-Mar-2009 11:04:31] **magnachef&gt; yeah, and I'm showing version 5.0.24 for that</span><br/><span> [04-Mar-2009 11:04:53] **magnachef&gt;

you can change the modeler cycle interval</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:27:46] **tripitaka&gt; am I getting this the right way up: zenpacks are associated with a device class, so all I have to do is to put a discovered device in the correct class, and it will start to use all the right zenpacks?</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:27:54] **kisielk&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:28:01] **kisielk&gt; more specifically, that's not a function of zenpacks</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:28:06] **kisielk&gt; but of templates</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:28:13] **kisielk&gt; but zenpacks often contain templates</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:28:33] **kisielk&gt; although they can contain other things as well (SNMP mibs, modeler plugins, etc)</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:29:15] **tripitaka&gt; ok, so a device class has templates associated with it, and those templates may come from a zenpack</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:29:40] **tripitaka&gt; where do I set what templates are associated with each device class?</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:30:04] **kisielk&gt; go to a class</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:30:20] **kisielk&gt; click the arrow</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:30:23] **tripitaka&gt; ah, nvm, i see</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:30:28] **tripitaka&gt; it's in the obvious place</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:30:32] **kisielk&gt; or rather, the templates tab </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:30:56] **kisielk&gt; I'm still getting used to the UI myself</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:31:09] **tripitaka&gt; class&#160; - templates - add template</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:31:16] **tripitaka&gt; I am in a twisty maze of drop downs, all alike</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:31:47] **kisielk&gt; haha</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:31:52] **kisielk&gt; The thing that bugs me the most</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:32:01] **kisielk&gt; is when I see the ... &gt; in the drop down menu</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:32:07] **kisielk&gt; I expect another menu to pop out from that</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:32:14] **kisielk&gt; but it shows a dialog instead</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:32:18] **kisielk&gt; slightly maddening</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:32:45] **kisielk&gt; because on the main arrow, the &gt; means another drop-down pops up</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:32:50] **kisielk&gt; but on the sub arrows, it leads to a dialog</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:32:52] **kisielk&gt; O_o</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:37:12] **unpaidbill&gt; anyone know how to add a bunch of oids to get a total for a data source?</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:37:27] **tripitaka&gt; well, on the plus side, I'm as competent with zenoss after two hours as I was with nagios after about 8 years.</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:37:33] **unpaidbill&gt; using snmp for windows i can get a list of all the processes and the memory they use, as well as total memory</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:37:33] **kisielk&gt; unpaidbill: in a graph?</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:37:45] **unpaidbill&gt; yeah in a graph</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:37:51] **kisielk&gt; just make a stacked graph</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:38:05] **kisielk&gt; with the total as a line</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:38:13] **unpaidbill&gt; problem is that the oids change in 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.5.1.1.2 tree</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:38:19] **unpaidbill&gt; 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.5.1.1.2.XXXX</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:38:21] **tripitaka&gt; how do you graph a given oid?</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:38:23] **kisielk&gt; ah, I see</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:38:28] **unpaidbill&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:38:31] **kisielk&gt; tripitaka: make a template</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:39:01] **kisielk&gt; unpaidbill: why not just look at the used memory vs. total memory graph? or do you only want to graph some processes?</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:41:41] **unpaidbill&gt; that's what i am trying to do</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:41:48] **unpaidbill&gt; but windows snmp doesnt show me used memory</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:41:57] **unpaidbill&gt; at least not that i can find</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:42:07] **unpaidbill&gt; i can get total memory and memory usage for each process</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:42:25] **kisielk&gt; I thought if you just put your server in the /Servers/Windows device class</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:42:28] **kisielk&gt; it will get it for you</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:42:39] **unpaidbill&gt; doesnt work</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:42:48] **unpaidbill&gt; maybe it works if it's actually running windows server</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:42:56] **unpaidbill&gt; but the OID doesnt exist in windows 2000 professional</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:43:04] **kisielk&gt; hm you're right</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:43:06] **kisielk&gt; I don't get it in XP either</span><br/><span> [12-Mar-2009 18:43:13] **unpaidbill&gt;

so you have to add your datapoints to the graph, set them to not draw a line, create a custom data point and use the rrdtool RPN stuff to do the math</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:29:33] **unpaidbill&gt; very nifty! so in RPN i put current_capacity_toner_current_capacity,maxcapacity_toner_maxcapacity,/,100,*</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:29:36] **unpaidbill&gt; and viola.</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:29:41] **unpaidbill&gt; i now have a percentage</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:33:07] **rhett_&gt; damn rpn!</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:42:17] **unpaidbill&gt; so you have to make the CDEF in 'add custom' which creates a variable, then you have to make another custom of type 'LINE' that references the CDEF you made..</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:42:22] **unpaidbill&gt; ok i'm like a pro now</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:42:37] **rhett_&gt; correct</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:42:50] **unpaidbill&gt; rrdtool has never been so fun</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:42:53] **rhett_&gt; its nice when things work isnt it</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:42:58] **rhett_&gt; haha its fun</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:43:06] **unpaidbill&gt; i used to do all my graphs with perl and rrdtool</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:43:13] **unpaidbill&gt; kind of a pain in the as ssometimes, still fun</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:43:20] **unpaidbill&gt; but man, zenoss makes this EXCITING</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:43:27] **rhett_&gt; i just wish it was easier to apply cdefs&#160; in zenoss</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:43:30] **unpaidbill&gt; so fast and easy to generate everything</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:43:41] **unpaidbill&gt; yeah the process does seem a bit cumbersome</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:44:05] **rhett_&gt; i suppose thats why i have both cacti and zenoss</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:44:20] **unpaidbill&gt; i've never heard of cacti</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:44:37] **unpaidbill&gt; oh wow</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:45:10] **rhett_&gt; also ive found the rra's for the zenoss graphs to not be accurate for monthly views and waht not so what we're getting billed for bandwidth does not show correctly in zenoss for my 95th usage but is pretty accurate in my cacti stuff</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:45:27] **rhett_&gt; it was almost 2 megs off (zenoss)</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:48:48] **unpaidbill&gt; weird</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:50:52] **rhett_&gt; that shows the value of the rra's though</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 17:51:52] **rhett_&gt; i would also like to see more granular control over the time frames on graphs being show. like be able to set the dates from and to and show the data rather then clicking weekly/monthly and using arrows to navigate forward and back</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 18:24:36] **unpaidbill&gt; yeah, that would be nice.&#160; maybe in 2.4</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 18:24:44] **unpaidbill&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 18:27:09] x-spec-t is now known as Spec</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 18:56:45] **unpaidbill&gt; is it possible to get the device issues portlet to show warnings? right now it's showing error/critical only</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 18:57:00] **unpaidbill&gt; i dont see anything in settings to change it though ,and nothing in the portlet configuration</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 18:57:17] **unpaidbill&gt; and it looks like it used t obe severity 3 or higher accordign to some random dude in the forums</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 20:33:31] **marl_scot&gt; hi folks, i have just installed zenoss from source (2.3.3) and i now have a very nice web frontend, i can add new devices, but dont appear to get any information back from them, also i have noticed that according to the manual, if i goto settings/users/admin/alerting rules i should see an 'add alerting rule' but i cant see this, anyone point me in the rite direction to solve this?</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 20:33:54] **marl_scot&gt; i should point out htat i dont seem to have any of the installed monitors etc that seem to be assumed by the manual</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 20:34:04] **marl_scot&gt; have i missed something in the install maybe?</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 22:46:59] **snowgod&gt; anyone around? I'm having a strange issue trying to create new IpServices in the webui - and I think I must be missing something obvious</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 22:54:35] **sergeymasushko&gt; what are you trying to add?</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 22:57:50] **snowgod&gt; Just a simple IpService for port 50 (tcp) called smtp_alt which the same expect setting as the stock smtp service</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 22:58:43] **snowgod&gt; It adds correctly, and shows up in the Services section. However, when I try to add it to a device, it says it can not find the service (after I complete the Add IpService dialog</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:04:01] **sergeymasushko&gt; try to add it by this way...</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:04:01] **sergeymasushko&gt; 1. open the 'OS' tab of needed device. 2. in the 'IP Services' section click on the 'Port' link. There should appear a list of available ports 3. click on a name on needed port... 4. set 'Monitor' to 'true'</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:06:52] **snowgod&gt; I don't see a "Port" link in the ip services section</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:07:28] **snowgod&gt; In the menu on the IpServices table, I see Add IpService, Lock IpService and Delete IpService</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:08:47] **sergeymasushko&gt; just click on the word 'Port' in the header ' Name Proto Port Ips Description Status M Lock' that below blue line </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:11:17] **snowgod&gt; that just resorts the list by Port, and shows currently unmonitored services. It doesn't let you add services that have not already been added to the device (either manually or by discovery)</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:14:01] **snowgod&gt; What I'm trying to do is manually configure services - rather than discovering them</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:15:33] **sergeymasushko&gt; actually I never tried to add IP services manually.</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:16:56] **snowgod&gt; oh </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><span> Well thanks for trying. I can add any of the "stock" services without a problem - it is just this service I created that is being problematic</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:17:24] **snowgod&gt; I even tried reindexing my ZODB, thinking that might help</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:19:06] **sergeymasushko&gt; do you have some custom scripts that you are using via zencommand?</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:21:09] **snowgod&gt; nope, this is a simple IpService - it is just like the stock smtp and http objects (polled by zenstatus)</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:21:35] **snowgod&gt; it is basically a copy of the stock smtp IpService, with the port and name changed</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:22:52] **sergeymasushko&gt; heh... my question is not relevant to your problem... that is something about my one.</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:23:29] **snowgod&gt; oh - I've played with zencommand a bit - what type of trouble are you having?</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:25:52] **sergeymasushko&gt; I've a shell script... it returns nothing when all is OK. but when something is wrong it returns a list of errors. How can I create an event in this case?</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:28:40] **snowgod&gt; Is the script running locally or on a remote host?</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:30:01] **sergeymasushko&gt; that one is running locally and in the debug I see that it works...</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:30:32] **snowgod&gt; ok - in order to generate events on an error, you need the shell script to exit with an exit code of 2</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:30:44] **snowgod&gt; just saying "exit 2" in bash should get the job done</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:32:27] **sergeymasushko&gt; thanks for the point. will try it.</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:33:04] **snowgod&gt; also, the way it parses output values (there are a few different options, I'm picking the simplest) is by using a pipe | to seperate the message from any values your returning (if this script is graphing anything in zenrrd)</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:33:30] **snowgod&gt; If you just want to give a message and no values, just put a pipe at the end of your error message</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:46:15] **sergeymasushko&gt; it returns a list of string like:</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:46:15] **sergeymasushko&gt; 6:1-88909@127.0.0.1</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:46:15] **sergeymasushko&gt; 25:1-88945@127.0.0.1</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:46:15] **sergeymasushko&gt; 33:1-88969@127.0.0.1</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:46:15] **sergeymasushko&gt; It would be great if I can create an event for each of them.</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:48:49] **snowgod&gt; I don't see a code path that would let you create more than one event on the output of a single zencommand</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:51:24] **sergeymasushko&gt; mmm ok. but, can I that returned list put into event message field for example?</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:52:03] **snowgod&gt; You can try putting a pipe at the end of the output</span><br/><span> [13-Mar-2009 23:57:20] **sergeymasushko&gt;

Does zenoss support a distributed model? Hub and spoke model with the use of HTTPS?</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 15:38:24] **Disconnect&gt; ok i'm confused. ntpmonitor is throwing offset errors. this is good. but i need to adjust it's ideas of warning/error. but when i go into the template, there are no thresholds set at all. just a data source. where should i be looking for the thresholds?</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 15:57:12] **lavermil&gt; hello are there any zenoss folks here?</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 15:58:52] **perr0&gt; no</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 15:59:04] **lavermil&gt; I am getting that idea.</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 15:59:18] **perr0&gt; actually this room is quite active</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 15:59:50] **perr0&gt; is this your first time here lavemil?</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:00:13] **lavermil&gt; I was in here about 1 year ago for about two weeks while I was giving zenoss a test run</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:00:52] **lavermil&gt; now that requirements have changed I have a rather simple architecture question that I need answered to see if it is able to support my needs.</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:02:37] **lavermil&gt; Does zenoss support a distributed model? Hub and spoke model with the use of HTTPS?</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:15:26] **Schwartz&gt; you can set up distributed collectors, though not natively with https as far as I can see, though you can just use stunnel and point the collector and hubs to localhost:port of the stunnel</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:16:39] **lavermil&gt; basically if the product doesn't do it natively then it is not acceptable. it needs to be able to support failure of communication and then bring up the connection again secured.</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:16:49] **lavermil&gt; that is the same issue I have with OpenNMS</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:16:59] **lavermil&gt; no support for this sort of architecture</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:26:48] **Schwartz&gt; I believe the enterprise version is more geared towards doing this</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:26:56] **Schwartz&gt; I could be wrong though, I'm just a user myself</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:27:06] **lavermil&gt; got ya</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:27:06] **Schwartz&gt; in fact, trying to set up distributed monitoring as we speak</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:27:21] **lavermil&gt; getting a hold of a zenoss sales person is seeming to be not fun</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:27:24] **lavermil&gt; I would think it would be easy</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:27:32] **lavermil&gt; but I am thinking of bigger companies I guess.</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:28:02] **Schwartz&gt; indeed. the small to medium commercial monitoring solutions companies seem to be a pretty small market.</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:28:22] **Schwartz&gt; unfortunately, I didn't have the money for spectrum</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:28:39] **Schwartz&gt; and I loathe nagios.</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:28:55] **lavermil&gt; I have money to spend, I just need the product that will work for me</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:29:19] **lavermil&gt; I really need a small - medium setup but I will be buying many of these for each one of my products I sell.</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:29:25] **lavermil&gt; spectrum...what is that?</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:30:44] **lavermil&gt; you odn't happen to know the default password for the zenoss webapp for the vmware edition?</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:31:59] **Schwartz&gt; it may not actually be around any more. originally done by cabletron, then split into 3 different companies, enterasys, riverstone and .. something</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:32:14] **Schwartz&gt; not sure, but guess would be admin / zenoss</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:32:38] **lavermil&gt; kudos on the guess</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:32:39] **lavermil&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:33:01] **Schwartz&gt;

not very pretty for executive level reports</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:58:04] **Schwartz&gt; I like RRD, you can define how much data you want to keep at what granularity, can stack, area, line, etc etc</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:58:08] **lavermil&gt; openNMS has a nice availability report, it hasn't been updated in a years that is my issue.</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:58:12] **Schwartz&gt; but you're right, it's not a replacement for excel</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 16:58:29] **lavermil&gt;

I was wrong, there are some text based reports.</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 17:09:35] **Schwartz&gt; however, I don't know if zenoss can do something like what we see there.</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 17:09:58] **Schwartz&gt; rrd is good for trending, but it's not great for reports, as granular data is lost rather quickly.</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 17:10:14] **Schwartz&gt; I'm not sure if zenoss can do reports based on the events to generate availability stats</span><br/><span> [16-Mar-2009 17:10:22] **lavermil&gt;

however it only occurs a few times a day</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:20:14] **johns55&gt; could it be polling?</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:20:18] **ke4qqq&gt; remodeling?</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:20:22] **johns55&gt;

how can i find out when zenoss does its remodeling?</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:21:34] **rhett_&gt; are the 50 connections that detrimental to the performance of the box?</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:21:38] **ke4qqq&gt; any zenpacks that are bound to that device?</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:24:46] **johns55&gt; hrm ok i just did a manual remodeling and yes it shows up with a flood of udp connections</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:25:00] **johns55&gt; let me try it on a diff box and see if im getting it in the var/log/messages</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:26:38] **johns55&gt; nope, when i remodel another box it doesnt flood with udp connections</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:26:39] **johns55&gt;

hm maybe</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:28:21] **johns55&gt; however we build our servers all the same</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:28:31] **rhett_&gt; you can also "netstat -ntu | grep -i estab | wc -l" from the cli to see what the connection count is on the boxes you are testing on</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:29:49] **johns55&gt; its a webserver so that wouldnt help much</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:32:03] **rhett_&gt; you serve alot of udp data off your webserver? and if so you could also grep 161</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:32:48] **ke4qqq&gt; johns55: iirc the u in the nestat argument he pasted will limit it to UDP, so it shouldn't see your http traffic</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:33:03] **rhett_&gt; correct</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:35:52] **johns55&gt;

and see if theres a flood of udp connections</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:39:06] **rhett_&gt; lets see</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:43:27] **rhett_&gt; i tail -f /var/log/messags and got about 50 or so lines from my zenoss box</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 13:43:33] **rhett_&gt;

drtns: i can try to help but i cant promise anything</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 14:05:31] **drtns&gt; rhett_ thanks question 1.. If I make an Event Class /MyClass and create a default mapping on that top level that does a transform to change the summary of an SNMP Trap to something more human readable and then I create a sub-organizer /MyClass/Sub1 do the event mappings under /MyClass/Sub1 get the mapping from the parent /MyClass?</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 14:06:08] **rhett_&gt; i believe so but i am uncertain</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 14:06:24] **drtns&gt; because for me it seems like the thing is matching on the first one... doing the transform and then stoping... so I think I need to put that transform in all sub mappings and remove the main parent..</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 14:07:06] **rhett_&gt; hm</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 14:07:17] **rhett_&gt; i dont have anything like that even though i should</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 14:08:17] **rhett_&gt; wish you could just use a cdef on a threshold and report based on cdef isntead of the gauge/counter returned from a device</span><br/><span> [17-Mar-2009 14:10:18] **drtns&gt; rhett_ this is specifically SNMP Traps from one of my network devices... everything is warning...

ah, ok</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:52:09] **raw__&gt; what are you struggling with exactly?</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:52:17] **cico&gt; I will, eventually, since there isn't one for d-link (which is weird..)</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:52:22] **cico&gt; currently, I'm having a Missing RRD File issue</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:52:39] **raw__&gt; d-link isn't really a common brand used by businesses</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:52:59] **raw__&gt; hmmmm, RRD files can take an hour or two to generate</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:53:01] **cico&gt; (piggybacked to the fact that zenoss refuses to load a nicely done MIB file..)</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:53:20] **raw__&gt; erroring out when loading it?</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:53:32] **cico&gt; while I understand that, I do not trust that feedback</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:54:07] **cico&gt; none, but when I try and load the coupled TRAP file, it says it cannot find the relative MIB file..</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:54:26] **raw__&gt; but when you try to load the Mib is fails with no errors messages?</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:54:35] **cico&gt; (regarding rrd:) I fear a permission issue..</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:54:37] **raw__&gt; it* fails, rather</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:55:04] **cico&gt; it does not, but then it won't recognize OIDs</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:55:22] **raw__&gt; then maybe those OIDs aren't included in that particular Mib</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 07:55:55] **raw__&gt; I've never had Zenoss not properly translate OIDs once Mibs were loaded</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:00:08] **cico&gt; if I load it MIBExplorer does not show any tree (anything, actually..)</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:00:31] **raw__&gt; then that'd be your problem</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:00:39] **raw__&gt; it didn't actually load the Mib properly for whatever reason</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:01:41] **cico&gt; but if I click on the top-level name I see OIDs mapped..</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:02:12] **raw__&gt; compare the OIDs that aren't being translated to those OIDs</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:02:22] **raw__&gt; I'll bet you that you won't be able to find them in there</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:03:03] **raw__&gt; what was the name of the Mib that you installed?</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:03:17] **cico&gt; DFL1600-MIB</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:04:02] **raw__&gt; yeh, you're probably missing some of the more basic Mibs</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:04:17] **raw__&gt; you installed the model specific Mibs, there are probably some generic ones that you're missing</span><br/><span><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:04:25] **raw__&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.mibdepot.com/cgi-bin/vendor_index.cgi?r=dlink">http://www.mibdepot.com/cgi-bin/vendor_index.cgi?r=dlink</a></span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:04:40] **adytum-bot&gt;

I believe</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:11:56] **cico&gt; well yes but I wanted to check whether it actually is the correct folder..</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:16:05] **raw__&gt; yeh, the rrd files should all be stored in there</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:47:06] **cain22&gt; i have a question about the google map, and the lines in between locations....</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:49:58] **cain22&gt; why does it sometimes show up(what looks to be)red if i can ping from one device to the other?</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:52:03] **raw__&gt; I believe the red simply indicates that there's some sort of Critical event on one of the devices</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:52:08] **raw__&gt; but I could be wrong</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 08:53:02] **raw__&gt; is anyone from the zenoss dev team around?</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 09:03:14] **cain22&gt; don't think so, because i've seen it be green when both locations were red</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 09:03:21] **raw__&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 09:03:27] **raw__&gt; might be a bug then</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 09:37:57] **cico&gt; erm... let's assume I had a nicely configured graph template..</span><br/><span> [18-Mar-2009 09:38:51] **cico&gt;

nope</span><br/><span> [19-Mar-2009 07:49:05] **raw__&gt; that's only if you write a custom modeler plugin</span><br/><span> [19-Mar-2009 07:50:12] **cico&gt; I mean, I'm still trying to get graphs to work, but I'm not looking into a custom modeler yet (mainly because of doc issues...)</span><br/><span> [19-Mar-2009 07:54:19] **raw__&gt;

thanks</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:20:10] **raw__&gt; seeing as you're on a tight schedule, that might be your best bet</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:20:41] **nobungacat&gt; I'll looki nto the ubuntu server though as I mover forward</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:20:56] **raw__&gt; too bad that you're doing the presentation in 4 hours, there's an official demo of Zenoss Enterprise at 12:00pm EST today (3 hours away) via WebEX hehe</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:21:24] **nobungacat&gt; all I'm trying to do is stop the founders from blowing a crap load of $$ on netcool</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:21:41] **raw__&gt; but yeh, I work in a Noc supporting another companie's clients, but we're currently building our own tools and taking on our own clients, and I'm lead on Zenoss development</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:21:42] **nobungacat&gt; I'd rather have the money for staff in the noc</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:21:56] **raw__&gt; we're sticking with core, not going to pro or enterprise</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:21:58] **raw__&gt; too expensive</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:22:07] **nobungacat&gt; agreed</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:22:27] **nobungacat&gt; sounds like you are doing what this startup is attempting to do</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:22:44] **raw__&gt; too expensive for what you get anyways, I've read up on all the enterprise packs and there's really nothing there that we can't do with open source solutions</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:22:58] **raw__&gt; yeh, we already have Zenoss integrated with a ticketing system</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:23:01] **nobungacat&gt; but I gotta jet.&#160; much work to do.&#160; thanks for the idea on VM</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:23:13] **raw__&gt; so each Zenoss box fires tickets in to the ticketing system for critical events</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:23:17] **nobungacat&gt; I'll drop back in after the presentation and let ya know how it went</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:23:29] **raw__&gt; it's taken us about 4-5 months to get to where we are now</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:23:32] **raw__&gt; k cool</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:23:35] **nobungacat&gt; cya</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:23:38] **raw__&gt; cya</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:48:36] **rocket&gt; raw__: which ticketing system are you using?</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:58:48] **raw__&gt; otrs</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 08:59:01] **raw__&gt; we've modded it quite a bit</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:07:56] **raw__&gt; does anyone know how i'd go about taking a .egg zenpack and installing it in development mode?</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:38:03] **raw__&gt; g'mornin' Matt</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:38:24] **mrayzenoss&gt; good morning</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:40:01] **raw__&gt; by any chance, did you find out what's involved in installing a .egg in development mode? I sent an email to cgibbons as well since he seemed to know how to do it one time I was talking to him.</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:40:26] **mrayzenoss&gt; ok, I'll see what I can dig up</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:40:50] **raw__&gt; thanks, it'd be greatly appreciated, it's a roadblock for me right now</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:41:19] **raw__&gt; I finally figured out how to automatically assign templates for different interface types, pretty cool</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:42:08] **mrayzenoss&gt; cool, I think one of the HP ones does that</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:42:18] **mrayzenoss&gt; when it models, it determines which template?</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:42:34] **raw__&gt; well, I mean, just by naming the template under /Devices as the interface type</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:42:45] **mrayzenoss&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:43:25] **raw__&gt; like ethernetCsmacd for Ethernet, frame-relay for Serial, ds1 for T1 Controllers, etc...</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:44:08] **raw__&gt; before I found that out it was applying the ethernet template to every interface, and I was trying to figure out how to remove it and apply a different template lol</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:45:19] **davetoo1&gt; I sent my zenoss to the twilight zone</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:45:29] **raw__&gt; lol, how'd you manage that?</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:46:03] **davetoo1&gt; trying to develop a zenpack</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:46:25] **raw__&gt; and by twilight zone what do you mean?</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:46:32] **raw__&gt; what is your malfunction?</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:46:47] **davetoo1&gt;&#160; are you on the zenoss-users list?</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:46:54] **raw__&gt; I believe so</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:47:00] **raw__&gt; maybe not</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:47:12] **davetoo1&gt; hang on, let me get the link</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:47:16] **raw__&gt;

I thought the upgrade process (to 2.3.3) might fix it by reloading the models, but hasn't helped</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:49:29] **raw__&gt; but no idea, kind of beyond my league at this point</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 09:49:43] **raw__&gt;

I guess there is really no reason to touch this?</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:23:14] **mrayzenoss&gt; ke4qqq: sorry I was at lunch. Yes, the Deki/Zenoss mashup ties them together so you can keep notes on your devices</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:23:29] **raw__&gt; yeh, anything that's not in /usr/local/zenoss/zenoss has different permissions</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:23:34] **raw__&gt;

I haven't seen it either.&#160; It came in via mailman, but didn't get cross-posted</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:35:38] **mrayzenoss&gt; let me bug the sysadmin about it</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:35:53] **mrayzenoss&gt; sometimes the mail2forum bridge is buggy, but we haven't seen that much lately</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:37:43] **mrayzenoss&gt; rocket: it just showed up</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:37:44] **rocket&gt; ok I reposted it on the forum</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:37:56] **mrayzenoss&gt; oh, nertz</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:38:05] **rocket&gt; mrayzenoss: that was me posting directly to the forum :/</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:38:17] **rocket&gt;

heh, the post just came across</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:49:29] **mrayzenoss&gt; so now it's double-posted</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:49:42] **mrayzenoss&gt; 2 hours... doh</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:49:46] **rocket&gt; ok I will probably just delete the forum post?</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:50:32] **mrayzenoss&gt; either one, let me know which is left and I'll post it to the developers</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:50:38] **rocket&gt; ok I deleted the forum post</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:50:45] **mrayzenoss&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:50:49] **rocket&gt; the email one is still there</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:51:43] **mrayzenoss&gt; ok, all the developers are in a UI meeting</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:53:24] **mrayzenoss&gt; perr0: you asked about the UI updates?</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:55:05] **davetoo&gt; I need to figure out how my zenpack development broke my system </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:55:30] **perr0&gt; mrayzenoss: I was jus wondering when we should see the new gui and will it be included in core</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:56:17] **mrayzenoss&gt; so the short answer is most of the UI changes are going into King Crab, the next release</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:56:29] **mrayzenoss&gt; Blue Crab has upgraded all the underlying libraries</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:56:42] **mrayzenoss&gt; and added the job scheduler and the setup wizard</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:57:12] **mrayzenoss&gt; but because of the reduced size of development, the major overhauls got postponed a bit</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:57:50] **mrayzenoss&gt; and we're still meeting with an external UI consultant to redesign much of the appearance</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 12:58:04] **mrayzenoss&gt; with a major focus on usability</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:02:14] **perr0&gt; mrayzenoss: thanks for the update, now sorry I don't keep up with the seafood order you have going on.. so in the final release of 2.4 is when we should see the initial change</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:04:31] **davetoo&gt; mrayzenoss: I can never guess if what I'm looking for in a device should be under the Edit tab or under zProperties</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:04:41] **davetoo&gt; and I've read a lot of the code</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:04:44] **davetoo&gt; confuses my users greatly</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:07:08] charlieS_ is now known as charlieS</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:07:43] **mrayzenoss&gt; perr0: the libraries and wizard are in the 2.4 beta, there are still a few more things going into the next beta drop</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:08:39] **mrayzenoss&gt; davetoo: yeah, that can be confusing.</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:09:59] **mrayzenoss&gt; Typically the Edit tab is for things directly related to that device, while zProperties are at the Device Class</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:10:07] **perr0&gt; k</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:10:11] **mrayzenoss&gt; but of course, you can set zProperties on the individual device</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:10:32] **rocket&gt; mrayzenoss: ok I think I figured it out</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:12:23] **rocket&gt; if the product key has more than one line it doesnt match</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:12:41] **rocket&gt; it almost looks like more of a ui inconsistency perhaps</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:13:51] **rocket&gt; the ui in /Manufacturers/ shows product key</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:14:21] **rocket&gt; if you enter more than one line in there it looks like ".1.2.3.4.5,new_item_added"</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:14:53] **rocket&gt; and as soon as you add the new item the search function looks at that as a whole and doesnt think it matches ".1.2.3.4.5"</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:15:26] **rocket&gt; so if there are any differences at all in the product key field compared to the oid we are looking for it creates a new product</span><br/><span> [25-Mar-2009 13:20:24] **rocket&gt;

same goes for all the other Community ZenPacks</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 13:22:10] **raw__&gt; ok, well, here's what I did...</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 13:22:12] **mrayzenoss_&gt; it makes the setup.py when it's in Development Mode before you export it</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 13:22:52] **raw__&gt;

other than keeping the zenpack source outside of the $ZENHOME directory?</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 13:34:55] **raw__&gt; yup, my custom setup.py worked like a charm</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 13:34:56] **raw__&gt;

just grab the ZenPacks individually and install them</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:46:33] **perr0&gt; I am on el5 suppose there is no other way... ok</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:47:08] **mrayzenoss_&gt; well you can install the core-zenpacks.rpm which adds all of them, or you can add the ZenPacks that you actually need individually</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:47:40] **mrayzenoss_&gt; I find most people just use 1 or 2 if any of those</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:48:40] **perr0&gt; mrayzenoss_: sorry to ask such elementary question to install an rpm zenpack is zenpack --install 88zenapck** right?</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:48:46] **mrayzenoss_&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:48:51] **mrayzenoss_&gt; or do it through the UI</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:49:48] **perr0&gt; how often do you guys upgrade the zenpacks now that you have 2.3.3 out?</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:50:05] **mrayzenoss_&gt; the Core ZenPacks rarely change</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:50:20] **mrayzenoss_&gt; they're pretty simple</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:50:36] **mrayzenoss_&gt; the only new one for 2.4 is the LinuxMonitor</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:50:45] **perr0&gt; they're for lazy admins like me</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:51:23] **mrayzenoss_&gt; surprisingly a fair number of installs don't use any ZenPacks</span><br/><span> [27-Mar-2009 14:53:30] **perr0&gt; mrayzenoss_: I did quite a bit of reaserch on monitoring openLDAP and I understand it would be a task to attemp this.

whatever you want</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:26:17] **raw__&gt; nice, devs</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:26:23] **raw__&gt; I'll certainly be here </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:26:41] **raw__&gt; last time you had one of those I was sick</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:27:02] **mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, I missed the session over Spring Break.&#160; I was on vacation</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:27:25] **raw__&gt; what is generally discussed?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:27:33] **raw__&gt; or is it just open forum?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:27:37] **mrayzenoss&gt; open forum</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:27:40] **raw__&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:27:50] **mrayzenoss&gt; it's just a heads-up that there will definitely be me and at least 1 developer</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:27:58] **raw__&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:28:06] **raw__&gt; you're always here though</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:28:07] **raw__&gt; </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:28:23] **mrayzenoss&gt;

thanks!</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:29:13] **philm&gt; While there is activity here, I shall ask this question again - does Zenoss monitor BGP peers on Cisco routers?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:30:43] **mrayzenoss&gt; nope</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:31:04] **philm&gt; Bummer.&#160; Is there a plug in to do so?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:31:50] **Schwartz&gt; is there a cisco mib that exports specific BGP information? flaps? routes added/removed?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:32:02] **Schwartz&gt; could probably just add in a couple new data sources in the template</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:32:30] **philm&gt; I'm pretty much just after flaps. I dont want to know about roues added/removed - as that wil just kill us, having all the routes in the world being picked up</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:33:57] **mrayzenoss&gt; do those get exposed via SNMP?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:33:59] **Schwartz&gt; I would recommend just doing an snmp walk (including the cisco bgp mib so you get mib name resolution) and pick out anything that looks like flap counter</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:34:00] **mrayzenoss&gt; or traps?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:34:10] **philm&gt; Yes, they do</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:34:31] **mrayzenoss&gt; so you could watch for the traps or monitor the OID</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:34:33] **philm&gt; I have the Cisco mibs pack, doesn't seem to be picking up BGP though</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:34:43] **mrayzenoss&gt; the mibs aren't very useful</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:34:58] **mrayzenoss&gt; Zenoss only uses them for translating traps to English</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:35:07] **mrayzenoss&gt; nothing magical about them</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:35:17] **philm&gt; Yeah, but saves me doing them though!</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:35:22] **mrayzenoss&gt; true</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:35:36] **mrayzenoss&gt; I'm just saying, there's a misconception that they're used in active monitoring</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:35:53] **mrayzenoss&gt; the mib browser lets you dig through them, that's nice</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:36:23] **philm&gt; So I just need to find the snmp traps that the routers send when bgp goes down, and make an event class for that?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:36:29] **mrayzenoss&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:36:37] **philm&gt; Ok, I'll look into that later today</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:37:09] **philm&gt; 2nd question, for alerts which are high, can they be persistent until someone acknowledges them? Instead of them disapearing when it fixes itself?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:37:24] **mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, just remove the clear event</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:37:45] **philm&gt; I want zenoss to keep bugging me for some things, so it wakes people up who are on call to check what actually happened</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:37:52] **philm&gt; Where/how do I do that?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:39:55] **mrayzenoss&gt; in the Event, there's a zProperties tab</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:40:06] **mrayzenoss&gt; it lists a zEventClearClasses, remove those</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:41:05] **philm&gt; ok, ta</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:42:02] **philm&gt; 3rd and final question. Zenomodeller keeps failing heartbeat - what would be the cause of this? I can't see anything in log files. I did die previously because of lack of ram, so I've chucked another 1GB of ram on the virtual host, so that has semi fixed it. Ram usage sits under 70% now</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:42:36] **mrayzenoss&gt; is it timing out?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:44:20] **philm&gt; What do you mean?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:44:57] **Schwartz&gt; if it just won't clear, go to the host and clear all heart beats, that'll usually reset things</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 17:45:34] **mrayzenoss&gt; gotta go, be back tomorrow</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 18:04:21] **philm&gt; I need to work out why it keeps dying. Appears the box is back to 100% memory use. It has 2GB! How much ram does Zenoss need? That seems like a lot</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 18:04:29] **ironpaw&gt; morning poeple</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 18:05:15] **ironpaw&gt; can anyone recommend a basic how to in regards to the initial monitoring of devices? I'm having a hard time getting it sorted</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 18:05:21] **ironpaw&gt; maybe its cos im a bit slow</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 18:13:00] KingJ is now known as kingj</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 19:05:47] **sergeymasushko&gt; how does zenoss model ports on cisco devices?</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 19:43:23] **raw__&gt; sergeymasushko :&#160; via SNMP</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 19:45:58] **raw__&gt; if you do an snmpwalk on a cisco device you'll see the interface info early on</span><br/><span> [31-Mar-2009 19:46:58] **sergeymasushko&gt; ok.
