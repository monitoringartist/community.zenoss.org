good morning</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:46:53] &lt;jb&gt; good morning </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:48:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; can anyone think of a way to allow regular users to execute 1 command only as Zenoss user?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:49:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it has to apply to all users, not just specific ones</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:49:29] &lt;jb&gt; through a shell on the server?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:49:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:49:38] &lt;jb&gt; sudo?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:50:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have sudo installed, no idea how I'd go about doing this though</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:50:18] &lt;jb&gt; you need to configure access in /etc/sudoers</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:50:24] &lt;jb&gt; look at the man page</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:50:36] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: it is pretty simple if you read the man page for sudo .. using the command visudo to edit the sudoers file</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:50:46] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: basically you put all the users in a group</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:50:59] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: assign the group the privledges you need</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:51:15] &lt;rocket&gt; by group I mean system group</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:51:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I could specify the users group for instance?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:51:21] &lt;rocket&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:52:47] &lt;rocket&gt; system groups (prefixed with '%')</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:53:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; does that allow me to specify access to a specific command?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:53:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; or would everyone effectively have zenoss level access?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:53:40] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: you then specify the command</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:53:59] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: that is just the user specification you are defining that has access to that command</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:54:23] &lt;jb&gt; read the man page </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><span> there are also examples in sudoers</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:54:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm reading the man page, it's a long manpage </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:54:44] &lt;jb&gt; look at sudoers..</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:55:05] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: or hire a consultant </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><span> .. for the most part this is pretty basic stuff </span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:55:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm aware that this is basic stuff</span><br/><span><span> [01-May-2009 09:55:48] &lt;rocket&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.afp548.com/article.php?story=20051025103428232">http://www.afp548.com/article.php?story=20051025103428232</a></span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:55:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just haven't had much experience with sudo other than simply granting full access to whoever</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:55:59] &lt;adytum-bot&gt; Title: AFP548 - Essential Sudoers (at www.afp548.com)</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:56:32] &lt;rocket&gt; found via a google search "sudoers group file access"</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:57:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; depending on your platform, there may be a man page for just the conf file</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:57:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket :&#160; thanks, exactly what I need</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:57:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that said, I can't reach my Debian box to check</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:57:59] &lt;rocket&gt; eg man sudoers</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:58:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:58:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; root@gen01:/home/rmatte# man sudoers.conf</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:58:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; No manual entry for sudoers.conf</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:58:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:58:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; that works</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:59:38] &lt;jb&gt; does zen do anything special for XEN?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 09:59:50] &lt;jb&gt; i'll probably just add dom0 and the domU's as separate devices</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:00:02] &lt;jb&gt; there is no .conf</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:00:04] &lt;jb&gt; its just /etc/sudoers</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:00:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; there's an Enterprise ZenPack for monitoring Xen</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:00:21] &lt;jb&gt; oh yeah?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:00:21] &lt;jb&gt; hm</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:00:24] &lt;jb&gt; i'll check it out</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:02:48] &lt;rocket&gt; mrayzenoss: ping .. is chet around I have a quick 5 minute question to ask him regarding relationships</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:03:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I pinged him, I'll let you know</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:03:36] &lt;rocket&gt; Thanks </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:04:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

You have VG and PV.. then what?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:17:23] &lt;jb&gt; LV</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:17:33] &lt;jb&gt; then filesystem </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:17:50] &lt;rocket&gt; techically hdisk -&gt; physical_volume(software_created) -&gt; volume_group -&gt; logical_volume -&gt; filesystem</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:18:40] &lt;rocket&gt; even more technical lun-&gt; lun_id -&gt; vio -&gt; vio_mapping -&gt; hdisk .. </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:19:34] &lt;cluther&gt; hmm.. I don't know if this is a good map.</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:20:01] &lt;cluther&gt; What if you started with VG had two relations on it: PV and LV.</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:20:11] &lt;cluther&gt; Then PV had HD and LV had FS.</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:20:18] &lt;rocket&gt; cluther: that is the other way I was thinking</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:20:58] &lt;cluther&gt; This would keep you from having to create a lot of non-containing relations. You want to avoid those if you can since they're harder to maintain.</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:24:19] &lt;rocket&gt; so I am still a bit foggy on the difference between a containing rel and non-containing rel ..</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:26:02] &lt;cluther&gt; rocket: Oh yeah.. it's really quite simple. Every object in Zope must have a single primary path where it lives. A containing relation means that the objects contained within live HERE, and if they're deleted from this relation they are gone for good. A non-containing relation is a way to relate to other objects without making them live underneath you.</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:26:25] &lt;cluther&gt; So a device is contained within a DeviceClass, but it is not contained within a Location.</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:26:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was told that I could use d.getStatus("/") to get device status, but it always seems to show up as "0", even when a device is actually down</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:27:28] &lt;rocket&gt; cluther: I see ..</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:27:51] &lt;cluther&gt; rmatte: That is the appropriate call for a component, but no a device unfortunately.</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:27:58] &lt;cluther&gt; rmatte: Just use d.getStatus() instead.</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:28:37] &lt;rocket&gt; cluther: would a non containing relation be a way to link say a HardwareManagementConsole to say the physical machine it controls?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:29:05] &lt;rocket&gt; so if I delete the HMC the physical machine information isnt lost</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:29:16] &lt;rocket&gt; or it moves from one hmc to another for example?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:29:27] &lt;cluther&gt; rocket: yeah</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:30:33] &lt;rocket&gt; cluther: so I would have to call manage_addDevice(physical_machine) from my hmc then?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:31:06] &lt;rocket&gt; like I am doing with my components basically .. but its not a containing relationship .. I think I got it ..</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:36:14] &lt;rocket&gt; cluther: thanks! </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:47:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; cluther :&#160; ah, thanks</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:48:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so now I have a bunch of zeros and a number (3909)</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:49:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; any way to interpret these?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:49:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; like, what would be Down and what would be Up?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:49:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just basically want to dump straight up/down status on devices</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:55:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, all I can get is the number of events?</span><br/><span> [01-May-2009 10:57:32] &lt;cluther&gt; Right.

ummm, it outputs it like 1233853473.81</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 10:53:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; any way to format that in to a regular date?</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 10:55:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; (a quick way I mean, without me having to write some big procedure)</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 10:56:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; because time.time() simply returns the time in seconds since the epoch UTC</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 10:59:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, that doesn't work at all</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 10:59:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; that only shows the time since the last actual reboot</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 10:59:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; not since the last time the node became unreachable</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 10:59:40] &lt;cluther&gt; Doh.. true.</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 10:59:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; like, what if a network circuit goes down and we lose connectivity, that's the time/date we want to see</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 11:00:07] &lt;cluther&gt; We'd need some kind of method to find the last ping down event in history.</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 11:00:14] &lt;cluther&gt; That doesn't currently exist</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 11:00:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; crappy</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 11:00:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh well</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 11:24:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; or have some method to set some sort of zope value each time the device is either ping up or ping down</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 11:24:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; would come in handy</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 11:56:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; does Zenoss gather it's uptime info based on the sysUpTime datapoint in Device templates?</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 11:56:22] &lt;rmatte&gt;

if you go to the Perf tab do you have updated graphs?</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 13:25:04] &lt;AngryParsley&gt; ooh. if I go to localhost's perf tab and look at graphs, collected events drops to 0 on 4/11</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 13:25:11] &lt;AngryParsley&gt;

then you need to add the actual class to the zenpack instead of just the report</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 15:04:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then remove any reports from that class in the zenpack that you don't want</span><br/><span> [04-May-2009 15:04:24] &lt;jb&gt;

ah ok</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 08:57:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; strange that it would just suddenly change like that</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 08:58:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; that Windows SNMP agent is a wacky thing</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 08:59:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, none of the processes currently being monitored via SNMP show any CPU or memory utilization info...</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:00:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; Matt pointed me to a paper by Jane on process monitoring, I read through but it doesn't really have anything that helps me with this issue</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:00:31] &lt;cluther&gt; rmatte: What version are you running again?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:00:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; latest stable version</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:00:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2.3.3 I think?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:00:53] * rmatte checks</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:01:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup, 2.3.3</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:01:45] &lt;cluther&gt; rmatte: Do you know that the up/down monitoring of processes is working?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:02:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; not really sure actually</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:02:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; they show as up</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:02:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; haven't really seen any alerts for any going down</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:02:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; something we need to test today I guess</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:02:42] &lt;cluther&gt; rmatte: You could try running "zenprocess run" to see if it runs properly or if there are any errors.</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:03:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll try that right now...</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:03:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, I need why the interface info changed, they added another NIC</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:03:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see why*</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:03:58] &lt;jb&gt; 2.4 out today </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:04:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, firing off zenprocess...</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:04:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2.4 is officially released today?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:04:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; or just next beta?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:04:21] &lt;jb&gt; 2.4 core</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:04:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:04:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll upgrade our Lab box then later and make sure that everything goes smoothly</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:10:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't seen any 2.4 download links up on the site yet</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:10:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; is the release a bit later on?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:12:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; ummmmm</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:12:41] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Then run zenprocess again and see if the results differ.</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:15:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:15:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; just need to finish modelling these 2 other servers then I'll try it out</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:16:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; So does that reindex everything then commit it back to zope?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:17:54] &lt;cluther&gt; Right. I'm thinking that the processes got set to monitored, but this was no reflected in the catalog.</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:18:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:18:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; does this sort of thing happen often?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:18:18] &lt;cluther&gt; We've had a couple of tickets surrounding this problem. If we can confirm it then we at least know that it is fixed in 2.4.</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:18:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; might be a nice feature to have right in the UI</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:18:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; something like Manage -&gt; Reindex &amp; Commit</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:18:48] &lt;jmp242&gt; anyone know if there's a reason Zenoss 2.3.3 might mount home directories beyond it's own?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:19:02] &lt;cluther&gt; rmatte: It's really a band-aid. Our general feeling is that we'd rather know about the problems than run some process to silently fix them.</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:19:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, you fixed this sort of thing in 2.4, nice</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:19:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, true enough</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:20:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; "mount home directories"?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:20:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; explain/</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:20:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; == ?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:21:48] &lt;rocket&gt; cluther: if I have a modeler returns results missing columns does that mean I am trying to get too many snmp vars at once?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:22:03] &lt;jmp242&gt; oh, somehow our Zenoss Server has mounted all of our users home directories from the home directory server via NFS</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:22:18] &lt;jmp242&gt; we're trying to track down perhaps why this has happened</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:22:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wasn't even aware that Zenoss contained the functionality to mount an nfs share</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:22:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; you sure it's not some script that you whipped together gone haywire?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:23:34] &lt;rocket&gt; have an automount running perhaps jmp242? and somehow touched the wrong directories?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:23:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that could be it as well</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:26:07] &lt;jmp242&gt; well, I haven't written any scripts to hit odd directories that I'm aware of ... but I'm trying to narrow this down... Has anyone had it stop looking at the zFileSystemMapIgnoreNames?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:26:41] &lt;jmp242&gt; I think it recently (maybe after our upgrade from 2.2.4 to 2.3.3) started erroring on /AFS directories</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:26:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; only when I made a syntax error/spelling mistake</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:27:05] &lt;jmp242&gt; but this is our entry:</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:27:09] &lt;jmp242&gt; mm</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:27:18] &lt;jmp242&gt; this:&#160; /nfs/|/cdat/|/a/|/afs/|/home/</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:29:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, maybe you have to do something to make the /home one apply recursively?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:30:14] &lt;jmp242&gt; mmm</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:31:24] &lt;jmp242&gt; What's weird is we aren't seeing /home events or filesystems in the OS tab. Odder is we are seeing /afs though</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:32:01] &lt;jmp242&gt; and it's giving: /afs &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;8.6GB&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;79.6GB&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;-71.0GB&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;927</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:32:20] &lt;jmp242&gt; so somehow a negative free space</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:32:39] &lt;jmp242&gt; would a re-model maybe get rid of the spurious /afs monitoring?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:36:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; it might</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:36:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; The ignore lines require remodels</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:36:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you add an ignore but don't remodel it does nothing</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:38:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; big Zenpacks seem to make zProperties take forever to load/save, might be something to look in to fixing for King Crab</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:39:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; and by big I mean huge (Cisco Mibs pack)</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:39:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's like it has to reindex all zenpacks before it'll load zProperties</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:39:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; same thing for actually loading the Zenpacks page</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:53:53] &lt;jmp242&gt; so this is really weird</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:56:10] &lt;jmp242&gt; if I change my zFileSystemMapIgnoreNames</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:56:19] &lt;jmp242&gt; to be : /nfs/|/cdat/|/a/|/afs|/home/</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:56:32] &lt;jmp242&gt; now it does what I expect, and doesn't monitor /afs/</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:57:03] &lt;jmp242&gt; but regex of /afs/ should match /afs/ just like /afs matches /afs/ ...</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:57:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; you might not even need the trailing /'s</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:57:34] &lt;jmp242&gt; well, we do sort of, because there could be /afserl/ or something else in the future</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:57:53] &lt;jmp242&gt; we are more worried because we currently have /a/ in there</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:57:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, technically "/afs" refers to the directory itself while "/afs/" refers more to the contents of the directory, maybe Zenoss is just quirky like that</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:57:56] &lt;jmp242&gt; and that is working</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:58:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe it's a combination of the s and the /?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:58:26] &lt;jmp242&gt; mmm</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:58:39] &lt;jmp242&gt; I wonder if the back end parsing changed between 2.2.4 and 2.3.3</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:58:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; is /nfs/ working?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:58:44] &lt;jmp242&gt; seems to be</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:58:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's possible</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:58:48] &lt;jmp242&gt; which is why this is so weird</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 09:58:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:05:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; too bad you guys don't have a "Zenoss Merchandise" section on your site, I want a Zenny Zebra for my desk lol</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:09:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: heh, those are like 10 cents each, we give away a couple hundred at every conference</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:09:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we'll be at SouthEast Linux Fest next month</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:10:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've seen the photos, but I can't really make any of the conferences unless you guys come out to BSD Can next year</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:11:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ahh, this weekend</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:11:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:11:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kinda short notice </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:11:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:11:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's why I said, next year</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:12:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hopefully we'll have real ports next year</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:12:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's something to look at, Ottawa is one of the biggest IT cities in Canada</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:12:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; would be nice to see you guys up here hehe</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:13:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; now to see if this reindexing that Chet suggested actually works...</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:15:27] &lt;jb&gt; i have a couple of zebras on my desk</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:15:27] &lt;jb&gt;

not sure where you are located..</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:16:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; maybe we should send Ian, he's in Waterloo</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:16:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, Waterloo isn't far</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:16:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it sort of is, but not that bad hehe</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:16:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; closer than Kells, he's in Calgary</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:17:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, there's no way I can make Chicago, especially since I don't currently have a passport</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:17:12] &lt;jmp242&gt; mmm, is there another better way to disable monitoring of just /afs/ than the zFileSystemMapIgnoreNames ...?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:17:12] &lt;chudler&gt; What's Zenoss doing in Chicago?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:17:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool, didn't know you guys had people all over the place like that</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:17:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; thought you were all in the US</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:17:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; CAMP IT</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:17:26] &lt;jb&gt; chudler: CAMPIT </span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:17:32] &lt;jb&gt; im going..</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:17:41] &lt;jb&gt; its like 10minutes from my office</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:17:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; jb: nice</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:17:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; cool, I don't know who's going, I figure it's an Enterprise thing</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:18:10] &lt;jb&gt; yeah its gary myk</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:18:13] &lt;jb&gt; and dahl is speaking</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:19:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; someone from Ottawa Linux Symposium did stop by at LinuxFest NW.&#160; Said we should go</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:20:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:20:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; we have quite a few of things like that here</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:20:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; heh, looking at the business card now, it was Ontario LinuxFest</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:20:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I used to be a heavy FreeBSD user, so that's why I caught on to BSDCan, but I also occasionally go to some Linux related events as well</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:21:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, I always see the same FreeBSD people at the Linux conventions</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:21:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I haven't used FreeBSD in like 3 years, but I used it for like 5 years before I even touched Linux, so I still remember all the intricacies of it</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:22:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I also dabbled with NetBSD and OpenBSD</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:23:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; fun fun</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:23:06] &lt;jb&gt; i used to be a fbsd junkie</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:23:12] &lt;jb&gt;

migrated my FreeBSD server to Gentoo about 3 years ago</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:23:52] &lt;jb&gt; well, i run windows on my desktop stuff.. and we have a fairly large AD infrastructure here as well</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:23:55] &lt;jb&gt; so i dabble in lots</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:24:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, I run Linux on my desktop at work, but I have a Windows virtual machine for Microsoft CRM, Exchange, etc...</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:24:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; wow, now Zenprocess is picking everything up</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:24:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; thanks Chet, it was the index</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:24:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; INFO:zen.zenprocess:Pulled process status for 47 devices and 146 processes</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:24:54] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I sure will</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:30:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; wow</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:30:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; got a huuuuuge flood of process down notifications</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:30:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; hopefully that's only temporary</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:36:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; the guys working in our ticketing system were like "ok, why do we suddenly have 75 tickets in the stack?"</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:42:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so now I have a process count graph for processes, but no CPU or Memory graphs, guess they'll just take some time to generate</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:45:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok, they are showing up for some processes</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:46:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, those were my Zenoss issues for the day, all solved</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:46:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; thanks Chet</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:47:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; Hey Matt, what's the official time of release for 2.4?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:47:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; today</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:47:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:47:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but at noon, or what?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:47:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I still see 2.3.3 listed on the site</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:48:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we're doing a release check of everything right now</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:48:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; everything uploaded, new docs, checking URLs</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:49:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and I'm doing the Getting Started with Zenoss webinar right now</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:49:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:50:15] &lt;jb&gt; wheres that?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:50:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; those weminars are fairly basic right?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:50:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; like, I probably wouldn't get much out of it?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:50:36] &lt;jb&gt; dountful</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:50:40] &lt;jb&gt; doubtful</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:50:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, we basically walk through the installation and Getting Started with Zenoss Guides</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:51:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; is there any kind of more advanced weminar explaining creation of collector plugins, or stuff like that?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:51:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; even if I had to pay for it lol</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:51:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; not yet, we just started doing them</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:51:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:51:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; would be cool though</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:51:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; but that would be a good idea.&#160; I bet there would be interest</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:52:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, instead of a quick weminar you could basically offer remote training courses</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:52:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; a couple hours a day for a week or whatever</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:52:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, we have video conferencing equipment, we could probably pull that off</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:53:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:53:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we've got a linkup between Austin &amp; Annapolis, and the remote devs can login as well. Seems like it should work for training</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:53:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; for sure</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:54:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; what do you guys actually use for the webinars?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:54:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; something like WebEX I'd assume?</span><br/><span><span> [05-May-2009 10:55:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://forms.zenoss.com/weekly-demo">http://forms.zenoss.com/weekly-demo</a></span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:55:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's a webex</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:55:23] &lt;adytum-bot&gt; Title: Zenoss Weekly Demo (at forms.zenoss.com)</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:55:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok, I'd need to view it on a windows box then</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:55:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:56:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I think it works with Linux, I seem to remember using it before (I'm currently on OSX)</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:56:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, I've had no luck with using Webex in Linux, but I'll give it a go to see..</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:57:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, too late to get in to today's</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 10:57:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless you actually send me a direct link hehe</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:00:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; just register and it should send you the link</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:00:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; it only offers the webinar for tomorrow</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:00:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; tomorrow?</span><br/><span><span> [05-May-2009 11:00:26] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://forms.zenoss.com/getting-started">http://forms.zenoss.com/getting-started</a></span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:00:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; try that</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:00:38] &lt;adytum-bot&gt; Title: Getting Started with Zenoss (at forms.zenoss.com)</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:00:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, probably because it was the weekly-demo link you sent me before</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:00:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; oops</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:03:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, your webex is way better than what we were using</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:03:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; since it seems to work in any browser</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:05:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:05:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; where is this elusive request button for a dial in number...</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:06:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah found it</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:33:52] &lt;perr0&gt; mrayzenoss: are you taking questions for the webez?</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:33:55] &lt;perr0&gt; x</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:34:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; he's taking QA in the webex session itself</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:34:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; join the session and click on the Q&amp;A tab</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:34:28] &lt;perr0&gt; ahh, thanks</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:34:30] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; perr0: yeah</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:34:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span><span> [05-May-2009 11:35:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh Matt, if you want to bedazzle them with a zenoss map you can have Chet show them: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dmon.org/graphics/zenoss.png">http://dmon.org/graphics/zenoss.png</a></span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:35:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:35:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; (google map)</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:35:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: email me that, I'll throw it up on our Flickr</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:35:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; will do</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 11:38:41] &lt;perr0&gt; rmatte: nice</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 12:52:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; the webinar was nice, I really didn't get anything out of it, but nice to see the sort of setup you guys have</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 12:55:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 13:25:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, this is ridiculous</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 13:25:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; we're getting flooded with process monitor failures all of a sudden</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 13:27:32] &lt;MACscr1&gt; So how can I setup a dynamic value for memAvailSwap?

like, I had to create a ton of different templates for monitoring different numbers of CPUs, in many different OID configurations</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 20:20:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; but when I want to change CPU thresholds I have to go and find every single local template and update it by hand</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 20:20:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; where as, if it inherited values from a parent template it'd be perfect</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 20:20:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; could update it all in one spot and save boatloads of time</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 20:21:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; same with interface templates and such</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 20:22:55] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; sure, it would be helpful too.</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 22:20:47] MACscr1 is now known as MACscr</span><br/><span> [05-May-2009 23:38:31] &lt;DrX&gt;

Try zport or zport/dmd.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:40:08] &lt;__ian__&gt; rocket: In what context? That is, what do you mean by "link"?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:40:35] &lt;rocket&gt; eg --- hmc &lt;-link-&gt; server1</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:40:48] &lt;rocket&gt; eg --- hmc &lt;-link-&gt; server2</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:40:50] &lt;__ian__&gt; no, I get that...what I mean is, what is your end goal?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:41:12] &lt;rocket&gt; eg I want to be able to go to the hmc ... and make a page that shows the different servers</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:41:17] &lt;__ian__&gt; A UI anchor tag? Or some low-level relationship for a new feature?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:41:32] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; but I tried it before upgrade and it works </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:41:32] &lt;__ian__&gt; Yeah, that &lt;link&gt; element is not how you would do that.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:42:02] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: I am not sure yet I guess .. I might want to pull some server stat into the hmc webpage .. but initially probably not ..</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:42:16] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: a UI anchor tag is probably all I would need initially</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:42:17] &lt;__ian__&gt; rocket: The hmc will presumably have some reference to the servers -- IP, hostname, something. You make a template that looks those up.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:43:00] &lt;__ian__&gt; That is, that takes the string referring to the server and basically finds the related Device object in the database, and makes an anchor tag pointing there.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:43:42] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: but then from a device perspective there is no real link .. ?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:44:49] &lt;__ian__&gt; Oh, I see what you are saying. You want to pull zenoss content into the hmc? I somehow glossed over that.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:46:01] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: eg hmc goes down .. I may not wish to get alerts about the systems going down .. (bad example ... but thats kind of the thought )</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:46:07] &lt;__ian__&gt; The &lt;link&gt; element is just output from the device dump. It's a way for the XML to refer to other objects in the Zope database without redefining them. It is in no way related to anything user-facing.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:46:33] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: ok .. so I would have to do a relationship then ..</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:46:48] &lt;__ian__&gt; Well, not necessarily. It can be dynamic.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:46:50] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: probably a one-to-one non container relationship?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:47:13] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: oh? howso? </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:47:48] &lt;__ian__&gt; so...the HMC is a Device in Zenoss, right?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:47:55] &lt;rocket&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:48:12] &lt;rocket&gt; its standalone .. but it knows about the servers</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:48:12] &lt;__ian__&gt; and it models, and gets back...what, a list of strings referring to servers?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:48:25] &lt;rocket&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:49:02] &lt;__ian__&gt; So if you have that list stored as an attribute of the object, you can build your template to iterate over the list and do a catalog lookup</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:50:32] &lt;__ian__&gt; &lt;tal:block tal:repeat="server here/listOfHostnames"&gt;&lt;a tal:attributes="href python:here.dmd.Devices.findDevice(server).absolute_url_path()"&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/tal:block&gt;</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:50:37] &lt;__ian__&gt; something like that.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:50:43] &lt;__ian__&gt; make sense?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:50:49] &lt;rocket&gt; ok thats kind of what I thought ..</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:50:54] &lt;rocket&gt; it does ..</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:51:07] &lt;__ian__&gt; A more formal relationship gets you into difficulty</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:51:18] &lt;__ian__&gt; because then you have to keep the relationships synced on every model</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:51:23] &lt;rocket&gt; I am assuming deleting it is a pain etc ..</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:51:27] &lt;__ian__&gt; whereas if it's just a list of strings that isn't needed.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:52:35] &lt;__ian__&gt; Your dependency scenario is more difficult, and then you would probably need some relatively complex setup</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:53:51] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: would it ever make sense from a event monitoring perspective to link them via a dependancy?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:54:21] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: another example .. a cisco fiber switch port and a server</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:55:10] &lt;rocket&gt; eg if the port goes down .. dont alert on the server port failure .. something along those lines .. or would that be handled better in a transform?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:55:50] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: I am just trying to understand how to best handle these dependancies as I am programming things so I have less work in the long run with the other admins or users using it</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:56:08] &lt;__ian__&gt; A transform is the easiest way, certainly.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:57:07] &lt;__ian__&gt; Creating and maintaining actual relationships between objects is a huge deal. Our Enterprise VMWare pack has to do that between hosts and guests.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:58:02] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: well my hmc might need to be a similar model... or a vio and lpar relationship etc ..</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:58:55] &lt;rocket&gt; eg an aix system can have a &lt;server_frame&gt; -&gt; &lt;virtual_io server&gt; -&gt; &lt;lpar/real_server&gt;</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:59:19] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: and that probably needs to be handled similarly to an enterprise vmware pack</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:59:29] &lt;__ian__&gt; rocket: Exactly. You'd need to write custom classes for those things, to handle relationships back and forth, and find a sane way to keep those updated on remodel.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:59:42] &lt;__ian__&gt; rocket: It's quite the undertaking.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 11:59:50] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: custom classes arent an issue with me </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:00:00] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: you havent seen my aix zenpack yet </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:00:17] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: you should ask matt for the screenshots </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:01:01] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: I have a os-&gt;volumegroup-&gt;logical_volume-&gt;filesystem relationship working .. </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:01:29] &lt;__ian__&gt; rocket: Well, that's good. You probably won't have an enormous amount of trouble, then. You might have a bit of a time with the servers, since they'd need to be mutated to a new class to include the relationship back to the HMC</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:01:58] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: I already mutated them for other screens I needed to do</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:02:03] &lt;__ian__&gt; rocket: Your previous statement was correct.

Probably just restarting zope and remodeling it will work.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:11:24] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: eg I was adding cdroms to my aix device and they didnt show up until i deleted the device and then discovered it again</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:11:50] &lt;rocket&gt;

__ian__: if what you say is true I am less concerned </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:13:46] &lt;__ian__&gt; If that doesn't work, a migrate script is an approach less drastic than deleting and re-adding.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:14:11] &lt;rocket&gt; __ian__: any examples of migrate scripts that might do that?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:14:13] &lt;__ian__&gt; tho I dunno why that'd be necessary in this scenario.</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 12:14:25] &lt;__ian__&gt;

the code is messy, but what it's trying to do is great</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 14:02:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; especially since I'm monitoring a bunch of windows servers using the default windows SNMP agent</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 14:02:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it sucks because the OIDs for the CPUs tend to wander</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 14:02:51] &lt;rocket&gt; rmatte: you just want it to start at 1?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 14:02:54] &lt;rmatte&gt;

the code duplicates a lot of effort :-) simply change "str(leaves)" to "str(leaves+1)" in the appropriate place</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 14:07:43] &lt;rocket&gt; try this line 83</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 14:08:04] &lt;rocket&gt;

ah</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 14:10:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's fixed now too</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 14:10:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; just modified the other line</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 14:10:28] &lt;rocket&gt;

you'll want to give the keys to your 'zenoss' user</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 16:09:44] &lt;davidX_&gt; my hp mibs have installed but i don't see a template under bindings, should something automagically occur from these, or?</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 16:10:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; no</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 16:11:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; MIBs are used by Zenoss to translate incoming SNMP traps</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 16:11:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; they aren't used for monitoring per se</span><br/><span> [14-May-2009 16:11:31] &lt;davidX_&gt;

right now we use buildbot with a ton of VMs, but we're not testing source builds on multiple platforms, just the install artifacts</span><br/><span> [15-May-2009 10:47:58] &lt;caseyh20&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [15-May-2009 10:48:03] &lt;mrayzenoss_&gt;

I have several web servers behind load balancers, I wonder if I can match "server down" events in such a way that if one server is down it is a warning, but if all servers are down it is a critical event, so zenoss matches up and down events about multiple devices</span><br/><span> [15-May-2009 12:19:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you could do that with an event transform</span><br/><span> [15-May-2009 12:20:19] &lt;afink&gt; Is there a way to have links drawn on the google map when you are on the same network, but not same subnet?</span><br/><span> [15-May-2009 12:20:22] &lt;jeld&gt;

I mean, somebody might be in here but nothing's scheduled</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:37:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; ummm, good question, let me check the timestamps...</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:37:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: if the reboot is scheduled, a maintenance window would suppress all events</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:38:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; there are actually 3 different blackberry servers that we are having this particular problem with, each with their own reboot schedule though</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:38:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; we can't suppress all events, we still need to actually see that the device rebooted</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:38:27] &lt;jb&gt; ah ok..</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:38:34] &lt;jb&gt; i can't seem to disable monitoring of any windows service in 2.4.1</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:38:41] &lt;jb&gt;&#160; Type: BadRequest</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:38:41] &lt;jb&gt; Value: The property port does not exist</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:38:42] &lt;jb&gt; Traceback (innermost last):</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:38:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; give each server a group, set up a maintenance window just for that server on it's reboot schedule</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:39:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; jb: seriously?&#160; I thought that was fixed</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:39:18] &lt;jb&gt; not for me </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:39:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; any way to still have the Device Reboot ticket stay in active events with the maintenance windows?</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:39:25] &lt;jb&gt; there may be a patch</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:39:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: hmmm.... there's a new feature in 2.4</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:39:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that adds events based on maintenance windows starting and stopping</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:40:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:41:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; it looks like these particular reboots are done by hand by the client, so the maintenance window would be like a 2 hour period, can't afford to suppress all events for that long</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:41:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; any other options?</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:41:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: there's a maintenance level that suppresses alerts, but not events</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:42:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or actually, I guess that's an alert schedule</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:43:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; a transform is looking like probably the only option, but I can't think of how I'd do it</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:44:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd have to do some function where it's like, if evt.summary == Device Reboot then for each event for device where evt.summary != Device Reboot set evt.severity = 0</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:45:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, there's probably a call similar to ZenEventManager.getEventList("device")</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:45:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that you can get to from the event</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:46:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I just can't find a good example</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:46:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; mara: you really need to read the Zenoss Admin Guide</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:47:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; the questions that you are asking are covered in there</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:47:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:47:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; the other issue is the amount of time that the events are spread over before/after the reboot</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:48:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; First Event: 2009/05/20 22:22:11.000</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:48:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; Reboot: Device Reboot</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:48:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; Last Event: 2009/05/20 22:27:03.000</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:48:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; oops</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:48:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; Reboot: 2009/05/20 22:25:58.000</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:48:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; rather</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:49:20] &lt;jb&gt; what event are you transforming ot get "Device Reboot" ?</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:49:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; snmp trap snmp_coldStart</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:49:57] &lt;jb&gt; i need to go thru and transform all of those</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:50:07] &lt;jb&gt; so you pretty much have them all transformed?</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:50:20] &lt;chudler&gt; rmatte:&#160; Would an event command (zendmd script) be able to handle this?</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:50:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just did evt.summary = 'Device Reboot' evt.component='REBOOT'</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:50:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; pretty simple</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:50:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; chudler: no idea</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:50:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; chudler: it's possible</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:51:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; chudler: that's a sneaky good idea</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:52:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm just wondering how I'd deal with the 5 minute time spread for the events</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:53:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Jane Curry's auto-discovery paper has a transform for snmp_coldStarts</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:53:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; I need tickets to be generated after a 60 second delay, which is how I have the ticket create command setup</span><br/><span><span> [21-May-2009 09:54:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/papers/jane/auto_disco_paper.pdf">http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/papers/jane/auto_disco_paper.pdf</a></span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:54:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; but the events are spread over 5 minutes, most come in 3 minutes before the actual reboot event</span><br/><span><span> [21-May-2009 09:56:45] &lt;jb&gt; mrayzenoss:&#160; i created a ticket @ </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/505">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/505</a></span><br/><span><span> [21-May-2009 09:56:55] &lt;jb&gt;

yeh, that coldstart transform is kind of for a specific scenario though</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:58:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; where you want devices moved between classes when rebooted</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:58:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; interesting trick though</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:59:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, I was just looking at transforms and you mentioned coldstart, reminded me</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:59:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 09:59:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; jb: updated your ticket, I think it's a regression</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 10:10:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, less than a minute in to the reboot cycle I always see Blackberry SRP Connection Dropped, maybe I can use that as a trigger for the transform</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 10:28:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; this is such a small fix, it's almost trivial</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 10:35:04] &lt;mara&gt; I have found my file snmpd.conf under /usr/local/zenoss/zenoss/etc/.

is it possible to add process monitor across multiple servers ?</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 16:37:13] &lt;pgega&gt; for example a class</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 16:58:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; pgega: you can add it globally, just click on "Services" on the left</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 16:58:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; enable it in there and it'll auto-apply it to any devices which it finds the process on when modelling them</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:01:32] &lt;pgega&gt; so the Services classes are not only for networking related serivces ie. http , ftp?</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:02:07] &lt;pgega&gt; i must monitor processes which do not listen on networking ports</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:17:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's for OS Processes as well</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:18:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; Which would be WinService</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:18:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; as long as you're monitoring them via SNMP, monitoring via WMI is a different story, but it should auto-discover them when modelling if you're taking that route</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:24:14] &lt;pgega&gt; rmatte, yes i am using snmp</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:24:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; then that's what you want</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:24:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; Services/WinServices</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:24:54] &lt;pgega&gt; so if i simply add some process to OSProcesses ,the process will be picked once zenoss will be remodeling devices ?</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:25:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:25:51] * pgega missed some documentation chapter...</span><br/><span> [21-May-2009 17:31:40] &lt;pgega&gt;

ah nevermind</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:01:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so I have a server with SNMP enabled on it, when I do an snmpwalk I can see the info for hard disks, interfaces, software, etc... When I model the device in Zenoss, it says that it's processing a bunch of snmp collector plugins but then quickly says "No change in configuration detected" right after, and never collects any info.</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:01:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; any ideas on what might be wrong?</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:32:59] &lt;aburgel&gt; hello</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:33:59] &lt;aburgel&gt; got a question about zenoss &amp; mysql... anyone around?</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:35:46] &lt;perr0&gt; why don't you just ask and see if anyone is around?</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:36:06] &lt;aburgel&gt; k</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:36:44] &lt;aburgel&gt; zenoss is opening and then immediately closing a connection to one of my mysql instances</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:36:53] &lt;perr0&gt; usually is active but I am assuming is quiet cause of the holiday</span><br/><span><span> [25-May-2009 10:37:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; Hope this gets looked at/fixed by the time 2.4.2 or 2.4.3 roll around: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.com/trac/ticket/5070">http://dev.zenoss.com/trac/ticket/5070</a></span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:37:43] &lt;aburgel&gt; not sure why zenoss is doing this, but it causes mysql to block connections from my zenoss server</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:38:01] &lt;perr0&gt; aburgel: is this a new install?</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:38:16] &lt;aburgel&gt; i thought it was the mysql zenpack template, but i turned it off and its still happening</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:38:27] &lt;aburgel&gt; not a new install</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:38:37] &lt;aburgel&gt; i've been having it for a while</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:39:00] &lt;aburgel&gt; first on 2.3, then i upgraded to 2.4.1 in hopes that it would go away, but its still happening</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:39:32] &lt;aburgel&gt; i've been monitoring with tcpdump, and i see a connection every minute that immediately closes</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:39:48] &lt;aburgel&gt; so i'm not sure which part of zenoss is doing this</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:41:11] &lt;perr0&gt; so it just happened all of a sudden of was this after you install the mysql zenpack?</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:42:24] &lt;aburgel&gt; i think after installing the zenpack, but i'm not 100% sure</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:42:36] &lt;HugoDaniel&gt; hi</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:42:40] &lt;HugoDaniel&gt; im about to try zenoss</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:43:03] &lt;aburgel&gt; i don't have an IPService on that device for mysql, but i do have an OSProcess for mysql</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:44:14] &lt;perr0&gt; aburgel: when you login to zenoss do you get an "Unable to connect to the MySQL server."?</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:44:26] &lt;aburgel&gt; no</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:44:38] &lt;aburgel&gt; this is a different mysql server</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:44:48] &lt;aburgel&gt; not the one used by zenoss for event logging</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:45:17] &lt;perr0&gt; got it</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:46:44] &lt;aburgel&gt; i think it could be zenstatus, but i have no idea how to confirm this, or to fix it</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:49:56] &lt;perr0&gt; aburgel: did you give zenoss the access to your MySQL server?</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:50:49] &lt;aburgel&gt; for the zenpack, yes. but i don't think its possible to configure zenstatus with a mysql login</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 10:51:06] &lt;aburgel&gt; but like i said, i disabled the zenpack and the problem still happens</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 11:07:02] &lt;aburgel&gt; if an IPService is not 'monitored', does that mean that zenoss still tries to connect, but just ignores the result? or does it mean that it doesn't try to connect at all?</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 11:11:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; it won't try to connect at all</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 11:12:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; and when modelling, it performs a portscan on the device and sees if any of the ports have been defined in Services, if so, then it adds it and starts monitoring it</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 11:15:01] &lt;aburgel&gt; is there any other part of zenoss that would connect to a port on a monitored device every minute? aside from zenstatus and a zenpack?</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 11:20:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; nope</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 11:21:37] &lt;aburgel&gt; i've removed the mysql IPService from zenoss, that seems to have stopped the connections (even though monitored=false), i'll play around with it some more to see if i can figure out what was wrong. i'll be back if i find something interesting</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 11:21:44] &lt;aburgel&gt; thanks for everyone's help</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 12:59:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; is there any quick way to remove Zenoss on Ubuntu?</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 12:59:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; I thought it added an entry to aptitude but apparently not</span><br/><span> [25-May-2009 13:01:04] &lt;rmatte&gt;

right again</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 14:53:55] &lt;jb&gt; i was using the same user to test</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 14:54:18] &lt;jb&gt; just tried it with another one that I had deleted.. when I re-created it, only the device group that I added previously appeared</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 14:54:22] &lt;jb&gt;

another semi-odd thing that I have discovered</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:06:04] &lt;jb&gt; if you add one system group to a user</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:06:07] &lt;jb&gt; and then add another</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:06:15] &lt;jb&gt; and choose "Browse By System" once you login</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:06:29] &lt;jb&gt; im automatically taken to the first system group that I have added, and the other system group is not visible</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:06:40] &lt;jb&gt;

if that makes any sense to you </span><img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:24:56] &lt;jb&gt; im a bit confused as to why modeling devices causes the invalid credentials error.. i confirmed by actually tailing event.log that it is occuring</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:25:14] &lt;jb&gt; but, im not sure what is causing the LDAP connection</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:26:11] &lt;jb&gt; pretty much everytime I click on something new in the GUI, a LDAP error is generated</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:28:29] &lt;jb&gt; its trying to authenticate the "admin" user</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:28:33] &lt;jb&gt; (thats what im logged in as right now)</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:28:37] &lt;jb&gt; its a local zenoss user</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:29:51] &lt;venturaville&gt; did you change the admin password by chance?</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:29:58] &lt;jb&gt; not since I enabled ldap</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:30:14] &lt;jb&gt; since the "admin" account is not a valid AD account</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:30:21] &lt;jb&gt; its obviously not able to auth</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:30:31] &lt;jb&gt; but it shouldn't be trying anyways, since its a local zenoss account</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:30:39] &lt;venturaville&gt; *shrug*</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:30:50] &lt;venturaville&gt; we saw lots of odd things break when we tried to change the default admin password</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:30:54] &lt;venturaville&gt; was just curious :-)</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:30:57] &lt;jb&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:31:12] &lt;jb&gt; it appears that zenoss tries to authenticate via LDAP every time you do something in teh GUI</span><br/><span> [29-May-2009 15:33:26] &lt;venturaville&gt;
