but how to point that "search for the process that this template is looking for in here?"</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 02:36:51] &lt;mf2hd&gt; or have i to make local copies for every process?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 03:27:37] &lt;mf2hd&gt; hmmz, basically it seems to be possible done with TALES, but I can't find proper TALES expression</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 03:27:58] &lt;mf2hd&gt; ${here/os/something/something}</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 05:32:14] &lt;roshenia&gt;

no solution?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 05:34:07] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; roshenia: no, not seen this before</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 05:34:13] &lt;roshenia&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 05:34:41] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; oh, lunchtime, cu l8er</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 05:36:49] &lt;roshenia&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 06:05:45] &lt;roshenia&gt; who use WmiPerf?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 06:06:02] &lt;roshenia&gt; WMI Data Source</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 07:29:31] straterr1 is now known as straterra</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 07:52:36] &lt;roshenia&gt; who use WMI Data Source?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 07:52:45] &lt;roshenia&gt; from zenpack</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:20:14] &lt;exarkun&gt; I aded the Server/SSH/Linux cpu and uptime data sources to a device last night.&#160; They didn't manage to collect any data, though.&#160; They just timed out a few hundred times.&#160; According to my ssh logs, zenoss did manage to log in via ssh.&#160; And if I test the data sources against the device manually, they work.&#160; But not so when they are run by the scheduler.&#160; Any ideas?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:21:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; exarkun: odd... does the user have an account on the box and a home directory?&#160; I assume you can ssh into the machine no problem?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:22:09] &lt;exarkun&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:23:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; anything in the zencommand logs of interest?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:24:02] &lt;exarkun&gt; Dunno, where do I look at those? :)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:24:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; $ZENHOME/logs/</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:24:18] * exarkun takes a look</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:24:34] &lt;cluther&gt; It would interesting to see if restarting the zencommand daemon corrects the problem.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:24:56] &lt;exarkun&gt; Lots of things like this:</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:24:58] &lt;exarkun&gt; 2009-10-01 09:16:55 WARNING zen.zencommand: Command timed out on device boson: '/bin/cat /proc/stat'</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:25:01] &lt;exarkun&gt;

mrayzenoss: any plans to put the organizer availability zenpack into core?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:30:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: what's that?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:31:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; its a custom report that allows you to do an availability based upon any organizer, be it group, system, location, etc</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:31:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; i know its in enterprise, i've got a 2.1 zenpack someone e-mailed me that does it, its extremely useful</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:34:22] &lt;exarkun&gt; Same results after restart</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:48:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; exarkun: from the top... you made a new device class and copied over the templates from /Server/SSH/Linux?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:48:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; did you add the collector plugins?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:48:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and bind the templates?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:51:39] &lt;exarkun&gt; I just used the /Server/SSH/Linux class directly, didn't create a new one or copy anything</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:52:21] &lt;exarkun&gt; ie, I went to the device's status page and picked Manage -&gt; Change Class</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:52:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; did you remodel after changing to the new device class?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:53:07] &lt;exarkun&gt; yea</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:53:24] &lt;exarkun&gt; ie, Manage -&gt; Model Device, right?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:55:20] &lt;exarkun&gt; I can re-create the device from scratch and try configuring it again, to make sure I actually did what I remember doing, or to set it up differently if there's a more conventional approach</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:55:47] &lt;exarkun&gt; This is all just a test setup, no important data anywhere</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:56:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well, if you're going to manage Linux boxes with SSH, I'd recommend adding the LinuxMonitorAddon</span><br/><span><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:56:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3493.html">docs/DOC-3493</a></span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:57:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; there were some gaps in the 2.4 LinuxMonitor ZenPack (2.5 adds them)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:57:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and then there are several more to add software inventory for distros</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:57:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Ubuntu, Fedora, SuSE, etc.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:57:59] &lt;exarkun&gt; I might have installed that one already (I remember looking at the page at least).</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:58:02] * exarkun checks</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 08:59:07] &lt;exarkun&gt; Hm nope, just LinuxMonitor.&#160; Cool, I'll install that.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:01:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; gotta run to a defect review</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:04:17] &lt;rocket&gt; exarkun: from the command line can you try running</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:04:32] &lt;rocket&gt; zencommand run -v 10 -d &lt;device_name&gt;</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:04:55] &lt;rocket&gt; and or "zenmodeler run -v 10 -d &lt;device_name&gt;</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:05:06] &lt;rocket&gt; that adds additional debugging</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:05:25] &lt;rocket&gt; also make sure if you have added any zenpacks you have restarted zenoss</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:07:57] &lt;exarkun&gt; Huh.&#160; The zencommand output makes me wonder if I configured the ssh key right.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:07:59] * exarkun checks that</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:09:00] &lt;jb&gt; morning!</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:11:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; morning jb</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:12:22] &lt;exarkun&gt; Okay.&#160; The ssh key thing was it.&#160; First I had the path wrong, then I had the permissions wrong, then I had the path wrong again, but then I got them both right and it succeeded. :)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:13:14] &lt;exarkun&gt; Is the extra output from that zencommand available in the web ui anywhere?&#160; It would have been pretty useful to see that it couldn't find the ssh key I told it to use.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:19:19] mrayzenoss1 is now known as mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:19:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; exarkun: you could turn up logging under Settings-&gt;Daemons-&gt;Edit Config</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:20:38] &lt;exarkun&gt; Awesome.&#160; Thanks.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:20:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; don't forget to turn it back down when everything is working</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:24:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; mrayzenoss: is that online training still going to happen?</span><br/><span><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:25:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/support/training">http://www.zenoss.com/support/training</a></span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:25:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; went live yesterday</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:31:48] &lt;twm1010&gt; excellent, im gonna try and get it budgeted for next year, i got a green light yesterday to move all systems alerting to it ASAP</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:40:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:41:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, thought they'd drop the pricing of the only training down a bit, but evidently not</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:41:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:41:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; only = online</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:41:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; (sorry, haven't had my coffee yet :P)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:41:33] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; coffee ......hmm that sounds like a good idea</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:41:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:44:04] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yay coffee</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:44:11] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; so process monitoring parameters, has that changed since 2.3.3?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:45:20] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; because Jane Curry's paper shows the ability to watch parameters to a process. rmatte correctly pointed out to me yesterday that they are separate oids</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:46:03] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; so, I am a bit confused as to whether or not checking for processes with params is possible</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:46:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm weird</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:46:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; any idea why my zentrap is doing this:</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:46:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; DEBUG:zen.ZenTrap:OID cache miss on 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.0.0 (exactMatch=True, strip=False)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:46:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's happening a TON</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:47:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; like 90% of the output is that</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:49:09] &lt;ckrough&gt; is that en error or just informative because its in DEBUG</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:53:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; no idea</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:53:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; "OID cache miss" strikes me as a possible error</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:53:53] &lt;ckrough&gt; sounds like its checking cache for something that isnt there</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:53:58] &lt;ckrough&gt; but it may have just aged out</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:54:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; possibly</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:55:49] &lt;bedwards&gt; hello, I am a Zenoss developer</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:55:57] &lt;cgibbons&gt; ohnoes!</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:56:10] &lt;bedwards&gt; are you driving?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:56:17] &lt;cgibbons&gt; nope i'm still asleep :)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 09:56:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:07:30] &lt;cluther&gt; rmatte: Are you around to talk about ticket #4997?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:07:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; yessir</span><br/><span><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:09:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok people, so Chet and I are having a discussion in regards to the following Trac ticket: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/4997">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/4997</a></span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:09:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; we're bringing it in to the channel in case anyone else wants to jump in with opinions/suggestions</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:10:04] &lt;ckrough&gt; oh, its thuirsday</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:10:05] &lt;cluther&gt; Great. So what I'm still stubbornly thinking about this is that the ifOperStatus should be completely ignored when determining which interfaces to monitor, but ifAdminStatus plays an important role.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:10:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see what you're saying, and quite honestly that would be fine... but this is how I'd envision that working...</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:11:00] &lt;ckrough&gt; Hmm</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:11:19] &lt;ckrough&gt; as a rep of a NOC I would prefer NOT to see those merged.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:11:27] &lt;cluther&gt; ckrough: I'm glad you're here for this one.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:11:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; First off, when someone manually tells Zenoss to monitor a port, it should check the port at that time (without requiring a remodel) to see if it's admin down</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:12:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it is, there should be some sort of dialog popup saying something like "The following ports are currently admin down and could not be set to monitored"</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:12:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; If it's not admin down, then Zenoss should start monitoring the port</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:12:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; none of this should require any kind of remodelling</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:12:59] &lt;cluther&gt; Ah.. I like that.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:13:30] &lt;ckrough&gt; That sounds like a larger scope than #4997, what is that a solution for ?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:13:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: It's a solution for the current behaviour of King Crab</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:14:04] &lt;ckrough&gt; I'm not up to speed on the problem at hand</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:14:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: 4997 is what led to the problem, so it's really a regression related to 4997 in my opinion</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:14:30] &lt;cluther&gt; rmatte: To put this into context the behavior for all versions leading up to King Crab (2.5) was completely ridiculous in that if the modeled ifOperStatus was down, the interface would not be monitored.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:14:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; If we need to open a new ticket for this then so be it</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:14:46] &lt;cluther&gt; #4997 changed this from using ifOperStatus to ifAdminStatus.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:14:57] &lt;cluther&gt; So it is at least a small step in the right direction.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:14:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; cluther: gotcha, which is awesome and what I expected</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:15:12] &lt;ckrough&gt; yeah, makes much more sense</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:15:42] &lt;ckrough&gt; Are you saying that interfaces are automatically monitored if they are ifAdmonStatus UP at modelling time?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:15:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; cluther: let me try something, maybe I misinterpreted how it works due to the lack of a dialog indicating why it wouldn't let me select a certain port to be monitored</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:16:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah I see, so if it's not admin down it does let you activate monitoring</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:17:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; didn't realize that's what the new design was based on, definitely need some sort of popup dialog box explaining to the user why it's not letting them enable monitoring</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:18:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; because everyone is pretty used to it just letting you enable monitoring on whatever you wish at this point</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:18:58] &lt;bedwards&gt; the bug states that O/A is obvious to network admins.&#160; I disagree.&#160; operational and admin status is a well known concept, but using O and A to represent them is Zenoss specific and confusing to any new user.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:19:07] &lt;cluther&gt; Do you think that would suffice? Is remodeling the device too much to ask to get the current admin status? The reason I ask is that the only good alternative to doing this would be to stick ifAdminStatus in the ethernetCsmacd performance template to keep a more up-to-date view. This would add another data point to collect for every interface.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:19:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; cluther: I don't like having to remodel to get current admin status of ports, there's no reason why you can't make Zenoss just quickly check that when enabling monitoring on a port</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:20:15] &lt;cluther&gt; rmatte: It becomes a bit trickier in distributed setups.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:20:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; cluther: some devices that we manage are in europe over really slow links and it takes like 30 minutes to remodel them</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:20:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; so we basically never remodel them</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:20:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; the fact that we need to do a full remodel just to enable monitoring on one port is insane</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:21:21] &lt;heckj&gt; Are there any good guides/notes written out there for how to drive Zenoss programatically (REST or XMLRPC)? I've seen the notes in the community site about how to call methods, but haven't found much else</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:21:28] &lt;cluther&gt; In the context of a 30 minute remodel I would agree.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:21:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's also very inefficient to have to remodel and have it poll tons of OIDs on the device when you only really need it to poll 1</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:22:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; cluther: you kind of have to look at this from all possibilities including devices monitored over slow links, there are many applications for Zenoss and it's features should take things like slow networks in to account</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:23:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus, from what I know about coding for Zenoss, wouldn't it just be another like 5 lines of code added to whatever function enables monitoring on interfaces to make it behave the way I'm describing?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:24:28] &lt;cluther&gt; Yeah.. the implementation is what bothers me though. We really don't like to have common UI operations actually go down and try to poll the devices. If you selected 400+ interfaces and enabled monitoring on them this would require 400 OIDs by polled.. potentially by a distributed collector that has the required network access to the monitored device. If the device was unreachable or slow this could take a very long time.</span><br/><span><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:25:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; heckj: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="community/documentation/official_documentation/zenoss-dev-guide">community/documentation/official_documentation/zenoss-dev-guide/</a></span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:25:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, we're monitoring hundreds of interfaces on one of our Zenoss boxes and it's not causing that major of performance issues honestly</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:26:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's barely noticeable</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:26:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, probably thousands of interfaces, I'd have to check</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:27:02] &lt;ckrough&gt; rmatte: zenoss box = a single zenoss install ?</span><br/><span><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:27:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; heckj: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="community/developers">community/developers</a></span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:27:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: yeh</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 10:27:17] &lt;heckj&gt; mrayzenoss: thanks, I was hoping for something a bit more external.

davetoo: yes</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:14:34] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; I'm having problems monitoring httpd still :/</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:15:17] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; using the Apache zenpack, but httpd is often listed as 'down' except when I'm first adding it to OSProcesses</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:15:25] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; if it's really a bug, I'll be happy to file a bug, but figure I am doing something stupid.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:26:46] bzed_ is now known as bzed</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:28:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; I have a feature for my xmas wish list</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:29:27] &lt;cgibbons&gt; oh?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:29:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; Allow a user to set a filter to be applied to all views</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:29:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; so, for example</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:30:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; in the main Event Console,</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:30:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; or any /Device organzier,</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:30:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; only show devices that match a particular /Location</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:30:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; or /Group</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:30:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; or /System</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:31:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; I was playing around with the device ACLs</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:31:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; doesn't quite cut it for me</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:31:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; I need a way to simplify the views that a user sees</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:31:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; but not change the interface drastically</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:32:47] &lt;cgibbons&gt; hrm all of that is about to be changed anyway. i'm trying to recall how that sort of thing was scoped out in the UI redesign but don't recall off the top of my head.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:32:53] &lt;cgibbons&gt; if ian were here he'd know :)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:33:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; I haven't looked at the display widgets/templates yet but it's probably almost as simple as the current filter box in the list displays</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:33:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh, tell me more about the ui redesign :)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:34:37] &lt;davetoo&gt; This is less about access control than simplifying my user experience</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:35:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; sort of an extension of the per-user event view concept, but would be a setting they could change themselves</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:35:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; if they wanted/needed to</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:35:29] &lt;davetoo&gt; that applied to all organizer views</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:36:15] &lt;cgibbons&gt; starts with the new event console that's in KC, but coming release(s) its a wholesale change to the UI to simplify it, make it more robust. we spent a lot of time with a usability expert getting the flow, etc. right so we're excited about it. i think we had some screen wireframes up for the community to look @ at one point; matt are those still around?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:38:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; great</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:38:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; !</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:39:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; I hacked Devices.py to put the zProperties tab back :)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:41:52] &lt;cgibbons&gt; matt, do we have the UI wireframes still out there somewhere?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:51:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; oops, I was wondering why this channel was so quiet</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:53:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:53:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; no voice?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:53:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; or you were offline?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:54:02] &lt;Brad_K&gt; he had a connection timeout</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:54:21] &lt;Brad_K&gt; then had to re-join and re-gain his op status</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:55:24] &lt;Brad_K&gt; actually, he went offline earlier: 11:19:28&#160; -!-mrayzenoss [n=Adium@24.173.187.218] has quit ["Leaving."]</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:56:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; did I miss anything? :)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:56:10] &lt;Brad_K&gt; then came back: 11:50:52&#160; -!-mrayzenoss [n=Adium@24.173.187.218] has joined #zenoss</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:56:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; I finally figured out how to make Pidgin ignore those messages :O</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:56:13] &lt;Brad_K&gt; 11:51:08&#160; -!-mode/#zenoss [+o mrayzenoss] by ChanServ</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:56:16] &lt;Brad_K&gt; 11:51:30&#160; &lt;@mrayzenoss&gt; oops, I was wondering why this channel was so quiet</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:56:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes, mrayzenoss,</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:56:36] &lt;Brad_K&gt; cgibbons was wondering where the new UI wireframes were.</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 11:56:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; we were wondering if the mockups (wireframes) of the ne UI design were up</span><br/><span><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:01:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; Brad_K: there's a demo: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://public-demo.zenoss.com/evconsole">http://public-demo.zenoss.com/evconsole</a></span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:01:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's obviously majorly incomplete</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:01:17] &lt;davetoo1&gt; but just the event console?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:01:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it'll give you some idea</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:01:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo1: the event console is all that's making it in to King Crab from the new UI, the rest will make it in to Stone Crab</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:02:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; what he said</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:03:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; and stone crab is like 7 months away</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:03:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or if you live on the bleeding edge, about a week</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:03:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:04:24] &lt;kobs&gt; I have a question, the template for interface high utilization where is the text stored that gets passed into evt.summary when the threshold is reached and when it rearms?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:06:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobs: that's a hard coded string unless you modify it using a transform</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:06:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; It defaults to something like "threshold of &lt;threshold name&gt; exceeded: current value &lt;value&gt;"</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:06:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobs: yeah, you're probably safer transforming the text than editing the code</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:07:11] &lt;kobs&gt; ok well the threshold crossing is slightly different then the rearm lol</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:07:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I've been meaning to open a ticket for that</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:07:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; one has a capitalized first letter and one doesn't</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:07:39] &lt;kobs&gt; like the T in threshold on the crossing is a lower case and the : at the end</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:07:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:07:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's been like that for a long time, lord knows why</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:07:59] &lt;kobs&gt; yeah its a pain when trying to do a transform ;)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:08:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you're probably not doing the transform the best way possible then</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:08:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; can you pastebin what you have so far?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:08:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; you probably want something like:</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:08:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; import re</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:08:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; feh</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:09:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; Comcast is annotying me</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:09:19] &lt;kobs&gt; i have this for the match match = re.search('^.hreshold of [^:]+: current value ([\d\.]+)', evt.message)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:09:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; if re.search('hreshold of whatever exceeded',evt.summary):</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:09:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could use the ignore case option too</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:10:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; re.search('bleh',evt.summary,IGNORECASE)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:11:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, at least I believe that's how you'd do it, feels like I'm missing something though, hmmm</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:11:12] &lt;kobs&gt; there is a colon at the end</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:11:22] &lt;kobs&gt; of current value</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:11:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, I mean with the way I'm doing the ignore</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:11:37] &lt;kobs&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:12:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh right</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:12:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; re.search('bleh',evt.summary,re.IGNORECASE)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:12:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think that's how you do it</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:13:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you could just do...</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:13:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; erm</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:13:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:13:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; re.search('threshold of',evt.summary,re.IGNORECASE)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:13:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it should technically work</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:13:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; though a more complex regex would most likely be preferable</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:14:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; I didn't realize you could specify the options that way; interesting</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:14:58] &lt;rocket&gt;&#160; davetoo: the /usr/local/bin thing is fixed and in svn it should be resolved in the next beta</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:15:42] &lt;rocket&gt; davetoo: the top thing should only affect memory/swap stats .. there are quite a few bugs fixed in the next beta that is soon to be released</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:16:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; I wish I were more familiar with modern Solaris; seems that early Solaris 10 releases are a fair bit different that later releases</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:16:53] &lt;rocket&gt; yeah .. the current ones are more likely to resemble solaris 11</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:17:14] &lt;kobs&gt; rmatte: thanks for the help I will give that a try</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:17:32] &lt;rocket&gt; davetoo: get my message about the solaris issues you are seeing?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:18:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; Think sow</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:18:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; two lines?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:18:56] &lt;rocket&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:19:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobs: np, I'll log a trac ticket for that issue</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:19:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: haven't seen you around in a while, how's it going?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:20:00] &lt;rocket&gt; its going well .. busy busy busy :)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:20:27] &lt;rocket&gt; thinking about adding a new daemon that gathers RSS feeds</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:21:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:22:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, very busy over here too, working on an automated report system that will interface with Zenoss</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:22:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; also working on a python daemon to pull events from Zenoss and generate tickets in our ticketing system (it'll be better than our current solution as it will actually queue events)</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:23:35] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; rmatte: what ticketing system are you using?</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:23:43] &lt;rocket&gt; thats the one I was going to ask :p</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:23:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; ke4qqq: OTRS</span><br/><span> [01-Oct-2009 12:23:58] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Maybe 3 different step-by-step zenpack docs that walk you through making an example zenpack from scratch</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 10:42:31] &lt;ckrough&gt; could probably introduce best practices in there as well</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 10:42:54] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yeah, and making better APIs for the common things ZenPacks do would help a lot. right now it's too tightly coupled with the internal architecture.</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 10:42:56] &lt;ckrough&gt; each of the 3 could be a difference difficulty level. beginner, intermediate, adv</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 10:42:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 10:42:59] &lt;chudler&gt; I would rather see the zenpacks go out there with as little QA as possible.&#160; I dont currently have a way to find problems in my zenpacks until AFTER they have been approved.</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 10:43:14] &lt;chudler&gt; like a staging area sort of thing</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 10:43:16] &lt;ckrough&gt; thats what beta testing is for</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 10:43:18] &lt;ckrough&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 10:43:37] &lt;ckrough&gt; dont hide them until completion, but have a way to identify QC'd packs vs staging</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 10:44:05] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; a RHT person who is honest will tell you that overall the quality of community packaged stuff is higher than RHT-generated stuff - you should look at some of the stuff RHT was doing in packages before guidelines were introduced.

kisielk, you need to turn on that performance colelctor</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:48:31] &lt;MorkBork&gt; yea</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:48:39] &lt;kisielk&gt; hm okay</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:48:42] &lt;kisielk&gt; how do I add the collector?</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:48:44] &lt;MorkBork&gt; because net-snmp only works with freebsd /var/db/pkg and rpm distribution</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:48:54] &lt;tbozz&gt; made changes to eventclass of a http template check, but the change does not seem to be taking effect.&#160; Any thoughts?</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:49:01] &lt;MorkBork&gt; i looked at net-snmp to check that last night</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:49:07] &lt;kisielk&gt; ahhh</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:49:10] &lt;kisielk&gt; there we go</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:49:11] &lt;MorkBork&gt; uses librpm to discover installed packages :(</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:49:30] &lt;kisielk&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:55:31] &lt;Brad_K&gt; tbozz: did you re-model and push changes to the collector(s)?</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:56:15] &lt;tbozz&gt; I did not remodel, and in 2.4.5 with one collector (localhost) I do not see the option to push to collectors anymore</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:56:31] &lt;tbozz&gt; is a remodel needed?</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:56:54] &lt;Brad_K&gt; unless you want to wait for the 12-hour cycle re-model cron job, i would think so.</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:57:18] &lt;tbozz&gt; ok, did not realize that template changes required a re-model.&#160; I will try that</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:57:27] &lt;tbozz&gt; thx</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 16:57:47] &lt;Brad_K&gt; maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.&#160; but i have developed a habit of re-modeling after every single change.</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 17:08:03] &lt;tbozz&gt; Brad_K: hmm remodeled, but no change</span><br/><span> [02-Oct-2009 17:08:19] &lt;tbozz&gt;

do you only need it for the one machine?</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 08:55:13] &lt;simprix&gt; no</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 08:55:18] &lt;simprix&gt; multiple linux boxes.</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 08:56:05] &lt;twm1010&gt;

ok, so at a high level, you want to modify the performance template in that class</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 08:59:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; and add a threshold</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 09:06:58] &lt;simprix&gt;

otherwise it's just bytes used</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 09:18:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; who cares what the graph shows, you only need the threshold to be .9 * collected value, eh?</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 09:18:08] &lt;twm1010&gt;

sure, i get it.</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 09:19:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; say, is there a list of the variables, like $here/hw/totalMemory?</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 09:19:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; they aren't standard, they are based on whatever is defined in the collector plugin being used</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 09:19:54] &lt;twm1010&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 09:20:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; totalMemory is fairly standard though with the stock collector plugins</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 09:20:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; what's the one for device name?</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 09:20:36] &lt;twm1010&gt;

it worked fine with the router interfaces in the previous graph</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:01:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, show how you're trying to use it</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:01:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; im editing the datapoint itself</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:02:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, I want to know where you're putting that and how you're formatting it</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:02:14] &lt;twm1010&gt; in the legend field, im trying to reference the device name and then either inbound/outbound</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:02:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; Ah, I see</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:02:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you're editing the datapoint IN the graph</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:02:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; not outside of it</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:02:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; ya, one datapoint, multiple servers</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:03:07] &lt;twm1010&gt; so the legend should reflect the source</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:03:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I don't think you can use that in the graph options, since it's not related to the graph itself</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:03:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; for instance: ${graphPoint/id} is a valid graph option</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:04:16] &lt;twm1010&gt; odd, it worked in another graph, but that was tracking interface utilization, not something come from a perf template</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 10:05:28] &lt;rmatte&gt;

hmmm, when I remove the drive and remodel the device the drive doesn't get added back to the list even though nothing is locked down on the OS tab</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:19:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, it's timing out</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:19:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; time to increase collector client timeout time</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:21:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hate this particular server, the link to it is so slow that you can literally read the SNMP info line by line as you snmpwalk it</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:23:52] &lt;tmcnicho&gt; rmatte: you familiar with the apache monitor?</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:24:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, haven't used it</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:28:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; there, now it suddenly has the correct info</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:29:59] &lt;tmcnicho&gt; where does one adjust collector intervals?</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:31:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; tmcnicho: depends on the protocol</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:31:35] &lt;tmcnicho&gt; in this case, performance information gathered via the WMI datasource zenpack</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:33:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; there doesn't appear tp be a specific place to set that</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:33:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; it probably just follows whatever is set for the collector cycle time, but I don't know for sure</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:34:47] &lt;tmcnicho&gt; gotcha, but you can't adjust collector cycle by node/class or anything right</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:34:49] &lt;tmcnicho&gt; its by collector?</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:34:55] &lt;rmatte&gt;

tmcnicho: the bad news is he's reusing the SNMP Collector Interval</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:35:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's what I thought</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:35:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so if you bump up WMI collection cycles, you'll get faster SNMP ones as well</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:35:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; maybe open a bug for Egor on that?</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:37:42] &lt;cain22&gt; hello all...</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:39:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; @mrayzenoss: well... maybe... it'd almost be nice to override collection cycles based on device class too, or even set it as a zproperty on the device</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:39:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: yeah, right now that's a mixed bag</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:39:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; for instance in solarwinds i can set a custom collection cycle on almost anything, be it interface, performance</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:39:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: you can override Command data sources at the zProperties</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:40:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: yeah, we didn't get around to fixing that completely with 2.5</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:45:59] &lt;cain22&gt; quick question, is there a way to have a person have alerts from only one device sent to them...or a group of devices..?</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:46:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; cain22: yes, you need to configure alerts filters for your alerts</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:46:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to an alert and look down on the page, you'll see where you can add filters</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:46:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; something like: if device name = whatever</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:46:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; or if device class is bleh</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:47:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's a whole range of options, you can also filter by severiting, my event summary contents, etc...</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:47:24] &lt;cain22&gt; ah, much obliged</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:47:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; severity*</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:47:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:47:34] &lt;cain22&gt; yeah, noticed that, just not by device</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:47:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should be able to do it by device name</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:48:07] &lt;cain22&gt; yeah, noticed now</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:48:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 11:48:13] &lt;cain22&gt;

or sorry, it stands for "milli"</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 14:41:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; so milliprocesses, in that case</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 14:41:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 14:49:26] &lt;kobalt&gt; is there anyway to take a trap oid modify it and then have zentrap reprocess it? basicly I have a mib loaded for a cisco 1545 (cerent mibs) the device sends the trap as 3607.6.30.5100 and the mib is 3607.30.0.5100 so its not finding the trap due to the 0 not being sent</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 14:49:48] &lt;kobalt&gt; so I was wondering if I could do a transform to add the 0 and then have it be reprocessed</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:00:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; why not just fix the device?</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:14:05] patzer_ is now known as patzer</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:16:05] &lt;sloof3&gt;

so what happens if two identical datasources are bound to the same server in different templates</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:49:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: double polling I'd imagine</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:50:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; Make sure I got this right, collection intervals can be set on certain datasources</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:51:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; apache monitor let met set it, command will as well</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:51:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; command based datasources, yes</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:51:30] &lt;twm1010&gt; but SNMP and WMI are global?</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:51:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; snmp based datasources, and WMI, no</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:51:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: not that I'm aware of</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:53:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; So under the current implementation I'd need a second collector with shorter collection cycles</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:54:37] &lt;twm1010&gt; but even then, that would be for the whole device</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:58:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; So where does Egor's WMI datasource receive it's cycle interval from?</span><br/><span><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:58:48] &lt;rmatte&gt;

twm1010: from the global interval</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:59:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the collector interval, rather</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:59:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; ah, the one that SNMP adheres to as well</span><br/><span> [05-Oct-2009 15:59:43] &lt;twm1010&gt;

and the multi-graph shows everything before i changed it</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:18:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; but only for two of the four servers</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:19:23] &lt;twm1010&gt;

when you change polling intervals, that affects the RRD graphs</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:26:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; since they use the polling intervals in the RRDCREATE command</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:29:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; I see, so i should probably just nuke my RRD files and let it start new</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:30:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; unless you want to investigate the RRDTools for updating your existing data</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:30:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; not really no</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:30:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; and i'd have to do that before i changed it</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:31:13] &lt;eidolon&gt; mmm, rrdtools.</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:32:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; well, hold on, i just nuked the RRD files</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:32:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; yet the multi-graph report still has old data?</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:32:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; really?</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:33:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; ah, no, i only cleared one of them, hold on</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:33:39] &lt;ckrough&gt; OT: anyone going to the puppet training in Austin next month?</span><br/><span> [06-Oct-2009 14:33:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

mrayzenoss: no tracebacks from what I can see</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:01:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:01:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; just trying to put out a good release :)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:01:31] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; On is on the second run</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:01:48] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; first is without On, second is with</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:02:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah I see</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:03:11] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; yeah, it's the weirdest thing in the world</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:04:22] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; only thing I can think of is /maybe/ the parser (since it's set to auto) chose one parser for the other SNMP extended values that do work, and a different one for this one because it's above 1024</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:04:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: you could try deleting the RRD file</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:04:42] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; (other snmp extended values range 0-10)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:05:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; you've ruled out some sort of OID typo I assume</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:05:14] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:05:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: yeh, Zenoss stores the performance data that it collects in RRD files...</span><br/><span><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:05:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

cool thx</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:07:44] &lt;exarkun&gt; rmatte: daemonization is mostly fork, exit in the parent, setsid in the child, fork, exit in the parent, do anything else you want in the child (eg close fds, change working directory, etc)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:09:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: 15-20</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:10:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; exarkun: I'm not that advanced at python yet, so using something like what chudler suggested is more down my alley</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:10:44] * exarkun nods</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:10:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm getting there though</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:11:27] &lt;chudler&gt; that script could help you learn, it works about the way described</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:11:27] &lt;exarkun&gt; I didn't notice that link before I answered.&#160; That looks like a decent thing to use.</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:11:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it looks pretty nice, supports a pid file too which is excellent</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:21:18] &lt;chudler&gt; is there still the trac-zenpacks page?&#160; or svn access?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:21:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; chudler: yes</span><br/><span><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:21:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; chudler: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://zenpacks.zenoss.org">http://zenpacks.zenoss.org</a></span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:22:24] &lt;chudler&gt; thanks, I'm way behind the curve on all the changes.&#160; I am gearing up for some more dev work soon</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:23:07] &lt;chudler&gt; so it is all still svn, right?&#160; I can has commit access?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:23:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I gave you an account didn't I?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:23:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; back when it was community.zenoss.org?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:23:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; same credentials</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:23:49] &lt;chudler&gt; hm, perhaps.&#160; I haven't tried to use it until now.&#160; thanks!</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:24:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; let me know if you have any trouble</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:24:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: what's it showing now?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:32:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: I see, though your sales Engineers apparently need previous sales experience?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:42:31] &lt;etank&gt; mrayzenoss: do you know if there is a target date yet for the release of 2.5?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:42:44] &lt;etank&gt; it just came up in a meeting and someone was asking for a date</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:43:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's not public yet, but RC1 will be out probably by Monday</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:44:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; although mrayzenoss has already been smuggling out copies of it on the down-low</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:44:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:44:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; (I kid)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:45:20] &lt;npmccallum&gt; rmatte: first one's free, but the next one will cost you :)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:45:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; npmccallum: darn</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 10:46:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: ah</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:30:36] &lt;twm1010&gt; RC1 :D</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:32:50] &lt;eidolon&gt; hey fols, in the zenoss enterprise zenpack for mssql monitoring, what login does it use to the mssql server to get statistics?&#160; i dont' see a zproperty from the template that looks right</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:32:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; Has anyone succesfully setup a second local collector?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:33:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; eidolon: wouldn't it use zWinUser and zWinPass??</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:33:21] &lt;eidolon&gt; i don't know - would it?&#160; :)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:33:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm... i would think if it's using ZenWinPerf then it is :)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:33:49] &lt;eidolon&gt; my mssql data rates and lock times RRD graphs are empty</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:34:21] &lt;eidolon&gt; owait. hm.&#160; *checks something</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:34:31] &lt;eidolon&gt; aha.</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:34:38] &lt;eidolon&gt; i was looking at the 'offline' side of hte mssql cluster.</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:34:51] &lt;eidolon&gt; we have 2 mssql hosts, only one is live at a time in the cluster.&#160; the offline one had no stats, duh.</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:34:57] &lt;eidolon&gt; nm!&#160; :)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:35:07] &lt;twm1010&gt; still, its a good question</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:35:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; it must get that performance data from the performance counters then, and not through any SQL method</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:35:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; cuz SQL could have its own authentication as well as windows integrated right?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:35:49] &lt;eidolon&gt; well, it actually logs into the mssql cluster to ask it, i believe.&#160; so there has to be permission for the zwinuser to log into mssql.</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:36:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, gotcha</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:39:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; bbiab</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:47:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; for anyone wanting multiple devices with the same IPs...</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:48:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; use the Device Add-&gt;Easy Add and use the FQDN for your hosts</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:48:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you'll get a new device for each FQDN, even if the IPs are dupes</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:48:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; of course, your network stuff will get completely confused</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:48:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; Back...</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:48:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; like Networks and Network Map</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:49:11] &lt;twm1010&gt; mrayzenoss: is it possible to run two collectors on one machine?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:50:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, but you'll have to edit some files</span><br/><span><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:52:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2497.html">docs/DOC-2497</a><span> and </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2496.html">docs/DOC-2496</a></span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:52:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, got any docs? i saw the ones about distributed collectors, but nothing on multiple on the same box</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:52:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's the same pattern, just have to use different ports</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:56:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; on a better note, i used a mutli-graph report to show our bandwidth utilization from our e-commerce webservers and the border routers to show the bandwidth usage</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:57:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; i think i finally got my point across with how useful Zenoss is</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:58:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, i understand the docs, but not sure what you'd do different to setup a second local collector</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 11:58:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; perhaps someone will write a how-to for that</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:11:24] &lt;kisielk&gt; hm, okay, I still can't figure out how to change the priority of my devices</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:11:35] &lt;kisielk&gt; I always get an error if I try from the Devices tree</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:21:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: I'm able to use the "Reset IP" option to change a device's IP and it doesn't complain if it matches another device's IP, though the device is in a custom production state that mimics Decommed, so that may have something to do with it</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:23:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; it does work with FQDN as well via Add Device</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:34:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: yeah, there are ways to add more than 1 device per IP</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:34:56] &lt;skipzoid&gt; hey all</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:34:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I was asked about it in Twitter, so I thought I'd repost my answer here</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:35:02] &lt;Mituc&gt; hey guys</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:35:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; greetings</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:36:27] &lt;Mituc&gt; can anyone help me with a zenoss issue I can't find a solution for? since a while now I keep getting no events except for some heartbeat failures from the zenoss components (zencommand, zenperfsnmp, and so on)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:36:33] &lt;Mituc&gt; I can't find anything relevant into the logs</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:36:38] &lt;Mituc&gt; any idea about where to look?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:37:28] &lt;Mituc&gt; this started to happen after the server zenoss runs on ran out of memory and the oom killed zenhub</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:38:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; how much memory are you running on?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:38:14] &lt;Mituc&gt; I ran the weekly cronjob to pack the zope datafile again (why is that taken off zenoss and replaced with some mysql tables?!)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:38:18] &lt;Mituc&gt; but no luck</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:38:27] &lt;Mituc&gt; mrayzenoss: 4GB</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:38:51] &lt;skipzoid&gt; i've downloaded a zenpack to monitor a linux box - where can I find documentaction to follow so i can bind the zenpack to the device ?</span><br/><span><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:39:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

The Zope DB contains all the relations and object information, MySQL holds events</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:41:22] &lt;Mituc&gt; the only thing that still fills up some logs is the zenaction, but I think that will just fill up some queue since it can't connect to the hub properly.</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:41:26] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Mituc: Zenoss will act strange without enough memory, but 4 gigs sounds good.&#160; How big is your install?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:42:10] &lt;Mituc&gt; mrayzenoss: well, that zope datafile is a big ugly thing, and slow. I know what that file holds, but I think those relations between objects could have been implemented in a less exotic database...</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:42:27] &lt;magnachef&gt; is there a release date yet for King Crab?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:42:43] &lt;Mituc&gt; well, my install is not that big, the peak size for the Data.fs file was 3GB I think, it's now like 350MB after packing it</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:42:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; magnachef: we're about to branch 2.5 in SVN, RC1 will be the next beta drop</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:43:04] &lt;magnachef&gt; ok, thanks</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:43:22] &lt;Mituc&gt; the thing is that I can't figure out why nothing works now..</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:43:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Mituc: perhaps you could shut everything down, and bring it up a little at a time?</span><br/><span><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:44:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

which is good</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:47:42] &lt;skipzoid&gt; @mrayzenoss: thanks for the link - there doesnt seem to be a practical example ?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:49:12] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; skipzoid: not sure what you're looking for.&#160; The /Server/SSH/Linux device class just works</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:50:00] &lt;skipzoid&gt; ah - then maybe I thought it was more complicated than it really is - i'm just restarting zenoss and then a remodel?</span><br/><span><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:50:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the LinuxMonitorAddon adds more stuff to it </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3493.html">docs/DOC-3493</a></span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:50:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; skipzoid: just put your devices in the class, and remodel</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:51:31] &lt;Mituc&gt;

is there a walkthough on how to setup monitoring of the output of lm_sensors ?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:55:33] &lt;eidolon&gt; can zenoss be configured so a user can -only- see a certain set of hosts? ?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:55:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; skipzoid: I doubt it, you'd have to write a script to process the output, and then integrate the script with Zenoss</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:56:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; eidolon: That can be done with ACLs, but that is an enterprise feature, not available in Core.</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:56:12] &lt;skipzoid&gt; the first part isnt a problem :) the last part might be...</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:56:16] &lt;eidolon&gt; we're running enterprise.</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:56:24] &lt;eidolon&gt; &lt;-- paid zenoss customer :)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 12:56:31] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I need to have a different threshold value for each of these scenarios</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 13:33:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you mean if the value of that OID is less than 0, don't apply the threshold?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 13:33:59] &lt;mdiorio&gt; Actually, it's a different threshold.</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 13:34:18] &lt;mdiorio&gt; if OID is less than zero, the possibilities are -3 for toner level normal, and -2 for toner low.</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 13:34:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ok, so keying off the initial value of the OID, choose which template to bind...</span><br/><span><span> [07-Oct-2009 13:35:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the closest I've seen to that is </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://zenpacks.zenoss.org/trac-zenpacks/browser/zenpacks/ZenPacks.community.HPSIMMonitor/ZenPacks/community/HPSIMMonitor/modeler/plugins/community/snmp/HPDeviceTemplateMap.py">http://zenpacks.zenoss.org/trac-zenpacks/browser/zenpacks/ZenPacks.community.HPSIMMonitor/ZenPacks/community/HPSIMMonitor/modeler/plugins/community/snmp/HPDeviceTemplateMap.py</a></span><br/><span><span> [07-Oct-2009 13:35:46] &lt;exarkun&gt;

tung: yeah, it's a work in progress</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 14:05:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; there's lots of docs and examples</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 14:05:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's not super hard</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 14:05:25] &lt;tung&gt;

increase the ping timeout and ping tries</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:51:55] &lt;boodle&gt; mrayzenoss: ty, trying</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:51:55] &lt;l2huynh&gt; ok, thanks ryan</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:52:36] &lt;l2huynh&gt; symtom: 3 days ago, I started to get zen daemons heartbeat failure from localhost</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:52:50] &lt;l2huynh&gt; namely zenactions and zenmodeler</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:53:02] &lt;l2huynh&gt; did not change the hostname</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:53:29] &lt;l2huynh&gt; since this problem started, it seems to me that it affected zenperfsnmp also</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:53:42] &lt;l2huynh&gt; because started to get broken graphs</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:53:54] &lt;boodle&gt; mrayzenoss: set both to 10 and still get failures (manual pings show them up)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:54:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: check your collector performance graphs</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:54:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; see if the cycle times increased</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:54:34] &lt;l2huynh&gt; nope, kept everything at default</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:54:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

l2huynh: usually when that happens to be it's because I have way too many snmp timeouts</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:56:47] &lt;l2huynh&gt; only zenperfsnmp and zenmodeler are visible though</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:56:53] &lt;davetoo1&gt; from devices with bad snmp configs or crashed snmpd daemons</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:56:56] davetoo1 is now known as DaveToo</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:57:10] &lt;DaveToo&gt; what does your zenperfsnmp logfile look like?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:57:14] DaveToo is now known as davetoo</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:57:33] &lt;l2huynh&gt; zenmodeler cycle time increased from 0 to 150 yesterday</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:57:42] &lt;l2huynh&gt; and increased to 200 today</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:57:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; l2huynh: verify that you don't have a ton of snmp errors</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:58:12] &lt;boodle&gt; mrayzenoss: still the same</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:59:06] &lt;l2huynh&gt; i only got 3 snmp time out for the last 3 days,</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:59:17] &lt;l2huynh&gt; prior to that, there wasn't any snmp timeout</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:59:39] &lt;l2huynh&gt; zenperfsnmp log file did not show anything abnormal</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 15:59:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; Then it's not my usual problem :)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:00:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; boodle: did you clear out those events?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:00:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and they're still coming back?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:00:40] &lt;boodle&gt; mrayzenoss: yep..</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:00:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; l2huynh: how many devices/datapoints?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:02:08] &lt;l2huynh&gt; i have about 25 devices</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:03:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; What does the memory utilization on your zenoss sytem look like?&#160; My next suspicion would be that you're running out of memory for disk cache and it's starting to write directly to the filesystem</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:03:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; l2huynh: how slow is the box?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:04:18] &lt;l2huynh&gt; i'm running it with vmware appliance</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:05:15] &lt;l2huynh&gt; the box is pretty slow now, take about 15 seconds to get the perf tab properly loaded</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:05:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:05:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; sheesh</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:06:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes you are probably just overloaded</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:06:03] &lt;l2huynh&gt; davetoo: it look like you've diagnosed it</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:06:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: in the zenperfsnmp logfile, do you see any errors?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:06:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: yeh, sounds like the box is overworked, how many devices are you monitoring?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:07:28] &lt;l2huynh&gt; only 25</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:08:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; How much memory does the VM have?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:08:15] &lt;l2huynh&gt; rmatte: the only error are for the 7 devices that i have not enable snmp for</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:09:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; look through every single log file for errors</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:09:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; it shouldn't be running that slow with only 25 devices monitored</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:10:09] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I think that the swap file is getting eaten up now</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:10:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; if the host machine is underpowered all sorts of bad things can happen</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:10:51] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I currently have 131MB for swap</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:11:00] &lt;l2huynh&gt; is it low?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:11:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; swapping VMs == badness</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:11:20] &lt;l2huynh&gt; is there any way around it ray?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:11:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; how much ram is on the host machine?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:11:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I've got the VM on a 4 gig laptop</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:11:37] &lt;l2huynh&gt; the host machine has 4G</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:11:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hmmm...</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:11:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; how much does the VM have allocated to it?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:11:52] &lt;l2huynh&gt; 1.5G is dedicated to the VM</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:11:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 1 gig</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:12:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 1cpu &amp; 1024 mb by default</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:12:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; It used to be the case that I wanted enough RAM to keep all of the RRD files cached</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:12:35] &lt;davetoo&gt; with the new RRDTools I'm not sure if that's still required</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:12:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah RRDTools has gotten a little better</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:13:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; but 1G should be plenty for 25 devices</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:13:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; you're not running X on the VM are you? :)</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:13:19] &lt;l2huynh&gt; X ?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:13:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; is that the Zenoss-provided VM?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:13:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; Anything else that might be taking up memory?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:13:43] &lt;l2huynh&gt; yes, that's the Zenoss-provided VM</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:14:09] &lt;l2huynh&gt; not that I know of</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:14:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; are you running more than 1 VM?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:14:26] &lt;l2huynh&gt; nope, just one</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:14:41] &lt;l2huynh&gt; the host is dedicated to zenoss</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:15:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; *sigh*</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:15:25] &lt;rmatte&gt;

or choice of property names</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:16:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: not really, you have the key related to the event, the key related to the class, and the class itself</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:16:24] &lt;l2huynh&gt; oh, ok</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:17:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; So where does eventClassKey come from?</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:17:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; oooook, so, this code that I've been working on for the last few days and have finally perfected runs perfectly fine on it's own, but as soon as I throw some daemon code in to it it completely bombs</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:17:34] &lt;davetoo&gt;

What I'm trying to do is "roll up" all the events for a device into one summary event</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:20:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; and only send that summary event to the pagers</span><br/><span> [07-Oct-2009 16:20:18] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Hello</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 03:00:55] &lt;morbidi&gt; I'm in the process of configuring zenoss, and I've just added a device (windows server 2003) which I _can_ ping from the box where I installed zenoss but the ping utility is telling me the server is down, I tried to google but don't know what expression to look for</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 03:01:07] &lt;morbidi&gt; can you give me some kind of hint ?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 07:05:43] &lt;LarsN_&gt; I currently have three devices in my Zenoss Monitor in Maintenance mode because of strange behaviour.&#160; Currently I have our standard /Devices/Server template, and a local copy of the HttpMonitor template applied.&#160; The HttpMonitor isn't functioning the way I would expect.&#160; When there is an alert, It creates an event, with proper summary, first time (now) last time (now) count 1.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 07:06:19] &lt;LarsN_&gt; In 5 minutes when the next poll takes place, I will receive a Clear Event, followed immediately with a new HTTP Critical alert.&#160; again with (now) (now) 1</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 07:07:18] &lt;LarsN_&gt; because the count isn't going up, I'm receiving, currently 1 email per 5 minutes, per device.&#160; Rather than 1 e-mail per event and then bumping the count.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 07:07:51] &lt;LarsN_&gt; all other monitors except SMTP do incriment the count correctly.&#160; Any suggestions on where I should be looking?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:01:08] &lt;sergio&gt; Hi to all. how can I add a threshold for swap usage... e.g. 50 percentage?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:04:58] &lt;sergio&gt; how can I set a threshold in percentage ?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:12:00] &lt;ckrough&gt; "here.whatever *.9" would be 90% of 'whatever'</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:12:20] &lt;ckrough&gt; are you monitoring linux?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:13:48] &lt;sergio&gt; e.g. here.swap *.5 and the data source will be 'memAvailSwap' from the default device template... is it correct?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:14:13] &lt;sergio&gt; ckrough: most devices are freebsd...</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:14:19] &lt;ckrough&gt; that would trigger them the amount of available swap hit 50%, you are probably looking for the opposite</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:15:10] &lt;ckrough&gt; doesnt look like the UCD-SNMP-MIB returns UsedSwap</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:15:16] &lt;ckrough&gt; just available and total</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:17:27] &lt;sergio&gt; so what would be the right way?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:21:51] &lt;ckrough&gt; create a threshold for memAvailSwap with a 'min value' of "memAvailSwap * .9"</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:22:06] &lt;ckrough&gt; that would alert you if less than 90% of swap was available</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:37:48] &lt;sergio&gt; cgibbons: i'added threshold as you suggested, I added the threshold to the graph, however I got the following message on the perf page: User-supplied Python expression (here.memAvailSwap * .9) for minimum value caused error: ['memAvailSwap_memAvailSwap']</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:37:58] &lt;sergio&gt; ckrough: *</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:41:57] &lt;ckrough&gt; sergio: sorry, only half paying attention.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:48:08] &lt;ckrough&gt; "here.memAvailSwap *.9" worked for me</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:52:19] &lt;sergio&gt; ckrough: without quotes... right?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:52:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; you don't have to do the ${} ?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:56:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; not in that case</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 08:56:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; the ${} is for command based datapoints and event manager commands section</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 09:05:42] &lt;sergio&gt; when I add threshold with the minvalue here.memAvailSwap * .9 and selected data point memAvailSwap_memAvailSwap it became False...</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 09:20:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, that's strange, on my lab box, my Windows SNMP Performance Monitor (Simple) ZenPack is throwing "Code: 2 - Msg: Misuse of shell builtins" errors</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 09:20:14] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I don't know if anyone downloaded my Windows SNMP Performance Monitor (Simple) ZenPack, but it had a bug in it which caused it not to work, I just updated the ZenPack page with a working version.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 10:13:26] &lt;ckrough&gt; rmatte: I assume Advanced doesnt have the bug?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 10:14:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 10:14:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; advanced is perfectly fine</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 10:15:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; the bug was actually because I had forgotten to change the line for the simple template, so it was actually using the advanced scripts</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 10:15:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; which means it would work fine as long as the advanced ZenPack was installed, but wouldn't work by itself</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 10:15:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 10:15:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that's fixed now</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 10:19:08] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; any thoughts on whether to bond multiple nics for Zenoss - does it hamper anything. /me is thinking of plugging in a NIC to different switches to eliminate switch failure as a possibility</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 10:50:04] &lt;rmatte&gt;

In the new event console</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 12:57:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think he assumed that it'd be possible using the filters, but that's tedious since you have to do something like &gt;

k</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 12:59:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; when you select first seen and last seen filter options, it will only match events that match those dates, so for instance, 2009-10-08 for first seen and 2009-10-16 for last seen will only show events with a start and end date that matches those dates (time doesn't seem to matter), the problem with that is that it's impossible to actually select a range</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 12:59:27] &lt;metalklesk&gt;

yes I've done that</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:03:30] &lt;kisielk&gt; and like I said, they all show green in the OS tab</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:03:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you've tried a reindex() and commit() in zendmd?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:04:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you've pushed changes to the collector?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:04:05] &lt;kisielk&gt; I have no idea about reindex, what does it do?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:04:08] &lt;kisielk&gt; there's only one collector</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:04:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; fixed indexing issues in the zope database.&#160; I've fixed false positive process alerts by doing it in the past</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:04:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; fixes*</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:06:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; doesn't matter if there's only 1 collector, if you haven't waited a full hour for your changes to be pushed you need to push them by hand</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:06:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; the collector only comes back to Zenoss for updated monitoring config every hour</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:06:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; regardless of whether it's the single local collector or some remote one</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:07:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to go to the device page and select Manage -&gt; Push Changes</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:07:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you could have it detect new processes but the collector won't know about it for upwards of an hour until you actuall push the changes</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:07:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; comprende?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:14:32] &lt;kisielk&gt; hm, well, it's been several days</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:14:35] &lt;kisielk&gt; since this started happening</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:14:46] &lt;kisielk&gt; so presumably that's not the problem</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:15:18] &lt;kisielk&gt; but I'll try all those things</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:15:31] &lt;kisielk&gt; maybe one of them will be the magic trigger that will make it work</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:19:22] &lt;kisielk&gt; hm, nope, none of that helped</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:19:29] &lt;kisielk&gt; events came right back with "process not running"</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:19:44] &lt;kisielk&gt; but again all the processes show green in the OS tab</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:19:51] &lt;mdiorio&gt; Any ZenPack Devs out there than can give me a hand?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:20:42] &lt;chemist&gt; Hi, zenoss stopped emailing a couple of days ago, I have been of work so only noticed tonight, I checked the zenactions log and there was nothing in it for the last couple of days</span><br/><span><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:21:23] &lt;chemist&gt; I restarted it,checkedthe log and found this </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.ca/1604809">http://pastebin.ca/1604809</a></span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:21:58] &lt;chemist&gt; can someone explain what it means? I restarted zenoss and it's now ok</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:23:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; chemist: the first error on that pretty much says it all</span><br/><span><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:23:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: is this what you were describing? </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5658">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5658</a></span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:23:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; specifically (has zCommandPassword been set?)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:23:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: no, that's some other bug...</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:23:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; peachy</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:24:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you were missing the ranges in the history?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:24:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's completely missing the ability to select the period that you want to view events for</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:24:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should have the same style fields as the old event console had right at the top for selecting that</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:24:50] &lt;chemist&gt; rmatte: how would that affect zenoss' ability to send alerts?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:24:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's all I'm saying</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:25:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; chemist: is it sending alerts via email?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:25:31] &lt;chemist&gt; it is now, but only after a restart</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:25:58] &lt;metalklesk&gt; it has 20 minutes modeling ...</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:28:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; chemist: is your SMTP server passworded?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:28:42] &lt;chemist&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:33:27] &lt;chemist&gt; it's now alerting again, but only after a restart</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:40:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; chemist: is this the first time this has happened?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:41:32] &lt;chemist&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:42:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; then I wouldn't worry about it</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:42:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it happens again then I'd be concerned</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:42:43] &lt;chemist&gt; I need a monitoring system for the monitoring system :)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:49:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what we do</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:49:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; we have 1 zenoss box monitoring all of the tohers</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:49:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; others*</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:49:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then 1 monitoring that one</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:50:15] &lt;exarkun&gt; Is there an enumeration of available data sources in the web ui somewhere?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:54:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; exarkun: when you add a template, it shows you a list</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:54:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; err, data source</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:56:06] &lt;exarkun&gt; Hmm, right.&#160; I saw that list but didn't understand it.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:57:52] &lt;exarkun&gt; yay, I broke it</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:57:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; yay</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:59:51] &lt;exarkun&gt; What's the usual workflow for making or modifying a ZenPack?&#160; I'm about 12 lines in to mine so far, and so far I'm editing the source directly in /usr/local/zenoss/zenoss/ZenPacks/... and restarting the server between edits to see what happens.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 13:59:58] &lt;exarkun&gt; This is... uncomfortable.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:05:30] &lt;leafnunes&gt; exarkun: is it the server restarts that are uncomfortable?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:06:08] &lt;leafnunes&gt; exarkun: or the location of the sources? you can safeguard your work by copying that directory somewhere else and using 'zenpack --install=/new/path/to/pack --link'</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:07:33] &lt;exarkun&gt; Changing the location of the source will probably help.&#160; Maybe I can even start version controlling it.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:07:53] &lt;exarkun&gt; The server restarts are a bit of a pain.&#160; For whatever reason (maybe because it's running in a vm), that takes about 30 seconds.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:08:25] &lt;exarkun&gt; But actually if I back up, then even having to run the server and click around in my web browser isn't much fun.&#160; I'd much rather be writing and running unit tests.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:09:06] &lt;exarkun&gt; I probably can't deal with that until I'm more comfortable with the ZenPack APIs, though.&#160; Unless there are some test fixtures in Zenoss that will hold my hand?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:14:48] &lt;mdiorio&gt; Matt...know any reason why I can't get the value of zDeviceTemplates from within the PrinterToner modeler source?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:15:49] &lt;mdiorio&gt; I followed malbon's HPSIMMonitor zenpack, but what he did, I keep getting errors reading/writing zDeviceTemplates.&#160; As if the PrinterToner's device doesn't expose that property</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:31:42] &lt;leafnunes&gt; exarkun: yeah, i'm not having a great time with the code+webgui implementation paradigm.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:33:17] &lt;metalklesk_&gt; does anyone of you have an SLES 11 installed in a box ? not vm</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:33:40] &lt;exarkun&gt; The way zenpacks can be constructed in the webui seems kind of neat, although it'll probably be quite a while before I get the hang of it.&#160; But yea, I'm having trouble finding the line between actually programming and clicking around in the gui.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:36:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; exarkun: depends on when you want to start using custom scripts</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:36:45] &lt;exarkun&gt; Probably.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:36:55] &lt;exarkun&gt; Maybe it's not common for that to be the first thing someone wants. :)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:37:09] &lt;l2huynh&gt; rmatte: I'm back with the same problem</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:37:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, not common for that to be the first thing someone learns, is more like it</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:37:43] LarsN_Away is now known as LarsN_</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:37:50] &lt;exarkun&gt; I /did/ spend 4 or 5 days getting familiar with the web ui and the more administrative type tasks first.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:37:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: is that the graph value that is either way higher or lower than when snmpwalked?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:37:53] LarsN_ is now known as LarsN</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:38:15] &lt;exarkun&gt; But only because I knew I'd want at least a minimal familiarity with what Zenoss does before trying to extend it non-trivially. :)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:38:17] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I think the problem is that zenoss is running really slow</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:38:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; exarkun: takes a while longer than 4 to 5 days, and you really need to read the admin guide in it's entirety, would be a great idea to read all of Jane Curry's papers as well</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:38:34] &lt;LarsN&gt; does anyone know where I can get the MIBS for tripplite PDU devices?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:38:35] &lt;l2huynh&gt; It can't even sync with ntp properly</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:38:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: what kind of system are you running it on?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:39:02] &lt;l2huynh&gt; vm 2.5</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:39:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; and running slow wouldn't cause distorted values</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:39:14] &lt;exarkun&gt; rmatte: I don't mind getting in over my head. :)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:40:11] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I see, but with the broken graphs, I guess that zenperfsnmp runs for a while and then stop?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:40:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, you're the one with the overall performance issue?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:40:36] &lt;l2huynh&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:40:38] &lt;l2huynh&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:40:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; (sorry, I deal with a lot of different people in here)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:40:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; hard to keep track</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:40:46] &lt;l2huynh&gt; i understand</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:41:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you tried running a fresh VM just to see if you see similar issues with it?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:41:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you do then it'd be a system resource issue</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:41:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you don't then it's obviously an issue with that VM</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:41:56] &lt;l2huynh&gt; i'm contemplating migrating away from vm</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:42:13] &lt;l2huynh&gt; don't know if it's a good idea, given the fact that I'm linux illiterate</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:42:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; we use VMs, but not the prebuilt Zenoss one, and we run them on proper ESX servers</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:42:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll have to get linux literate at some point</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:42:42] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I'm trying :)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:42:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; try harder!</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:42:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:43:09] &lt;l2huynh&gt; too many things at hand,</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:43:14] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I'm doing my ccnp also</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:43:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; now drop and give me 10 linux commands!</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:43:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:43:30] &lt;l2huynh&gt; ls</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:43:35] &lt;l2huynh&gt; grep</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:43:35] &lt;l2huynh&gt; ...</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:43:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; hint: meow</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:44:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; more hints: furry, hairball, claws</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:44:30] &lt;kmtsun&gt; is there an online training course pretty cheap out there?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:44:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; online training course for Zenoss you mean?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:44:48] &lt;l2huynh&gt; cat</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:44:48] &lt;l2huynh&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:44:48] &lt;l2huynh&gt; thanx</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:44:50] &lt;kmtsun&gt; yep..</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:45:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; kmtsun: they offer online training but it's like $2000</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:45:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; $1500 if you're a paying customer</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:45:31] &lt;kmtsun&gt; yeah... was hoping someone knew a cheaper source</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:45:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; not for online</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:45:53] &lt;kmtsun&gt; kk thanks</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:45:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know that Jane Curry offers courses, but you'd have to fly to the UK for that :)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:46:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; heck, I should start offering online courses, could make some money :)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:46:55] &lt;kmtsun&gt; yeah.. you could</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:47:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just may do that eventually</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:47:22] &lt;l2huynh&gt; good idea</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:47:29] &lt;kmtsun&gt; start with me... how much?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:47:34] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I don't mind driving to ottawa</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:47:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:47:43] &lt;kmtsun&gt; im in indiana</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:48:03] &lt;kmtsun&gt; that's in usa</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:48:07] &lt;kmtsun&gt;&#160;&#160; :P</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:48:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm in Canada, so yeh, it'd have to be an online course, I'd have to get stuff setup first and I don't have the time or money to do it yet</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:48:20] &lt;kmtsun&gt; i c</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:48:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; full time job kind of takes over</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:51:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; kmtsun: quite honestly, just download it, install it, read the admin guide, screw around with it, if you have any questions ask here</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:51:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should pick up the basics fairly quickly</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:53:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: for troubleshooting that issue I'd recommend installing a fresh VM (keep the old one kicking around of course), add the devices in, and see if the issues re-surface</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:53:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; just as a starting point</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:53:14] &lt;kmtsun&gt; well i have most of the basics down</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:53:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; kmtsun: what would you be looking at learning?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:53:28] &lt;kmtsun&gt; im just having problems with alerts not incrmenting</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:53:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; what do you mean by not incrementing?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:54:09] &lt;kmtsun&gt; do one problem will trip an alert ..the clear... trip an alert... then clear.. over and oever</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:54:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, well, clear events are designed to do that</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:54:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; what types of problems?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:54:47] &lt;LarsN&gt; rmatte: even if, as an example, I do apachectl stop.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:54:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; node down, interface down?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:54:52] &lt;kmtsun&gt; like monitoring a website</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:54:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:55:01] &lt;LarsN&gt; rmatte: httpmonitor shouldn't ever "clear" that.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:55:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; so httpmon</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:55:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; LarsN: what if apachectl suddenly starts again?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:55:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; LarsN: shouldn't clear?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:55:49] &lt;LarsN&gt; rmatte: if apache was started, it should clear I'd agree.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:56:10] &lt;LarsN&gt; rmatte: but if apache is NOT running, it shouldn't clear/alert/clear/alert/clear/alert at each polling interval</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:56:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; it shouldn't clear while it's still stopped, it's not designed to do that</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:56:27] &lt;LarsN&gt; which is exactly what it "is" doing</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:56:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never seen anything like that, something is obviously screwy with your installation</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:57:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I monitor a lot of processes and lots of stull with httpmonitor and everything only clears when it returns to an active state</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:57:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; we don't get jittery alerting like that</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:57:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; stull == stuff</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:58:18] &lt;LarsN&gt; rmatte: thanks for at least confirming my suspicion.&#160; something is 'wonky" :)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:58:54] &lt;kmtsun&gt; LarsN: where are you?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:59:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; LarsN: well, it's definitely not normal Zenoss behaviour</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 14:59:52] &lt;rmatte&gt;

l2huynh: sounds like that's more of a problem with how your VM is dealing with time</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 15:12:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: you may consider configuring NTP on there</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 15:15:22] &lt;l2huynh&gt;

Anybody on here have recommendations for economical NOC wall displays?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 15:23:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; I think I want something like a couple of 40"-ers in portrait orientation</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 15:48:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: just get regular 720p tvs, that's what we use</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 15:48:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: or a projector</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 15:48:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; (we used to use a projector back in the day, not as good as the TVs though)</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 16:18:49] &lt;l2huynh&gt;

girls rock!k</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:32:37] &lt;leafnunes&gt; is there a straightforward way of turning off a specific service monitoring in a subclass?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:32:50] &lt;leafnunes&gt; other than on a device-by-device basis</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:40:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; no</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:41:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; it's per-device&#160; or global, unfortunately</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:46:56] &lt;leafnunes&gt; so the best way to do this is to create templates from scratch</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:47:00] &lt;leafnunes&gt; sad</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:47:15] &lt;leafnunes&gt; i want everything but smtp!</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:48:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; no, I don't think you can do it with templates</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:48:21] &lt;leafnunes&gt; ...</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:48:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; you're talking about IP Services?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:48:33] &lt;leafnunes&gt; so i just have to not inherit from any other devices?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:48:36] &lt;leafnunes&gt; yes.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:48:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; there is no inheritance</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:49:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; you can only set it gobally,</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:49:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; or per-device</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:49:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; it is a design fault IMO</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:49:09] &lt;leafnunes&gt; i see.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:49:32] &lt;leafnunes&gt; so one has IpServices as part of monitoring a device</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:50:07] &lt;leafnunes&gt; and whether smtp is monitored is controlled by device or globally, but not in the device class.</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 17:50:15] &lt;leafnunes&gt; that does seem like a design fault</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 19:45:47] &lt;ironpaw&gt; anyone around?</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 20:17:02] &lt;ironpaw&gt; rgh</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 20:17:05] * ironpaw cries</span><br/><span> [08-Oct-2009 20:29:11] &lt;leafnunes&gt;

yes</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:12:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you CAN ssh to that device by hand from the Zenoss box?</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:13:03] &lt;metalklesk&gt; but i am not sure if the problem is zenoss</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:13:13] &lt;metalklesk&gt; from zenoss ?</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:13:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's why I'm saying, try to ssh to it by hand from the zenoss box</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:13:16] &lt;metalklesk&gt; how =</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:13:17] &lt;metalklesk&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:13:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, Zenoss runs on linux, so you login to Linux and issue the ssh command</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:13:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; this is pretty basic stuff</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:13:40] &lt;metalklesk&gt;

you need to actually try SSHing from the Zenoss server itself</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:14:52] &lt;metalklesk&gt; the firewall is down :(</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:15:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; then it may be something else, just try it</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:15:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should not take 180 seconds to gather that data, so I'm better on a non-zenoss related issue</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:15:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; betting*</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:16:24] &lt;metalklesk&gt; i don't think is a problem of zenoss</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:16:42] &lt;metalklesk&gt; because i can monitor my linux box (not virtual machine)</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:16:53] &lt;metalklesk&gt;

ok</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:40:06] &lt;metalklesk&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:40:22] &lt;metalklesk&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:40:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; is it a vmware vm or something else?</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:40:26] &lt;metalklesk&gt;

yup, it should</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:41:19] &lt;metalklesk&gt; i will run ubuntu again in a virtual machine to see what happens</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:41:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; then again all of our vmware linux boxes are monitored via SNMP</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:41:30] &lt;rmatte&gt;

well thats what template is called</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:48:40] &lt;swarog&gt; "device"</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:48:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; There should be a template available called HP Insight or something</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:49:01] &lt;swarog&gt; more&gt;templates&gt;bind templates</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:49:33] &lt;swarog&gt; well, it isnt ... what now?</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:49:33] &lt;swarog&gt; any idea what addiotional OIDs are with insight agent?</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:49:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll need to find out where the zenpack put the template</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:49:33] &lt;swarog&gt; so i should snmpwalk it</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:49:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to the zenpack page and check the objects for it</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:49:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have no idea</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:50:27] &lt;swarog&gt; ok, im there</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:50:28] &lt;swarog&gt; what now?</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:50:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; like I said, look through the objects listed to find the location of the template</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:51:55] &lt;swarog&gt; hmm on disk?</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:52:05] &lt;swarog&gt; i mean, location on disk or what?</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:52:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, eugh, ok, when a zenpack installs device templates it puts them in a specific device organizer</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:52:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm guessing that the template isn't in the device organize that you need it to be, and it's not being inherited from a higher device organizer</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:52:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you need to find where it was placed and then move it to the appropriate location</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:53:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should technically be right under /Server</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:53:15] &lt;swarog&gt; its under /manufacturer</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:53:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; Manufacturer isn't a device organizer</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:53:42] &lt;swarog&gt; under zenpack details i have "metadata, deps, file in zenpack, zenpack provides"</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 09:53:43] &lt;rmatte&gt;

set the regex and then saved it and did a test</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:14:23] &lt;kobalt&gt; its still comming in as /unknown</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:17:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: ummm, I think you missed the point of the mapping</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:18:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; setting defaultmapping as the eventkey in the event mapping and setting the regex makes that the mapping for that event</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:18:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can then customize that mapping to do what you wish with the event</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:18:33] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok so the mapping has to be created in /unknown?</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:18:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, it can be created anywhere</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:18:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; so long as it has defaultmapping as the key</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:18:53] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok it has that</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:19:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; defaultmapping applies to any event with not event key which comes in as /Unknown</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:19:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; the event will still come in as /Unknown though</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:19:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; it will still come in as /unknown</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:19:20] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:19:27] &lt;kobalt&gt; thats what I was not understanding</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:19:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that mapping will apply to it since it has defaultmapping and matches the regex</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:19:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; the mapping can be put under any class</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:20:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's impossible to directly map an event that comes in with no key, so that's the way to do it for events that don't</span><br/><span> [09-Oct-2009 13:22:27] &lt;kobalt&gt;

gotcha</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:10:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; ckrough: we will find out :)</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:10:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; you can add noatime, data=writeback after the fact right? not a filesystem expert here</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:10:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; just edit fstab?</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:10:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; My development system has a six-spindle RAID10</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:10:39] &lt;ckrough&gt; davetoo: we tried a SAN but the IO we introduced was too much, moved back to DAS</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:10:41] &lt;davetoo&gt; writeback is not in fstab;</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:10:55] &lt;davetoo&gt; twm1010: you use tunefs</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:11:05] &lt;ckrough&gt; davetoo: yeah, my standard collector is a 2 spindle raid1 for the OS, and a 6 spindle 15k RAID10 for perf partition</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:11:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; or the option when you first mkfs</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:11:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:11:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; 6 x 15k SAS</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:11:40] &lt;ckrough&gt; yeah, same</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:11:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; Before I do that, I'm using a 6x72GB 15k an LVM on RAID5</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:11:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; was a hand-me-down Dell box of some flavor</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:12:16] &lt;ckrough&gt; davetoo: might depend on your OS, it could be specified in grub on the ROOT= line</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:12:54] &lt;ckrough&gt; davetoo: "data=writeback" in mount options of fstab for RHEL/CentOS</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:13:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:13:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; interesting</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:13:06] &lt;ckrough&gt; actually the grub thing would just be for the root /</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:13:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; writeback is the least-safe journaling algorithm, I guess</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:13:41] &lt;ckrough&gt; you'll want to read up on that option if you arent already familiar with journaling. some inherent risk with using it</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:14:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes which is why I only use it on the perf volume</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:14:03] &lt;ckrough&gt; yeah, least safe, so if you dont trust your storage or cant afford to lose some data, it may not be worth it</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:14:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; I consider the perf data somewhat expendable</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:14:15] &lt;ckrough&gt; same</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:14:20] &lt;ckrough&gt; to a point</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:14:35] &lt;ckrough&gt; most likely just lose a single polling cycle on a couple devices, well within SLA</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:14:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; gotcha, but noatime is just so it doesn't update access times right?</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:14:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:14:56] &lt;ckrough&gt; yeah, with RRD thats a lot of extra writing</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:15:18] &lt;ckrough&gt; noatime implies nodiratime as well</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:15:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; damn, that didn't fix it</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:15:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; rrdtool disk access is the most important performance knob here</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:16:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; in fact, I try to be sure that I have enough RAM to keep all of my RRDs cached,</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:16:10] &lt;ckrough&gt; twm1010: RAID5 is a bad idea for perf</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:16:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; working with what i have</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:16:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; a tired server, with tired drives</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:16:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; tho I've never actually maxed-out one of my newer boxes with the RAID-10</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:16:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; twm1010: but can you re-build the RAID volume?</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:16:53] &lt;ckrough&gt; not sure how much overhead LVM introduces also</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:17:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; twm1010: what size are the drives ?</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:17:12] &lt;ckrough&gt; there are some CPU based calculations associated with that, but from what I've read its negligible on modern hardware</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:17:15] &lt;twm1010&gt;

stupid girlfriend pushed me out of bed when the alarm went off, so I'd turn it off and let her keep sleeping.</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:21:04] &lt;ckrough&gt; ha</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:21:37] &lt;davetoo&gt;

that again</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:23:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; there is something going on where invoking zenperfsnmp manually doesn't actually do the snmp poll</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:23:46] &lt;ckrough&gt; what version is this</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:24:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; and fwiw, I've only seen that behavior in 2.4.x</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:25:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; 2.4.2</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:25:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; I think I even opened a support ticket about it, but not a trac ticket yet</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:25:17] &lt;twm1010&gt; i've held off on 2.4.5 because of something rmatte mentioned it breaking</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:26:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; I honestly think this is a weird issue with SNMP v1/v2c</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:26:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; the first time i added these devices i was only having issues with the interfaces, switched the dev class to v2c, and now some of the perf counters are misbehaving</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:26:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; its not even showing sysUptime correctly, and i'm using the standard template from /Devices for that</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:30:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; I don't have any ASAs to compare notes about</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:52:08] &lt;sloof3&gt; Tell me if this is possible with ZenOSS.&#160; I'd like to use the class system currently used by ZenOSS to graph certain OIDs for general classes of devices. On top of that I'd like to be able to graph other OIDs on a case by case basis without creating dozens of subclasses.&#160; Just a quick "Bind this template to this device".</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:52:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yes, you can bind templates to individual devices</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:54:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and you can add templates that are used at the device class level for those "certain OIDs"</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 09:54:40] &lt;sloof3&gt; Excellent</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:00:21] &lt;sloof3&gt; Am I correct in assuming the class structure allows for template inheritance?</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:03:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yes, a template added at /Devices will be available to everything below it</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:03:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; not bound, but available</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:05:54] &lt;twm1010&gt; and if you bind to a class, it binds to all device in the classes, unless overridden</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:16:59] &lt;sloof3&gt; "Delete Template" doesn't actually delete the template, just unbinds?</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:19:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; no, that will delete it.&#160; To unbind, go to "Bind Templates" and deselect the one you don't want to use</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:31:52] &lt;sloof3&gt; Lets see if I understand this:&#160; Every device has the 'device' template bound to it.&#160; Where 'device' is defined is dependant on first match from the individual device level up to /Device</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:35:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; Not really no, every device receives its bindings from device class unless overridden</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:35:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; at /Devices, the "Device" template is bound to at the minimum get system uptime via SNMP</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:36:01] &lt;sloof3&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:36:20] &lt;twm1010&gt; this is inherited down the chain, but overridden at places like /Devices/Servers/Windows</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:36:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; Where the standard Windows template checks uptime, so the "Device" template is not needed</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:36:35] &lt;sloof3&gt; So /Device/Network/Router/Cisco has a 'device' template which queries uptime/cisco and mem free?</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:36:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; Yes</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:37:03] &lt;sloof3&gt; uptime/cpu/mem*</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:38:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; its all inheritance</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:38:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; unless overridden, or you change the bindings</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:46:20] &lt;sloof3&gt; Overriding occurs in zProperties?</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:46:37] &lt;metalklesk&gt; mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 10:46:40] &lt;metalklesk&gt;

when you say "</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 11:38:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; turn off, what exactly are you trying to do</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 11:39:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; for instance, ip services is port monitoring, you would have to through services/ipservices/ and find the ports/applications that are currently set to automonitor and set their zproperty to false.</span><br/><span> [12-Oct-2009 11:39:35] &lt;twm1010&gt;

Plus it has an (almost working) Solaris ssh template</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:01:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: I'd be very careful with rushing in to using 2.5 as prod, I'd at least wait until 2.5.1</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:01:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's always a bunch of bug fixes that get done shortly after release</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:01:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; aye</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:02:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm thinking about not using snmp-based process monitoring at all</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:02:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm going to be thoroughly testing it before it goes anywhere near by prod boxes</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:02:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; too quirky</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:02:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I haven't really had any issues with the snmp process monitoring, but I'm not monitoring java processes or anything with it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:03:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; even the zenoss daemons give me fits, because $0 is /usr/bin/python</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:07:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:07:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm monitoring the zenoss daemons perfectly fine</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:07:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; okay maybe it's a PEBCAK</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:08:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; you mean a PEBKAC</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:09:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:10:05] &lt;cwj&gt; six of one and half a dozen of the other</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:11:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; cwj: hm?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:11:43] &lt;cwj&gt; whether the problem is between the chair and keyboard or the keyboard and chair, it is expressing the same idea</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:11:52] &lt;cwj&gt; just like "six" is the same thing as "half a dozen"</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:12:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; true</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:13:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; but thinkgeek agrees with me: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/sysadmin/6692/">http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/sysadmin/6692/</a></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:13:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I win</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:13:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; odd, i cannot login to zenoss from firefox on my own PC</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:13:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; yet, it works elsewhere</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:14:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: clear the cache and try again</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:14:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; did that a few times now</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:15:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; trying that clear personal data wizard</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:15:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; can you at least ping or ssh to the server?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:15:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; try telneting to port 8080 on the server</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:15:30] &lt;twm1010&gt; oh absolutely, its my machine thats the issue</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:15:35] &lt;twm1010&gt; it works from my laptop :P</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:15:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; does it work from any browsers other than firefox?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:16:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; hah, there it works again, very odd</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:16:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; mhmmm</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:16:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah, IE and Opera worked, but they tend to display the page wrong</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:16:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, they do</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:16:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; i had to blow out all of my personal info out of firefox</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:16:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; ? for you.... a thread post recently had me back off my zMaxOID value on one of my device classes, fixed my ASA monitoring.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:16:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; had you ever actually closed firefox after clearing the cache?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:17:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; Now just how the heck are you supposed to know when to do that?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:17:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: it really only applies to ASA as far as I can see</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:17:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; hah, ok. just making sure i wasn't missing some basic skill or something here, i suppose blasting the device with snmpwalk might have revealed that</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:18:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: that's always worth a shot if a device isn't responding to SNMP in Zenoss and you've tried everything else</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:18:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, generally, if you can snmpwalk the device from the zenoss box but Zenoss is throwing SNMP Agent Down events, you can pretty much figure that that's the issue</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:18:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; ahh.. and i suppose the standard SNMPwalk only grabs system which is only like 15 OIDs</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:19:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, standard snmpwalk queries 1 OID at a time I believe</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:19:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; whereas Zenoss tries for like 40 by default</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:19:20] &lt;twm1010&gt; Hrmm... ok.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:19:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; It fixed my interface polling, uptime, all my graphs</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:19:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:19:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; CiscoASAs are picky about packet size</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:21:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; By trying to grab 40 in one go the packet is larger than the ASA will permit</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:21:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you need to back it down to like 20 or 10</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:21:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; That makes sense.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:22:17] &lt;twm1010&gt; Moving on, next goal, DB2 monitoring</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:22:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; have fun with that :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:23:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; heh, i'm hoping for a Nagios plugin</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:23:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you might be able to find one</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:27:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; where are the included nagios plugins kept?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:28:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; there aren't any included to my knowledge</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:28:14] &lt;twm1010&gt; really? i thought there were a ton of them</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:28:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; not that I'm aware of</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:28:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; They have nagios plugin support, but I don't see why they'd actually package a bunch with it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:28:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; especially since you can use google to find any plugins you need</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:28:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah, $ZENHOME/common/libexec</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:29:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:29:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm.. might be one directory higher than that</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:29:54] &lt;twm1010&gt; still, missing the one i want... but thats okay</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:29:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's in $ZENHOME/../common/libexec</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:30:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just write my own custom scripts and just have them output in nagios format</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:30:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I guess there's no point in reinventing the wheel :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:31:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; or when you're not a DBA and don't know what to monitor :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:31:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:31:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you ask your DBA :P</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:32:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; this looks promising</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:32:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Databases/DB2/check_db2_health/details">http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Databases/DB2/check_db2_health/details</a></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:33:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that does</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:36:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; Actually, this might make a great ZenPack</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:36:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; it definitely could</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:38:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; but it would be a template you'd have to copy</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:38:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; you couldn't use generic datasources, everyone's databases will have different names</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:39:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:39:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that's not bad, you don't generally have a million DB2 servers</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:39:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you set it up for each server you have and then forget about it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:43:02] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; Hi guys, I have created a mib tree.... is there a way to force zenoss to create a template according to that MIB file?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:43:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: Mibs are not used for monitoring templates at all, they are only used for translating traps</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:43:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: monitoring templates need to be created by hands using the correct OIDs</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:43:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; by hand* rather</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:45:20] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; ok... is there a way to automate creating of the template... e.g. without web interface... it's will take too much time e.g. to manually add about 300 data sources...</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:45:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: not that I'm aware of</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:46:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: I'd imagine you could script something in zendmd, but it would probably take just as long to figure out what functions to use in the script than to do it by hand</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:46:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; what do you need 300 datapoints for?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:49:09] &lt;kobalt&gt; let me see if I am understanding this correct with this code "alarm = str(getattr(evt, "dcPwrSysDigAlrmStringValue", "null"))" if I dont have a value for dcPwrSysDigAlrmStringValue, it will set the value of alarm to null?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:49:15] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; I've finished writing of sip server monitoring utility... it returns 15 OIDs for each SIP server... I have about 100 SIP servers to monitor :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:50:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: yes</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:50:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: I usually use "Unknown" instead of "null", but whatever you like</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:51:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: and each SIP server doesn't return the same 15 OIDs?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:51:29] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: ok so second part how do I write a if then statement, I keep trying to do if alarm != "null" but it does not like that</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:51:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: I'd some something like...</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:52:02] &lt;kobalt&gt; basicly if it has a value I want to have it in my evt.summary if not I want it to skip it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:52:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; import re</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:52:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; if not re.match("null", alarm)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:53:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; obviously with a : at the end of it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:53:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; if not re.match("null", alarm):</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:53:49] &lt;kobalt&gt; do I need the import re</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:53:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:53:55] &lt;kobalt&gt; in the transform</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:53:57] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:54:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; I believe so anyways</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:54:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can try without it, but I don't think it'll work</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:09] &lt;kobalt&gt; thank you so much you just saved me a headache lol</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:11] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; rmatte: OIDs looks like:</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:11] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; .1.3.6.1.4.1.32583.1.[sip_server_number].[port].[param] , i.e.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:11] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; .1.3.6.1.4.1.32583.1.1.5060.1 - amount of active calls</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:11] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; .1.3.6.1.4.1.32583.1.1.5090.1 - amount of active calls</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:11] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; .1.3.6.1.4.1.32583.1.2.5060.1 - amount of active calls</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:12] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; .1.3.6.1.4.1.32583.1.2.5090.1 - amount of active calls</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:14] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; .1.3.6.1.4.1.32583.1.3.5060.2 - amount of failed calls</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:16] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; .1.3.6.1.4.1.32583.1.3.5090.15 - amount of rejected calls</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: no problem</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:18] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; etc.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:55:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: I see...</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:56:55] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; quick question - latest version of zenoss - how do you set units for data sources?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:57:04] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; (er, points...)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:57:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: well, there are more efficient ways than using SNMP datasources.&#160; you could use command based datasources and have a script that gathers the data based on parameters passed to the script, then just create a local copy of the template for each server and just modify those parameters</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:58:21] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; rmatte: that's exactly what I decided on doing, and it works wonderfully.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:58:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: units are set in the graph settings itself, not on the actual data points</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:58:28] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; ah,kk</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:59:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: the datapoints just contain a plan value as far as Zenoss knows</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:59:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; plain value*</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 12:59:37] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; cool deal</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:00:14] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; rmatte: this way is not sufficient for me...

sergeymasushko: I see, so you're essentially going to have like 100 graphs on one perf page?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:01:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: that's going to be a bit of a nightmare for you lol.&#160; I have like 30+ graphs on one page and there's usually a few of them that don't load when I first load the page, I then have to keep refreshing the page until they all load</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:01:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it takes a long time just for 30 to refresh</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:01:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; 100 will take a really long time</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:02:00] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt;

libzenoss/extras.tar.gz</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:19:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:20:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; mention it to Matt, maybe he can look in to why they do that</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:20:29] &lt;exarkun&gt; What's Matt's irc nick?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:23:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:23:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; Matt Ray, he's the Zenoss community manager</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:24:27] &lt;exarkun&gt; Thanks</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:24:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:27:17] &lt;cgibbons&gt; we have a source tarball? huh</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:28:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: to build from source on things like FreeBSD</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:28:33] &lt;cgibbons&gt; just surprised we have that when the svn stuff is easier to grab</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:29:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; just as easy to grab :P</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:29:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; wget </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/zenoss/zenoss-2.4.5.tar.gz">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/zenoss/zenoss-2.4.5.tar.gz</a></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:29:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; done</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:29:33] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i think the actual # of steps to go from source to working build are easier with svn :) but no matter</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:29:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; or "fetch" in place of wget if you're using BSD</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:30:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: how do you figure?&#160; the stuff you'd dump from svn is basically exactly what's in the tarball anyways :P</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:31:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I should setup a FreeBSD VM at home, haven't worked with FreeBSD in quite a while</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:37:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk for a few</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:42:32] &lt;exarkun&gt; I made a new zenpack.&#160; I installed it with zenpack --install --link.&#160; If I modify it via the web ui, can I get my changes reflected in the original source directory?&#160; I see that I can "export" it, but that seems like it would be a very inconvenient way to work (changing stuff, exporting it, re-integrating it into the source tree, repeat).</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:43:03] &lt;exarkun&gt; Or am I not supposed to try to version control things like objects.xml?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:47:33] &lt;TBKDan&gt; My zenoss box is throwing an error for localhost: "threshold of zeneventlog cycle time exceeded: current value 60.03"&#160; It's been doing this consistently for the past several weeks and I'm not sure what has changed... any ideas on what to check for?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:49:14] &lt;TBKDan&gt; And the value for the timeout fluctuates... now it's at 64.90s</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:49:35] &lt;TBKDan&gt; If I clear the event and clear the heartbeats, it comes right back.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:56:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; TBKDan: you could try setting a higher timeout value for that</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:57:46] &lt;TBKDan&gt; rmatte: Where do I set the timeout for the eventlog?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:58:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; TBKDan: go to Collectors -&gt; localhost -&gt; Edit</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:58:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll see "Event Log Cycle Interval (secs)" at the top</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:58:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; It'll probably be set to 60 or something</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:58:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; up it to 300</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:58:55] &lt;TBKDan&gt; rmatte: Is that the timeout or how often it checks the event log?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:59:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the timeout for the cycle of the zeneventlog daemon</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:59:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; cycles start every 300 seconds (every 5 minutes)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 13:59:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; so setting the timeout to 300 is fine</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:00:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can set it to 120 or whatever if you want</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:00:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; anything higher than 60</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:07:19] &lt;kobalt&gt; does anyone know if a device reports down from /status/ping will the collectors still try to collect?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:08:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: no, they won't</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:08:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: if something is ping down, Zenoss stops polling everything on it until it sees it up again</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:09:34] &lt;kobalt&gt; so if I have it set to not auto clear the up alarm will it still thinks its down because the down alarm has not been moved to history</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:09:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, it will</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:09:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; why would you not want it to auto-clear ping down events?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:10:53] &lt;kobalt&gt; we report on up and down times, due to our SLA so if it autoclears it, we dont see the time, then that create a issue if something goes down for 40 seconds and clears we would not see it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:10:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; ping down events are also used to accurately calculate availability values, so if you start messing around with the auto-clears your availability values won't be accurate either</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:11:00] &lt;kobalt&gt; and we want to see it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:11:39] &lt;TBKDan&gt; rmatte: I changed the value to 70, restarted zenoss, and I'm still getting the errors. 60.02s timeout</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:12:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; TBKDan: Devices -&gt; Manage -&gt; Push Changes</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:13:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: so you need to notify clients even if a device goes down for like 40 seconds, is what you're saying?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:13:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; correct</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:13:25] &lt;kobalt&gt; we are a very proactive noc</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:13:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: and you need to notify them about it right away, or down the road?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:13:45] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: correct</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:13:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: you have people watching the event console?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:14:26] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: we will, but not atm, we are testing out zenoss as a alternitive to hp open view</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:15:35] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: so in the time that we are using it unless we speed up the browswer refresh we would not see it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:15:51] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: and I have not found the option for that</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:16:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: why are you not just having it send email alerts to a general mailbox?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:16:34] &lt;TBKDan&gt; rmatte: 2 more timeouts since pushing changes, both just over 60s</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:16:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: we have it interfaced with our ticketing system, so when a device goes down it opens a ticket, so it doesn't matter if it clears a few seconds later, you'd need to setup something similar</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:16:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; TBKDan: try setting it to like 120</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:17:01] &lt;exarkun&gt; When I run zenctl, it writes out "Unknown id: **OS_USERNAME**" and exits.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:17:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; TBKDan: you may need to restart Zenoss afterwards</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:17:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: we montior over 5k devices, so email box would get full quickly</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:17:33] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: what ticketing system do you use</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:18:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: a customized version of OTRS</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:20:10] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: how customized did you have to do to get zenoss to intergrate with it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:20:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; the customization was more for the visuals than for anctually creating the tickets in it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:20:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; although we did customize it for certain pieces of info that it didn't support beforehand</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:20:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; it definitely wasn't simple to do</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:21:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; then we wrote a perl script which creates tickets in the ticketing systems based on values passed to it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:21:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; and we created a command to execute it for events that come in (Event Manager -&gt; Commands)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:21:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobalt: what ticketing system are you using?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:22:30] &lt;kobalt&gt; mrayzenoss, we are using RT atm but evaluating others</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:23:05] &lt;kobalt&gt; RT = Request Tracker</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:23:07] &lt;kobalt&gt; sorry</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:23:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:23:30] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I've heard of integrations with RT, haven't seen a write-up for it anywhere though</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:23:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can customize the outbound emails to conform to the ticketing system</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:24:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's in the Admin Guide</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:24:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Enterprise has a Remedy integration if you have that</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:24:26] &lt;kobalt&gt; I would be interesting in any write ups for intergration for any system, like I said we are looking at a few now, I will have to look at the admin guide for that</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:28:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; I haven't really done a writeup of ours.&#160; I'm in the process of revamping the ticketing integration anyways.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:31:53] &lt;TBKDan&gt; rmatte: Well that seems to have made the event go away. Is there any other way to resolve that other than setting the timeout that high?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:34:17] &lt;exarkun&gt; How do I get zenctl to work, instead of writing out "Unknown id: **OS_USERNAME**"?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:37:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; exarkun: looks like it's probably a port issue...</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:38:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; [27-Feb-2009 23:57:29] **MrEcho&gt; zenctl debug</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:38:16] &lt;rmatte&gt;

my fault, had something running on 8080 and 8081</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:38:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's from an old IRC log</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:38:48] &lt;exarkun&gt; Zenoss is running on port 8080 at the moment.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:38:53] &lt;exarkun&gt; I was hoping to restart it. :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:39:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; restart what?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:39:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; why are you using zenctl anyways?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:39:15] &lt;exarkun&gt; Some docs told me to I think</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:39:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:39:44] &lt;exarkun&gt; I edited the source of a ZenPack</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:39:56] &lt;exarkun&gt; I want the changes to be picked up</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:40:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so you effectively want to restart Zenoss</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:40:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:40:32] &lt;exarkun&gt; Yes</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:40:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; as zenoss user:</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:40:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenoss stop</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:40:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenoss start</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:40:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; simple</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:41:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can do zenoss restart as well, but I find it's hit or miss since there's no pause</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:41:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I like to do zenoss stop</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:41:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; then count to 3 or 5</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:41:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; then zenoss start</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:41:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; works better</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:41:41] &lt;exarkun&gt; Okay.&#160; Thanks.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:42:55] mrayzenoss1 is now known as mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:45:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:50:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, I need to go home and sleep</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:51:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; so go :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:51:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; can't, stuck here for another couple hours</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:51:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; same here</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:52:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; They have me trying out this asset management software</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:52:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, I gave the shipping department some money to pay the duties on a package that I was getting shipped here, but the guy I gave the cash to left and didn't tell anyone about it, so now I have to go pick up the parcel at the post office tomorrow, grrrr</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:52:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; asset management software, fun</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:53:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; kinda, parts of the gui are very intuitive, others are odd</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:53:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; which software?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:53:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; AssetExplorer, by ManageEngine</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:54:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, looks interesting</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:54:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; it's not bad, if you want it to do Windows stuff you have to use the windows version</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:55:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:55:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; that kind of sucks</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:55:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; is it agent based?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:55:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah, im guessing it relies on some form of WMI or RPC</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:55:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; no, WMI/RPC and SSH</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:55:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:55:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; it got a ton of info, really fast, i was kinda impressed with that part, but now im trying to do something simple</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:57:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; sounds like Zenoss sometimes, you get it gathering a bunch of info and then you try and do something which should be simple, and then the fun begins :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:57:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; doesn't happen often though</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:57:51] &lt;kobalt&gt; do class mapping override the class transforms so if I had a transform on /env but had a mapping in for that event would it ignore the /env transform?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:58:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: I believe the class based ones are actually executed last</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:59:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's how it's setup</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:59:20] &lt;kobalt&gt; hrm</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:59:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; it executes whatever transforms in order, the first one that hits wins</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 14:59:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll notice a sequence number in the event mapping</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:00:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; the order transforms execute is based on the sequence</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:02:24] &lt;exarkun&gt; I wonder what "zport" is short for, and what the common link is between the things beneath it is</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:03:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; where do you see zPort?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:03:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, you mean the zport zope object</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:03:36] &lt;exarkun&gt; Lots of places :)&#160; eg /zport/dmd/Devices/Discovered</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:03:38] &lt;exarkun&gt; Maybe so?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:03:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's just part of the database structure</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:04:15] &lt;exarkun&gt; Maybe I'm asking about that structure.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:04:19] &lt;exarkun&gt; Why is it structured like that?</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:04:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://whatever:8080/zport/manage">http://whatever:8080/zport/manage</a></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:04:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you'll be the zope management interface</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:04:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can see the structure</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:04:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; because that's the zope database structure lol</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:05:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; dmd is the device management database</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:05:26] &lt;exarkun&gt; Does zport have any siblings?&#160; Or only children?</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:05:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you go to </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://whatever:8080/manage">http://whatever:8080/manage</a><span> you'll see the root structure</span></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:05:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; though everything in Zenoss works under the zport object</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:06:15] &lt;exarkun&gt; Okay</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:10:06] &lt;exarkun&gt; Thanks</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:10:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:10:12] &lt;exarkun&gt; That clarifies a bunch of things.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:31:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; @mrayzenoss:&#160; Adium has an IRC plugin?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:32:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think it support IRC natively</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:32:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; supports*</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:32:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; Adium is basically just pidgin for OSX</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:33:48] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I'm very old fashioned when it comes to IRC, I still use BitchX</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:42:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; or irssi</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:42:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; well i'm segregating things, getting back to using the MacBook Pro as my primary machine</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:42:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:42:59] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; yeah, I've got with Adium for IRC, Yahoo, Gtalk, AIM, Facebook and Twitter</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:43:06] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt;

hehe</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:44:10] mrayzenoss1 is now known as mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:44:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; he's dedicated.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:44:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, vi or sed</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:46:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html#uh-0">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html#uh-0</a></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:46:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the funny thing is that actually works in Skype</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:46:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the Skype IM client let's you used s/blah/blahblah/</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:47:06] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I think that's it for me today though, see you tomorrow gents.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:51:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; wish I could say the same</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:51:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; got another hour :(</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:52:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:52:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; I got here really late</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:52:49] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm in Cali(forniat)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:52:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; ia)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:52:55] &lt;davetoo&gt; where it's raining quite hard</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:52:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I usually start between 9:30am and 10:00am</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:53:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I end up staying until 5:30pm or 6:00pm</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:53:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's almost 5pm</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:53:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; I usually start from home at about ...well, I have 7:00 phone meetings two or three times per week,</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:53:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wish I could work from home</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:53:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; then I come to the office, and then I usually wait until 6:30 to leave because otherwise traffic sucks too much</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:54:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; I don't get to stay at home so much any more</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:54:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:54:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; new manglement is more into appearances</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:54:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do work from home the very odd day</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:54:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, they are REALLY in to appearances here, to the point where it's a bit ridiculous lol</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:54:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; Some of my days are *very* long because I have to deal with people on day shift in India</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:54:43] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:54:49] &lt;davetoo&gt; you work on the East Coast?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:54:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; You miss a day to work from home and then everyone is up in arms about it the next day.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:55:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; the one day I was like "Well, I could just take the whole day off instead of working from home, your call"</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:55:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:55:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; there seems to be a big difference in culture between the Silicon Valley and the Silicon Gulch, or even RTP</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:55:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, eastern time</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:56:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; When sysadmins show up for interviews with ties, we laugh at them :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:56:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; but...</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:56:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; I work for Engineering, not Corporate IT.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:56:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; Corp IT is different.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:56:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I never wear ties or anything</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:56:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; stuffy.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:56:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; a golf shirt is about as casual as I get</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:56:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wore a hard rock cafe t-shirt to work today :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:56:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:57:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm wearing a company slogan shirt</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:57:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; silly team slogans and stuff</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:57:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; does Pulver ever hang out on IRC?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:57:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:57:35] &lt;davetoo&gt; Who else is having trouble with zenprocess?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:57:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; once in a blue moon</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:57:43] &lt;davetoo&gt; It just doesn't seem ... reliable</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:57:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; but it's intermittent and I can't really pin it down</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:58:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenprocess has been quite reliable for me</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:58:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I don't really know</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:58:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; where I run into trouble, mostly, is monitoring zenoss processes, or java,</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:58:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; although it's apparently exceeding cycle time for some reason, hmmm</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:58:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; i.e. when you *have* to enable parameter matching</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:58:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; (on one of my boxes)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:59:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I never do parameter matching, so that's probably why it's working fine for me</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:59:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; I wonder .. in python is it possible to manipulate $0 so that it shows what I want in ps? :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 15:59:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; I could fix it that way</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:00:13] &lt;exarkun&gt; ctypes will let you call prctl</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:00:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; I understand why they don't invoke the daemon directly; distributed collectors</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:00:41] &lt;exarkun&gt; more portable is to re-exec yourself with the argv[0] you want</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:01:04] &lt;exarkun&gt; (still doesn't get you windows support, but no one cares about that, right?)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:01:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; I only care about zenoss daemons right now :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:01:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; 'cause the Java isn't mine, and I don't grok java anyway</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:01:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; I think I'm about to start doing command plugins for these corner cases</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:01:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm monitoring lots of processes on windows servers via snmp, works fine.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:03:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; with the free Informant MIB?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:03:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, with just stock zenoss SNMP process monitoring</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:03:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; and my SNMP Performance ZenPacks</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:03:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; no informant</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:04:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; 'k, I'm so out of touch with Windows, wasn't sure what it provides</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:04:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; so you wrote a zenpack?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:04:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; erm,</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:04:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:04:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; well,</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:04:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; that's not what I meant to ask/</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:04:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; did you write a collector?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:04:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; Or just the usual custom oids and such</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:04:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, command based datasources</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:05:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; aye</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:05:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; once I have the time and knowledge I'll write a proper plugin</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:05:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3386.html">docs/DOC-3386</a></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:05:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the pack</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:05:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; I want to write something to monitor Cisco environmental sensors</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:05:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; and a simplified version of it: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3570.html">docs/DOC-3570</a></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:05:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; have to learn how to write a collector, use datamaps, and such</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:05:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:06:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; I've done some pretty hairy zenpacks,</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:06:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; my Cisco Mibs ZenPack is still the most popular one I've made :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:06:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; which are now overkill, since they were hairy to work around features not yet in zenpacks</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:06:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; Which one? The one for ASA?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:06:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, the one containing every possible Cisco Mib</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:06:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3404.html">docs/DOC-3404</a></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:07:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; for traps</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:07:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; well....</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:07:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:07:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; for traps</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:07:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; are you sure?&#160; Did you account for NX-OS? :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:07:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; NX-OS snmp for interfaces and routes is b0rked</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:08:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; be right back...&#160;&#160; or, if you're leaving, ttyl</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:08:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I downloaded all publicly available Cisco Mibs and compiled them</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:08:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; had to modify some of them so that they would compile properly</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:09:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://demonic.cc/?p=20">http://demonic.cc/?p=20</a></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:09:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what I went through to get them all to load</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:12:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; it was a pain</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:13:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; back</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:13:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; yeah, maybe I could extract your modified versions for my workstation</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:13:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure about the NX stuff, if it wansn't included in the 2 tarballs that I pulled off the Cisco site then it's not there</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:13:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; I have to redirect all of my stderr to /dev/null because I get so many compile errors</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:14:04] &lt;davetoo&gt; bad timestamps and suck</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:14:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:14:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; such</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:14:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; NX-OS is... bizarre</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:14:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never worked with any Nexus gear</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:15:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'd wait another year or two if you have the choice :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:15:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt we'll have the need for one</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:15:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok, back to my phyon...</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:15:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; have fun</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:15:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; ttyl</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:15:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup, later</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:19:43] &lt;majikman&gt; so i'm trying to monitor the number of active vs. inactive threads i have in mysql. so i modified the mysql template and added graph poitns for each of the thread statistics. thta graph worked but it was drawing the data incorrectly. what i wanted was a LAST consolidaiton. so i changed it to LAST and now when i try to load the thread statistics graphs, it gives me an error about RenderServer.py. any idea wha tthe issue is?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:20:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: sorry, never seen that before</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:21:15] &lt;majikman&gt; ok. np. i'm going to try to debug it myself... see if i can find anything</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:21:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:21:54] &lt;majikman&gt; oh... one thing if you can possibly help me. i noticed that when i edit the RenderServer.py file, i have to restart zenoss everytime for the changes to take effect. is there an easier way to see my changes take effect?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:22:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, you need to restart it since it needs to recompile that file on startup</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:22:35] &lt;majikman&gt; can i just restart one specific daemon? or do i have to restart the entire zenoss server?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:22:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; majikman: just remove the .pyc file and it'll get recompiled</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:22:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't know which daemon renderserver.py belongs to, I think it may be a zenhub file.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:23:00] &lt;majikman&gt; :q</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:23:15] &lt;majikman&gt; ahh.... thanks mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:23:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; if I had to guess rederserver.py probably belongs to zenhub</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:23:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: ah yeh, I guess it would recompile the next time it tries to access it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:25:14] &lt;majikman&gt; alright... i'll see what i can do here. thanks</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:26:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; hey mrayzenoss: off the top of your head</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:26:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; has anybody done anything to make it easier to change device production states?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:26:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; i.e. some kind of shortcut on the main/status page?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:27:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; I want to make it easier for my "users" to stop spamming me with events :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:29:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you mean other than going to the Edit tab?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:29:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you could add a custom command to do it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:30:07] &lt;kobalt&gt; is there a way to restart zopectl via command line, it seems mine stopped</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:30:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so they could just do "Run Command"</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:30:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobalt: as the zenoss user, 'zopectl restart'</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:30:29] &lt;kobalt&gt; cpp;</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:30:31] &lt;kobalt&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:30:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: you can change production states across multiple devices right from the device page</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:31:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; Device List -&gt; Checkmark the devices you want to change -&gt; Set Production State</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:31:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes;</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:31:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; what usually happens, though, is that a user gets a ticket to work on a system, and forgets to put that individual system in Maintenance before he takes it down</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:32:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: that is such an issue of people not following process.&#160; changing production states right now is quite simple to do</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:33:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: they should either be creating maintenance windows in Zenoss in advance, or remembering to do it by hand before starting their change</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:33:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; davetoo: you could modify the email template to include a URL like in this thread to remind them to set the state: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../message/27024.html#27024">message/27024</a></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:33:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; Navigating the pull-down menus is a bit tedious</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:33:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's 1 pulldown</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:33:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; and on the edit tab it's literally right there in a dropdown</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:33:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not rocket science</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:33:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:33:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; well, it is to these guys :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:34:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, hire new staff :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:34:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; What would be really cool, is if the status "portlet" with the status pills</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:34:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; could be modified such that one could set the State with a pull-down/selection box right there</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:34:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; interesting</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:34:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; just thought of that; maybe I'll read up on zpt and the like</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:35:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm out</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:35:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; later folks</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:35:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; davetoo: you could use those URLs that I linked to and modify one of the portlets to include it</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:35:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; bye</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:35:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; later</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:35:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok I'll look</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:36:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; Nobody had any feedback in the dev forum about my non-RRD zencommand idea :(</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:37:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; well, to make maintenance windows a *tiny* bit easier, I modified the Device class to add the Administration tab back</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:37:49] &lt;davetoo&gt; and zProperties</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:39:33] &lt;davetoo&gt; mrayzenoss: the starting point of my comment in the Dev forum is the fact that zCommandCycleTime doesn't do anything</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:39:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; I did create a trac ticket</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:40:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; but I think I saw you recommending it's use to people on the list a while ago and I wondered if you realize that it's defunct now</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:43:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I probably need to sit down and reread all the docs at some point :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:43:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; my problem is I don't actually have a real system to admin</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:43:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I have a bunch of sandboxes</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:44:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; right, and without a lot of variation in what you're monitoring, you don't ever run into these things</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:44:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, I try to have a bit of variation in my 10 devices at home :)</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:44:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; for example, I have a need to run an ssh command on a class of devices every minute, or maybe even every 30 seconds,</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:45:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; but no way do I need the performance data that often</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:45:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; it's just a health check on a critical/buggy system</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:46:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; right now I'm working on it from the other direction; I'm going to run something on the servers and send a trap or maybe use syslog.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:46:41] &lt;davetoo&gt; but it's only through a lot of cajoling from the vendor that I have shell access on these appliances</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:46:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; won't always have the ability to do that.</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 16:48:46] &lt;majikman&gt; so deleting the .pyc file didn't seem to help with that... i needed to restart zope to get it to load the new file</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:01:22] &lt;majikman&gt; ok, so i think i figured out what my issue is. my rrd files are being generated incorrectly. any idea where the code is that generates the rrd files?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:01:41] &lt;davetoo&gt; generated?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:01:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; sorry, I missed the start, what are you trying to do?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:02:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; The Collector defines the default rrd creation params</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:02:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; how are they "incorrect"?</span><br/><span><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:03:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; Look at </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://">http://</a><span>&lt;yourhost&gt;/zport/dmd/Monitors/Performance/localhost/editPerformanceConf</span></span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:06:00] &lt;majikman&gt; davetoo, ahh.... ok, thats the issue. the default rrd create command is AVERAGE</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:06:21] &lt;majikman&gt; my issue was that the consolidation function I need is last so it was throwing errors</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:07:00] &lt;majikman&gt; where do we submit feature requests?</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:10:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; dev.zenoss.org</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:10:44] &lt;majikman&gt; ok thanks</span><br/><span> [13-Oct-2009 17:10:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

but everywhere else they are alphabetical</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 00:08:21] &lt;MorkBork&gt; is there some way i can rearrange them or do i have to readd the groups/systems in the order i want?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 07:16:03] &lt;Dieterbe_&gt; guys, if you use httpmonitor and your times are always like &lt;50ms and size is 1k+, how can you show both lines so that you can see them both? my response time is always a flat line on the bottom</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 07:19:55] &lt;ckrough&gt; You either need to use a multiplier against the time so that they are within range of eachother, or make a reeeeealy tall graph</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 07:20:16] &lt;ckrough&gt; Making two seperate graphs is probably "the way".</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 07:25:50] &lt;patzer&gt; I thought maybe rrd could do two y-axis, one at each end</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 07:25:57] &lt;patzer&gt; but might be confusing with another graphing library</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 07:27:22] &lt;ckrough&gt; That would be ideal. I haven't seen that in RRD though.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 07:27:53] &lt;patzer&gt; yeah, it's there</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 07:27:58] &lt;ckrough&gt; nice</span><br/><span><span> [14-Oct-2009 07:27:58] &lt;patzer&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdgraph.en.html">http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdgraph.en.html</a><span> -&gt; "Right Axis"</span></span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 07:28:17] &lt;patzer&gt; not exactly that, but it will draw a second axis transformed by a multiplier with a new label</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 08:32:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; hah</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 08:32:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; pebkac</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 08:32:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; things to to wear to work in this economy</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 08:49:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; morning</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 08:50:36] &lt;ckrough&gt; hello</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:00:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; good morning</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:13:54] &lt;exarkun&gt; When I run zendmd on the command line, I get this warning</span><br/><span><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:13:58] &lt;exarkun&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m40672ad7">http://pastebin.com/m40672ad7</a></span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:14:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's harmless, ignore it</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:32:36] &lt;alinux&gt; can zenoss caputure a remote tcpdump ?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:35:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; what do you mean?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:35:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; alinux: what are you trying to accomplish?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:37:38] &lt;alinux&gt; rmatte, got 12 servers, and one monitoring server, I want to be able to see the network streams of the 12 servers on the monitoring server when i need to</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:42:59] &lt;exarkun&gt; Page 41 of the developer's guide describes the "ToOne" relation.&#160; It documents the 3rd parameter to its initializer as 'The third parameter is a "string" object, "remoteName" which the remote name of itself.' which doesn't seem to be grammatically valid.&#160; What is it trying to say?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:46:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; positional arguments are evil</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:47:48] &lt;exarkun&gt; I don't think that's what it's trying to say.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:47:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; I have created a relation exactly once, so I don't know a lot, but this might help you find the answer: it seemed as if both sides of the relation needed to be created .. not exactly simultaneoulsy, but in a single transaction,</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:47:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; (I know, sorry)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:47:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; so...</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:48:37] &lt;davetoo&gt; what I think I saw was that both ends are referenced in each relation.. constructor call?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:48:55] &lt;exarkun&gt; Are there one-way relations?&#160; I don't actually need a two way relation, I don't think.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:49:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; In other words, you have to provide context for the other end of the relation to get back to you</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:49:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; good question, I haven't gotten that far yet, sorry</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:50:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; one would hope so</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:51:10] &lt;exarkun&gt; I haven't found any examples of a one-way relation in the zenoss code yet.&#160; Having it be two-way isn't the end of the world, though, as long as it doesn't apply some constraint that I don't want...</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:51:21] * exarkun makes some educated guesses and observes the consequences</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:52:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; what are you working on/with?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:52:33] &lt;davetoo&gt; are you trying to do this in the ZMI or zendmd or ?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:54:43] &lt;exarkun&gt; I'm... writing a data source that has an arbitrary script as one of its fields</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 09:55:24] &lt;davetoo&gt; yeah?

rmatte, what is the next best thing ?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:21:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; alinux: Zenoss is a monitoring solution for performance and stuff like syslogs and snmp traps, it's not designed for heads up monitoring</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:21:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; alinux: no idea, you're looking for some sort of dashboard to show tcpdump streams, quite honestly you'd probably have to have something custom coded for that, I've never heard of any tool that supports that type of functionality</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:22:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; Finisar stuff can show several remote probes, but it's not an agent on a GP O/S</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:22:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; alinux: Zenoss is also agentless, and what you're asking for would most likely need to be done with agents</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:22:57] &lt;exarkun&gt; Hm, now I think my ZenPack is totally broken.&#160; My data source page won't render anymore.&#160; My ZenPack won't export.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:23:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; either agents or via ssh</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:24:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; exarkun: try restarting Zenoss then exporting</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:24:37] * davetoo wonders if there is a Force10 zenpack</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:24:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; what rmatte says; especially if the zenpack list says that it's broken</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:25:36] &lt;exarkun&gt; Done that a few times</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:25:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; exarkun: are you receiving errors when trying to export?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:25:59] &lt;exarkun&gt; The way the export fails is with an AttributeError for "exportXml" on something related to the relation I'm trying to define</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:26:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; then it's most likely a problem with the code</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:26:42] &lt;exarkun&gt; I have little doubt.&#160; Only the small matter of /what/ the problem is remains.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:27:20] &lt;exarkun&gt; I don't find that the documentation is complete enough for one to actually extend the model, at least not without lots of trial and error.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:28:13] &lt;exarkun&gt; Maybe I can still uninstall the ZenPack, though.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:29:36] * exarkun blinks</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:30:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; sometimes we can't :(</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:30:48] &lt;exarkun&gt; I managed to.&#160; And then when I tried to re-install it, zenpack told me about an ImportError that has apparently been in the code for quite some time now, but which never got reported anywhere else.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:31:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok, I need to buckle down on other work for a bit</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:31:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; ttyl</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:44:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; woot, dev sesh!</span><br/><span><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:44:27] &lt;adel&gt; hello, i'm trying to make a ssh zenpack with this doc : </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2381.html">docs/DOC-2381</a></span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:46:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; adel: ok, what kind of device are you looking to monitor?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:50:42] &lt;adel&gt; I tried to monitor a percraid card installed in a dell server with opensolaris as the OS.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:51:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so you want to update the OpenSolaris SSH ZenPack?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:51:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; to support that?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:52:17] &lt;adel&gt; No, i try to build a specific zenpack for that because i don't really understand how the opensolaris zenpack is working.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:53:37] &lt;adel&gt; I have installed it is not easy to understand how it works.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:54:05] &lt;adel&gt; But i try to study it.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 10:59:32] &lt;adel&gt; so i follow the instruction on how to build a zenpack but the modeler don't find my ssh modeler command ...</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:00:30] &lt;adel&gt; I don't know how to be sure that the modeler is using the good zenpack.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:02:27] &lt;adel&gt; the zenmodeler -v10 doesn't give the information about the path he is using.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:03:19] &lt;adel&gt;

i tried also to add a very simple ssh test but this try wasn't a success. I'm not a beginner under linux (15 years), i developp sometimes in python ...</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:26:51] &lt;adel&gt; but i have a really big problem of understanding with the zenoss documentation.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:27:14] &lt;adel&gt; :-(</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:29:45] &lt;adel&gt; somebody can help me before i give up ?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:31:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; have you looked at the other ZenPacks as examples?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:31:22] &lt;adel&gt; I look the OpenSolaris Zenpack.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:31:55] &lt;adel&gt; it is little bit quite complex.</span><br/><span><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:32:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the contents of </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://zenpacks.zenoss.org/trac-zenpacks/browser/zenpacks/ZenPacks.community.OpenSolaris/ZenPacks/community/OpenSolaris/modeler/plugins/zenoss/cmd/solaris">http://zenpacks.zenoss.org/trac-zenpacks/browser/zenpacks/ZenPacks.community.OpenSolaris/ZenPacks/community/OpenSolaris/modeler/plugins/zenoss/cmd/solaris</a><span> are the zCollectorPlugins</span></span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:32:28] &lt;adel&gt;

I've got to run to a meeting, but there will be a developer in the channel tomorrow</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:39:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the Celerra ZenPack takes a shell call and uses it to modify the model</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:39:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; gotta run</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 11:42:20] &lt;adel&gt; ok thanks</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:20:38] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; is it possible to run a zenoss collector within a lan and post to an external zenoss installation?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:22:59] &lt;ckrough&gt; depends on your bandwith and access controls</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:27:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: theoretically yes, provided it's setup correctly</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:31:00] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:36:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; building a custom device report</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:36:30] &lt;twm1010&gt; trying to come up with a query, that shows me all device that have property less than a certain date</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:36:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; so i added the custom property of cPurchDate</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:37:14] &lt;twm1010&gt; trying to use here.cPurchDate &lt; 2004/01/01</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:41:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; I highly doubt that you can do that...</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:41:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd need to convert the dates to epoch time</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:41:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; then do the comparison</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:41:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, the attribute type is "date"</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:42:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; well is the RHS a 'date' type also?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:42:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just don't think you can do &lt; to a date</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:42:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; I could be wrong</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:42:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; would be nice if it did :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:42:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; i was being optomistic :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:42:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; In my experience you'd need to convert the dates to epoch time, once that's done then you can do the comparison</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:43:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; tangent: I *wish* we could add custom properties/schema to other organizers.&#160; I really need it on Systems and Groups, too.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:43:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; I can do it in the ZMI, I guess :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:44:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; davetoo: i could see that being useful</span><br/><span><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:44:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: check this: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.epochconverter.com/">http://www.epochconverter.com/</a></span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:44:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; scroll down to "Convert from human readable date to epoch"</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:44:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; and check the Python line</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:44:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; What I really want to do is put the purchase date of the device in there, and create a report that will always show you devices that are 5 years old, 7 years old etc.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:44:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'll tell you what I want to do with them: apply performance template bindings based on Group and System tags, as well as /Devices class</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:45:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: still need to use epoch time values to perform the actual comparisons :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:46:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; You can import python libraries in the Query box</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:47:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; considering i've never touched python, this should be a fun learning experience</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:47:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; I think</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:47:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes it will :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:48:15] &lt;twm1010&gt; so... i need to query the current date, from the zenoss server, then read the attribute, and produce a list of machines where the delta of that is &gt; 5 yrs</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:48:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok, I'm wrong</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:48:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; sorry,</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:49:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; looks like it takes only simple expressions</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:49:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: in what query box?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:49:29] &lt;davetoo&gt; custom device report edit</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:53:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:54:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, the custom report edit is extremely limited</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:54:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll need to write some custom python script to get what you want</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:54:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; (I've had to write a bunch)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:56:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; and have it kick that off? over my head :|</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:56:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, the script would literally have to do everything and you'd have to execute it from commandline</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:57:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's no way to use the built in custom report editing to get what you want</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:57:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; that custom report editor is for generating extremely simple reports</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:57:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; gotcha</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:57:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's basically for generating device inventory reports with whatever fields you need, that's about all it can do</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:58:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; easier just to let the report grab everything and just use excel</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:58:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you can do that too</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 12:58:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not much of an excel guy</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:01:02] &lt;kisielk&gt; how do I connect to the mysql database ?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:01:09] &lt;kisielk&gt; I wanted to check out some of the queries that are running</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:06:17] &lt;kisielk&gt; nevermind, got it</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:06:30] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; mysql -D events</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:06:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and -u root</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:08:14] &lt;twm1010&gt; I never realized that the process monitoring tracked CPU and memory usage for the process until just now</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:10:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; too bad it doesn't auto associate a process with a winservice</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:10:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; so you don't have to monitor both and get two events</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:39:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: log a feature request in Trac</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:46:34] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; anyone here use zipec? (zenoss console for iPod/iPhone)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:46:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: nope, haven't tried it out</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:47:03] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:47:07] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; it's php based</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:47:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know of it</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:47:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's just a web app</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:47:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; formatted to look good on the iphone browser</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:47:32] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; was wondering if anyone knows if it's possible to include it in a subdir of zenoss</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:47:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you configure apache to look there for the web files</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:47:50] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; instead of running a separate web server for it</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:47:54] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; hmmmm</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:47:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, I doubt it</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:48:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss runs on Zope</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:48:08] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; eah</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:48:10] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; *yeah</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:48:32] &lt;ckrough&gt; doesnt look like you can ack from the phone...</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:48:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to run a separate web server for zipec</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:48:44] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; hmm, coolcool</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:48:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should still allow you to ack events and stuff?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:48:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, it's a PHP read-only view of the events</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:49:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, read only</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:49:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's not super useful :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:49:25] &lt;ckrough&gt; I want to tap so I stop getting alerted on my way to a console</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:49:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; nope, I've heard rumblings from 3 separate people about working on iPhone interfaces, but nothing has reached maturity</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:49:54] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:50:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ckrough: yeah, acknowledging events would be handy</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 13:54:39] &lt;patzer&gt; why would a schema not be found when extending the model?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:04:36] mrayzenoss1 is now known as mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:45:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; patzer: extending the model?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:45:52] &lt;exarkun&gt; Hm I kept hoping that the data source config page was automatically generated from _properties or _relations.&#160; I guess not though.&#160; I have to write a... .pt file?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:46:05] &lt;exarkun&gt; A skin?&#160; with tal?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:46:36] &lt;patzer&gt; rmatte: I have developed a modeler which polls a device and creates the objectMap objects out of that info</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:46:50] &lt;patzer&gt; but I am still getting errors when trying to model...</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:47:10] &lt;patzer&gt; first it was a SchemaError but now I have moved on to a TypeError</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:47:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; TypeError is almost certainly an issue in your code</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:47:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; one of the variables is most likely not the right type</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:48:16] &lt;patzer&gt; "Remote exception: exceptions.TypeError: poolName() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)"</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:48:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, you're passing too many arguments to the poolName() function</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:48:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; apparently</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:48:48] &lt;patzer&gt; I don't have a poolName() function for starters</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:49:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; then the function is sitting in some script that the modeler is calling on somehow</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:49:07] &lt;patzer&gt; the stacktrace goes to:</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:49:16] &lt;patzer&gt; File "/local/zenoss-stack/zenoss/Products/DataCollector/ApplyDataMap.py", line 287, in _updateObject \ setter(*args)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:49:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you compared your plugin to others?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:49:58] &lt;patzer&gt; yes I am basing it on the RDBMS one</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:51:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I don't really have experience with writing collector plugins, so I can't be of much more assistance</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:56:41] &lt;kobalt&gt; if an interface type shows up as ethernetCsmacd and not ethernetCsmacd_64 is there anyway to bind the 64 template to it, in this case its a gig port and its not pulling the data for graphs properly</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:56:54] &lt;exarkun&gt; At least I know how the names in factory_type_information are resolved now</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:56:56] &lt;kobalt&gt; if I snmpwalk the device it says its a ethernetCsmacd(6)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:58:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: you would have to make a local copy of the ethernetCsmacd template on the interface and then manually modify the template to match the ethernetCsmacd_64 template, I don't really know of any other way</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:58:54] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok, well that sounds .... fun lol</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:59:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte,&#160; do I have to delete my existing RRD files, or just leave them as they are</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:59:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: you could also temporarily move the ethernetCsmacd template to some other name, rename the ethernetCsmacd_64 template to ethernetCsmacd and then create all the local copies you need, then move ethernetCsmacd back to ethernetCsmacd_64 and move whatever you renamed ethernetCsmacd to back to ethernetCsmacd</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 14:59:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: I don't think you have to delete the RRDs</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:00:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; the interface template system definitely needs to be revamped at some point, it's quite limited</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:00:36] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, will the fa interfaces work with the 64 bit counters?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:00:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: doubt it</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:01:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm surprised that the gig port isn't showing up as ethernetCsmacd_64 though</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:01:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you tried remodelling?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:01:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've heard of ports initially showing up as ethernetCsmacd and then showing up as ethernetCsmacd_64 after a remodel</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:01:57] &lt;kobalt&gt; if I walk the device it shows up ethernetCsmacd</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:01:57] &lt;whitemice&gt; I'm trying out ZenOSS (long time OpenNMS shop).&#160; Everything seems ok... but the paging command sends me a page every minute until the event is acknowledged. And I get no clear event;&#160; but the e-mail side works perfectly. Version 2.4.5</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:02:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:02:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; that sucks</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:02:36] &lt;kobalt&gt; yeah not sure why</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:02:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's more of a case of the device reporting crap info</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:02:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:03:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; whitemice: you have a repeat time set on the paging alert</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:03:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; whitemice: set the repeat time to 0 and it'll only page you once per event</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:03:27] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, yeah and my engineers will say fix your montiroing software lol</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:03:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: probably, just make the local copy and do it that way I guess, is it just the 1 port?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:04:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, I have about 20 interfaces the same way</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:04:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:04:46] &lt;whitemice&gt; it is 0</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:05:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; then follow my suggestion of briefly renaming the 64 bit to ethernetCsmacd, create the local copies you need, then move everything back to how it was</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:05:14] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, or more lol, I dont want to lower the collect time, only have about 460 devices so far (not all of the network yet)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:05:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; whitemice: rhyme of the settings for the alert please</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:05:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; off*</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:06:32] &lt;whitemice&gt; rematte: rhyme?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:06:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; just say what settings you have</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:06:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; starting with default command timeout</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:07:43] &lt;whitemice&gt; rmatte: delay 0, enabled true, action page plain text true, repeat 0, send clear true,</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:07:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually hold on, I'm looking at a command, I'll make a test alerting rule</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:08:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:09:13] &lt;whitemice&gt; for now, just testing our page command is just "/bin/mail -s"zenoss" $RECIPIENT" and the pager number is the cell carriers SMTP gateway addresss </span><a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:XXXYYYZZZZ@vtext.com">XXXYYYZZZZ@vtext.com</a></span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:09:13] &lt;whitemice&gt; the messages come through - they just don't stop. :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:09:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure, that's odd</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:10:17] &lt;whitemice&gt; it is kind of maddening!</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:10:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; that may be a bug</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:10:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't use the pager feature, so I can't really test</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:11:02] &lt;whitemice&gt; ok, I'll post a message to the forum</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:11:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:11:30] &lt;whitemice&gt; So far ZenOSS seems really nice, certainly easier to configure than OpenNMS;&#160; but kind of twitchy.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:11:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's getting better though</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:12:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; it was way twitchier a year ago</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:12:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:15:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; Once stone crab rolls around the whole interface will be revamped, and then they'll be focussing on things like reports and overall stability</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:15:47] &lt;whitemice&gt; any time line for that?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:15:57] &lt;whitemice&gt; NMS is kind of important to us :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:16:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the next release, which is King Crab, is due near the end of the month...</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:16:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; then stone crab is due approximately 6 months after that</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:16:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; they have a 6 month release cycle for major releases</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:16:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; with maintenance releases in between</span><br/><span><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:17:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; here's what the interface will look like in stone crab: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://public-demo.zenoss.com/evconsole">http://public-demo.zenoss.com/evconsole</a></span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:17:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; just to give you some idea</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:18:08] &lt;whitemice&gt; hmmmm, maybe I should just go back to OpenNMS.&#160; Sigh.&#160; OpenNMS is just a pain-in-the-ass to configure.&#160; But solid as a mountain.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:18:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's up to you lol</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:18:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never really worked with OpenNMS much</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:20:32] &lt;whitemice&gt; Was at Ohio LINUX fest. ZenOSS guys are persuasive.&#160; And they throw a nice party. :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:21:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:22:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I heard the party was quite a hit</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:22:26] cgibbons_ is now known as cgibbons</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:22:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've tried OpenNMS out myself, I just didn't really like the way that it presents the data</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:22:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; the interface feels congested</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:22:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; it certainly does have some nice features though</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:24:52] &lt;whitemice&gt; you can't configure a *@^&amp;@ thing via the interface, you spend your time plowing through horrid XML files.&#160; And thresholds?&#160; I'd rather chew glass than do that again.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:25:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:25:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, Zenoss make device template configuration very easy</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:25:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; especially thresholds</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:25:45] &lt;whitemice&gt; take the ZenOSS UI (they are talking about revamping it?) and drop it on the OpenNMS engine = Perfection!</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:25:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:26:08] &lt;whitemice&gt; sadly I live in this world where that hasn't happened. :(</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:26:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, Zenoss is getting a lot more stable lately though</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:26:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; how many devices are you monitoring?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:26:55] &lt;whitemice&gt; The call to /bin/mail to send the page is failing with "IOError: [Errno 4] Interrupted system call".&#160; Found that in the logs.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:27:15] &lt;whitemice&gt; OpenNMS: ~100 devices.&#160; ZenOSS has about 20 configured so far.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:27:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:27:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; the call to send the page is done as the Zenoss user</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:27:33] &lt;whitemice&gt; so not huge.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:27:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, I'm monitoring over 340 devices on one of my Zenoss servers</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:27:50] &lt;whitemice&gt; But I do get the page (message).&#160; That is what seems wierd.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:28:07] &lt;exarkun&gt; The /bin/mail process almost certain succeeds</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:28:10] &lt;exarkun&gt; Then it exits</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:28:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe that's why you keep getting paged, because it sees that the command failed and retries</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:28:25] &lt;exarkun&gt; In exiting, the system sends a SIGCHLD to the parent process (some zenoss daemon I guess)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:28:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenaction would probably be what's calling the command</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:28:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; or zencommand</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:28:53] &lt;exarkun&gt; The SIGCHLD interrupts a system call in the parent process - probably waitpid(), maybe read()</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:29:07] &lt;exarkun&gt; Interrupted, the syscall fails with EINTR (Errno 4, Interrupted system call)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:29:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:29:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; then Zenoss probably tries the command again</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:30:07] &lt;exarkun&gt; So Zenoss (or whoever it turns out is responsible for that syscall which is being interrupted) needs to be changed to handle EINTR and take the appropriate action (which is often to re-try the syscall that failed)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:33:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; whitemice: just out of curiosity, why didn't you just leave the pager command as the default?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:33:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; $ZENHOME/bin/zensnpp localhost 444 $RECIPIENT</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:33:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; chances are that would work a lot better</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:34:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; Usage: zensnpp &lt;snpphost&gt; &lt;snppport&gt; &lt;recipient&gt;</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:35:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's actually designed to work with Zenoss so chances are if you use it you'll avoid that error</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:36:43] &lt;exarkun&gt; Hooray, custom markup on a Zenoss web page.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:36:46] &lt;whitemice&gt; what does it do?&#160; there is nothing about it in the admin guide or on the server itself (man page).&#160; I get that it sends pages;&#160; how? where?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:36:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; whitemice: it sends a page</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:37:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; let me see if I can find something</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:37:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, it is listed in the admin guide from what I see</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:38:21] &lt;whitemice&gt; as the default sure;&#160; but it doesn't say anything about it.&#160; I put the default back and ran a test - it posts a failure "Test failed: socket.error - (111, 'Connection refused') "</span><br/><span><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:38:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="DOC-3044.html#d4e5612">docs/DOC-3044#d4e5612</a></span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:38:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; voila</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:38:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:39:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; it is pretty under-documented though</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:39:23] &lt;whitemice&gt; yea, that is the same thing as the admin manual</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:39:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; that is the admin manual</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:40:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you even try it at all with the default?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:41:13] &lt;whitemice&gt; nah,&#160; we use Verizon. I know what SNPP is,&#160; we don't have SNPP.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:41:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:42:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, maybe you need to write a script which calls on the mail command and have Zenoss call on the script instead</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:42:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; anyways, I guess we'll see if anyone on the forums has any suggestions</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:42:37] &lt;whitemice&gt; I'll try that (although honestly I don't see how that is different that just calling /bin/mail)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:43:31] &lt;whitemice&gt; got one response so far.&#160; Maybe it is helpful.&#160; But the link doesn't go anywhere specific.&#160; (from my browsing I think the forum breaks just about every link,&#160; most go nowhere or just straight back to the forum.&#160; really frustrating).</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:43:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you sending the pages to an email address?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:43:39] &lt;whitemice&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:43:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; then why not just configure a regular email alert with plaintext?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:43:55] &lt;whitemice&gt; Verizon has a SMTP-&gt;SMS gateway.&#160; With Verizon you have no other options.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:44:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't see why you're even bothering with the pager command</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:45:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're basically reinventing the wheel since Zenoss is already fully capable of sending emails via SMTP</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:45:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:45:23] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, well that did not work the device does not accept the 64 bit counter.... anyway to have it collect at a specific cycle for a device or is that global</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:45:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: global</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:45:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: well, it's collector specific</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:45:50] &lt;whitemice&gt; the paging does seem to send a short form of the message;&#160; and the user also gets e-mail alerts.&#160; It appears a user can only have one e-mail address.&#160; Hmmmm. maybe I can figure something out.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:45:51] &lt;TBKDan&gt; Is there a way to temporarily disable monitoring of a device?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:46:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; whitemice: ah</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:46:30] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, ugh I really dont want to collect from 460 devices every minute lol</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:46:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; whitemice: buy blackberries :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:46:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: that would probably blow up lol</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:47:57] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, yeah average of about 30 ports per device, Im amazed its doing this well with every 5 minutes</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:50:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 15:54:26] &lt;kobalt&gt; so any other suggestions on these graphs</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 16:03:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: I'm out of ideas</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 16:04:39] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, so I looked at my zenperfsnmp logs and its polling all my interfaces in 49 seconds... hrm do I lower the cycle time and take the extra load</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 16:05:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; well that wont work</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 16:05:33] &lt;kobalt&gt; I just looked again and that time it took 86 lol</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 16:05:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, cycles times vary</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 16:06:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; cycle times*</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 16:33:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; woohoo, tomorrow is payday</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 16:33:40] * rmatte does a dance</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 16:43:00] mrayzenoss1 is now known as mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:44:49] &lt;markeriv&gt; anyone here atm?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:44:57] &lt;markeriv&gt; got a not so easy question</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:45:28] &lt;markeriv&gt; i am monitoring T1 routers that are doing nat</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:45:54] &lt;markeriv&gt; and have the same private LAN IP address.&#160; This is preventing me from monitoring something locally that shares the same LAN subnet as another site...&#160; is there any way to get around this?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:46:33] &lt;markeriv&gt; should I delete the lan interface for monitoring on that device or...</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:49:27] &lt;kobalt&gt; the only way I would suggest as we do is we have it staticly mapped</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:49:27] &lt;kobalt&gt; err natted</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:49:57] &lt;kobalt&gt; so your moniting a differnt ip at the zenoss box then what it has</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:50:00] &lt;kobalt&gt; if that makes sense</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:50:14] &lt;markeriv&gt; hmm, well i managed to delete the conflicting interface, but it bothers me that i cannot monitor two devices with the same lan ip</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:50:15] &lt;markeriv&gt; &gt;.&gt;</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:50:27] &lt;markeriv&gt; there are an awful lot of 192.168.1.x's out there</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:52:40] &lt;kobalt&gt; yeah we monitor like 17 networks we see a lot of 10.0.0 networks</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:53:24] &lt;markeriv&gt; welcome davetoo</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:53:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; uh</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:53:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; hi</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:54:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; 'bot?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:54:06] &lt;markeriv&gt; negatory</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:54:10] &lt;markeriv&gt; this is not a bot</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:54:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; :)&#160; just surprising</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:54:17] &lt;markeriv&gt; a bot could not possibly be as awesome as I</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:54:32] &lt;markeriv&gt; anyhow</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:54:34] &lt;markeriv&gt; whats happening?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:54:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; don't know yet, that's why I'm here</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:54:53] &lt;markeriv&gt; ahh</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:54:59] &lt;markeriv&gt; well, got any Qs?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:55:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; to see what people are talking about today :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:55:10] &lt;markeriv&gt; ahh</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:55:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; Nothing simple enough for me to take the time to get into right now</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:55:41] &lt;markeriv&gt; well i am talking about how zenoss is having a network conflict dealing with a shared private network address</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:56:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; there is an Enterprise feature that deals with that</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:56:03] &lt;markeriv&gt; and refusing to let me monitor the 2nd device on that private network without some wrangling</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:56:08] &lt;markeriv&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:56:22] &lt;markeriv&gt; well, i got around it by deleting the conflicting interface on teh remote machine</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:56:43] &lt;markeriv&gt; however i think i could also get around it by creating some port forwards and monitoring a public IP assigned to that private</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:56:53] &lt;markeriv&gt; since my boss does not want to pay out the mouth for enterprise</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:57:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; but what do you use as the Management IP for the device?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 17:57:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; You'd have to pretty much completely subvert the discovery and modeling processes</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 18:36:43] &lt;kobalt&gt; davetoo, so enterprise has to ablilty to monitor overlaping network spaces?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 18:44:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; IP Realms, but I haven't tried/had to use it yet</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 18:56:13] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; kobalt: yes</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 18:56:48] &lt;kobalt&gt; mrayzenoss1, that is a positive, does it do at this point any type of netflow</span><br/><span><span> [14-Oct-2009 18:57:08] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/product/plixer-scrutinizer">http://www.zenoss.com/product/plixer-scrutinizer</a></span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 18:57:40] &lt;kobalt&gt; mrayzenoss1 I am evaluating zenoss as a monitoring solution for my company and so far it looks good just a few issues I need to figure out</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 18:57:48] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; that integration is available in Enterprise, there has been some talk about making it available to all users.&#160; It's Plixxer's call</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 18:58:31] &lt;kobalt&gt; mrayzenoss1, that is nice, that could be a good selling point for my boss</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:02:34] &lt;kobalt&gt; mrayzenoss1, can you answer a sales question? the platinum subscription for 180 a year is that per seat, per server?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:02:47] &lt;kobalt&gt; if you dont know no biggy</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:03:02] mrayzenoss1 is now known as mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:03:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; per device</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:03:23] &lt;kobalt&gt; so if I have 2250 devices its 180 each??</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:03:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; but that number comes way down with large installs</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:06:01] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok im out of here, talk to you tomorrow</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:11:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; bye</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:12:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; man, the kids over in #python are sometimes not helpful</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:12:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; plixer? a new product?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:12:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh, collaboration</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:12:49] &lt;davetoo&gt; never heard of them</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:13:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; I need to find somewhere I can talk about/explore python OO Design Patterns without being told "that's dumb" :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 19:17:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 20:22:04] &lt;kobalt&gt; question, if I create a second collector and set like 5 devices to it, and have the zenprefsnmp set to 60 seconds instead of the normal 300, I would not need to do anything else would I? I did that and it seem the new collector is not collecting snmp traffic data</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 20:30:11] &lt;kobalt&gt; I guess collectors is the wrong word, I set up a second monitor and set certian devices to it and then set the time to a different cycle interval</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 20:30:15] &lt;kobalt&gt; does that work</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 20:54:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; collector is an ok word</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 20:55:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; did you change the default RRD create command?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:15:55] &lt;kobalt&gt; no I didnt</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:15:59] &lt;kobalt&gt; do I need to do that</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:16:02] &lt;kobalt&gt; and how lol</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:19:40] &lt;kobalt&gt; davetoo, let me see if I can find the rrd create command</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:22:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; it's in the Edit page for the Collector</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:23:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; are you running Enterprise?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:23:52] &lt;kobalt&gt; no just core</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:25:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; What technique are you using to run multiple collectors?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:25:07] &lt;kobalt&gt; unfortunally I have no experiance with RRD so not sure what this command should be changed to</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:25:22] &lt;kobalt&gt; I go to collectors and hit the down arrow and say new</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:25:24] &lt;davetoo&gt; search the zenoss forums, I think there is a HOWTO somewhere</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:25:35] &lt;kobalt&gt; name it then add the devices to that collector</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:28:33] &lt;kobalt&gt; I found a script from Chet that does it for you</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:28:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; I figured Chet was involved somehow :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:36:58] &lt;kobalt&gt; we will see if that works</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 21:43:52] &lt;kobalt&gt; do you know what snmp map grabs the interface listing like descr and index etc</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:00:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; ifTable</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:01:33] &lt;kobalt&gt; right but what collector get that info</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:01:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; do you know python at all?

that is doing *all* of your devices</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:13:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; I hope you ran it in a screen(1) session :)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:14:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; Have you deleted the device and re-added?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:14:10] &lt;kobalt&gt;

hi folks - i have a job running on one of my hosts that spikes the CPU on one of our machines every hour... i want to suppress teh CPU utilization errors.&#160; I can't just 'ack' the cpu spike, because it clears when the jbo ends, the event goes away (CLEAR), but comes back an hour later.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:33:01] &lt;eidolon&gt; how do i say "stop monitoring cpu load on this machine" ?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:39:07] &lt;kobalt&gt; eidolon, you can remove the threshold for that machine</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:39:27] &lt;kobalt&gt; by going to the device in zenoss then going to more template</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:39:27] &lt;eidolon&gt; can't quite find the path to that.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:39:53] &lt;eidolon&gt; okay, in more template, now on Device / MSSQLServer</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:40:01] &lt;eidolon&gt; i'll need to cerate local copy, yes?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:40:02] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok hit create local copy</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:40:05] &lt;eidolon&gt; and then edit it?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:40:07] &lt;kobalt&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:40:10] * eidolon gets it!</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:40:14] &lt;kobalt&gt; then remove the threshold</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:40:15] &lt;kobalt&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:41:26] &lt;eidolon&gt; hmm, no, i don't want ot turn off the data source, because i want to keep logging it, right?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:41:39] &lt;eidolon&gt; just not alert on it</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:41:52] &lt;kobalt&gt; correct if you set the threshold to fals</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:41:56] &lt;eidolon&gt; hmm.</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:41:59] &lt;kobalt&gt; false it wont alarm</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:42:06] &lt;eidolon&gt; right, but it will collect data, right?</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:42:10] &lt;kobalt&gt; correct</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:42:14] &lt;eidolon&gt;

(it's like 11:45pm here, i have no brain, jiust beig cautious)</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:43:09] &lt;kobalt&gt; no</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:43:19] &lt;kobalt&gt; threshold high cpu</span><br/><span> [14-Oct-2009 22:43:20] &lt;eidolon&gt;

mrayzenoss: a forum post requesting topics to be covered ahead of time might be good</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:00:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: well, the issue with that is that the person requesting that a topic be covered should really be here to be able to have a back and forth</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:01:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; otherwise, you can just post on the forum and wait for a response on the forum itself</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:01:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; it accomplishes just as much</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:02:11] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt;

There's no sign of the old contents anywhere.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:23:21] &lt;jb&gt; &lt;OperatingSystem at /zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Windows/devices/wrxxcrpmoss01.corp.follett.com/os&gt;</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:24:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; jb: don't indent the second line</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:25:06] &lt;jb&gt; ah yeah</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:25:09] &lt;jb&gt; dumb me.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:25:11] &lt;jplouis&gt; yeah, that will do it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:25:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:25:21] &lt;jb&gt; doesn't look like the processes are there that I have deleted</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:25:34] &lt;jb&gt; also, the alerts haven't came back again since I restarted zenprocess</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:25:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, maybe that's all you needed was one last restart</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:25:59] &lt;jb&gt; perhaps</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:26:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; give it a bit and see if the alerts come back</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:26:19] &lt;jplouis&gt; zenprocess isn't the best at getting device updates/changes</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:27:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenprocess really need quite a bit of work in my opinion, it's really the weakest link right now in terms of snmp monitoring</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:27:05] &lt;jplouis&gt; some of that has changed in zenprocess for 2.5; hopefully they will make zenprocess respond to changes in a timely manner</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:28:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; indeed</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:32:24] &lt;cgibbons&gt; zenprocess is not my favorite, either :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:35:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:36:50] &lt;exarkun&gt; Anyone have any other ideas about my skin question?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:44:44] &lt;jplouis&gt; I got nothing, reinstalling the zenpack and restarting zenoss(zope) should reload the skin</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:45:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; maybe a pack to remove deleted objects?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:46:53] &lt;exarkun&gt; I'll try it.&#160; How do I do a pack?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:47:47] * exarkun opens the admin guide</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:48:15] &lt;exarkun&gt; ah, zenpack.py, okay</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:48:30] &lt;andrewp&gt; Can anybody here help w/ HTTPMonitor ZenPack?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:48:47] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, I found what my 32 vs 64 bit counters issue was.... an access list lol</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:49:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; andrewp: what do you need help with?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:49:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: snmp access list you mean?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:50:19] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, yeah the zenoss server didnt have access to the ifHcInOctects mibs</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:50:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup, that'd do it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:50:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:50:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; told you it sounded like more of a device issue</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:50:41] &lt;kobalt&gt; fix that and Im on my way</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:50:44] &lt;kobalt&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:50:45] &lt;andrewp&gt; I'm having an issue with it not properly "de-duplicating" events.&#160; It seems like one HTTP monitor clears the events of another.&#160; So therefore if a site is down for an hour, no matter what the check interval is, it always shows the event count as 1</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:50:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; good stuff</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:51:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; andrewp: which version are you running?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:52:26] &lt;andrewp&gt; Zenoss version 2.4.5 HTTPMonitor version 2.0.1</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:53:33] &lt;andrewp&gt; The idea is that I want to put an alerting rule so it takes a couple of timeouts for me to get a page, but with the count always being "1" that currently does not work.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:54:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; And it works fine when you're only testing one url?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:54:42] &lt;jplouis&gt; httpmonitor uses zencommand?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:56:11] &lt;andrewp&gt; I haven't tried testing one URL, but I've tried putting in a special event eventclass for each monitor.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:56:30] &lt;andrewp&gt; I think it uses zencommand - the nagios CHECK_HTTP script</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:56:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; jplouis: yes, it does</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:57:59] &lt;jplouis&gt; and the special eventclass for each datasource didn't work?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 10:58:42] &lt;andrewp&gt; No,, it didn't.&#160; And I can actually see the "clear" messages come through before it immediately generates another event.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:00:16] &lt;jplouis&gt; hmm, there is a patch for zencommand; it may apply to this case</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:01:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; exarkun: is that 2.4.5 or 2.5?</span><br/><span><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:02:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; jplouis: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5494">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5494</a><span> ?</span></span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:02:52] &lt;jplouis&gt; yep, that one</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:03:02] &lt;andrewp&gt; hmm. that does look awful suspect</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:03:14] &lt;jplouis&gt; patch number is [15003]</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:03:34] &lt;andrewp&gt; I'll definitely give that a try! Thanks!</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:05:04] &lt;exarkun&gt; mrayzenoss: 2.4.5</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:07:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; wasn't that one patched in 2.4.5?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:08:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; I thought that 2.4.4 addressed Jane's ticket then 2.4.5 addressed 5494?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:08:50] &lt;exarkun&gt; Maybe the way I'm developing my data source (what the skin is associated with) is wrong.&#160; If I want to change the implementation of a data source that's already been instantiated in a Zenoss server, what do I need to do?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:16:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I really don't know... what are you trying to do exactly?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:21:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; exarkun: if you were to write up what your issue is in detail (a lot of detail) along with what exactly you're trying to accomplish and a list of errors that you are experiencing, then post it on the forums you would most likely have better luck</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:22:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; offering up a cash reward for a solution tends to work as well :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:24:13] &lt;exarkun&gt; I posted one question to the forums.&#160; I might post some more.&#160; Maybe I'll get an answer at some point.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:26:15] &lt;exarkun&gt; I don't think I'm doing anything unusual.&#160; In fact, I haven't really /done/ anything yet.&#160; I have a custom data source class that has no behavior at all.&#160; I have a skin file that's 1 line long.&#160; I'm still figuring things out, but I'm having a lot of trouble with the workflow.&#160; For most projects, I start writing some tests, I implement stuff until they pass, and repeat.&#160; That doesn't seem to apply for ZenPack development.&#160; At least not any of the parts I'v</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:28:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I've done ZenPack development and I've never gotten in to what you're trying to do, so I can't personally offer much assistance</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:29:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wish I did have the time to actually study zenpack development in more depth</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:29:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the only custom data sources I'm aware of are from Egor... WMI, WBEM and ODBC</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:30:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, thought the WMI pack completely breaks in King Crab</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:31:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I'd imagine WBEM and ODBC packs break as well</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:31:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; s/thought/though</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:31:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; ...and I doubt he'll have time to fix them before the King Crab release</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:31:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I can see that being a bit of an issue for a lot of people</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:31:53] &lt;exarkun&gt; I haven't looked at those data sources yet.&#160; I probably should, I'm sure that will help me understand important stuff.&#160; But since they're "finished" products, they don't really tell me anything about development workflow.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:32:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we're trying to get a Beta 5 out today, maybe I can get Egor or someone to look at how they get broken in 2.5 and get them fixed ahead of time</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:33:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; mrayzenoss: that would be nice, WMI datasource keeps me on 2.4.x until thats squared away</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:33:50] &lt;cgibbons&gt; the WMI one only breaks because he was using a common daemon collector that zenwin &amp; zeneventlog used; they both got rewritten in 2.5 to use the new collector framework, so that common class was removed. but the datasource, etc. stuff should still be fine.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:35:47] &lt;Bad_Religion&gt; hi all</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:37:52] &lt;Bad_Religion&gt; is it true that setting device properties like devs._setProperty("zSnmpProtocol", "UDP") defaults to type=string?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:42:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; Bad_Religion: I would imagine so</span><br/><span><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:48:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; more zenprocess issues: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../message/40763.html#40763">message/40763</a></span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:48:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:59:23] &lt;andrewp&gt;&#160; FYI I just applied the patch and it fixed my issue with HTTPMonitor.&#160; Thanks guys!</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:59:49] &lt;markeriv&gt; hmm hello again</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 11:59:57] &lt;markeriv&gt; i am afraid my issues with fping have returned</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:00:03] &lt;markeriv&gt; and i am puzzled by them O.o</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:01:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; andrewp: cool, good to hear, I don't remember whether or not I applied that patch, I'll have to check hehe</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:02:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: Zenoss keeps a record of what patches have been applied to it somewhere?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:02:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, in Products</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:11:51] &lt;kobalt&gt; for some reason after correcting the permissions for 64 bit counters I have a couple devices that stopped graphing its not drawning a graph at all</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:12:56] &lt;kobalt&gt; any ideas?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:24:47] &lt;RoundQube&gt; hello all</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:24:54] &lt;RoundQube&gt; i cannot use the community edition for corporate use correct?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:25:07] &lt;jb&gt; yes, you can..</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:25:17] &lt;RoundQube&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:25:25] &lt;jb&gt; you just wont get the enterprise zenpacks or enterprise support</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:25:31] &lt;RoundQube&gt; im trying to find a doc via google search as to the limitations or differences, can you point me to one?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:27:01] &lt;tbozz&gt; Anyone know why the filesystem template would be sending a critical for a disk spaceat 95.1% when the threshold is set to .98?&#160;&#160; I do have the transform to show disk space usage in a human readable format.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:30:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: basically, you don't get any enterprise ZenPacks, which provide things like full WMI monitoring support, simple LDAP setup (thought LDAP authentication can still be configured in Core), simple distributed collector setup (Which is possible in Core with a fair amount of work), VMWare monitoring, stuff like that</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:30:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: you also don't get the enterprise grade support from Zenoss, you need to rely on community support</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:31:07] &lt;ckrough&gt; tbozz: not sure if its related to your issue (the numbers dont add up) but linux snmp returns free disk space including the 5% reserved for root, whereas linux tools exclude it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:31:21] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte so gneral monitoring can be gained from community edition without tearing out my hair?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:31:39] &lt;tbozz&gt; ckrough: I do remember seeing that, however this is on a windows box</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:31:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: define general monitoring</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:32:04] &lt;tbozz&gt; I have a warning for 95% and 98% for critical</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:32:14] &lt;tbozz&gt; but it just goes critical at 95</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:32:16] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte servers icmp, disk/mem/cpu usage</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:32:30] &lt;RoundQube&gt; bandwidth etc..</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:32:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you're doing all of the monitoring via SNMP, then yes</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:33:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; core also supports event log monitoring and services monitoring via WMI, but that's about all it supports</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:33:13] &lt;RoundQube&gt; what options are there outside snmp?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:33:35] &lt;RoundQube&gt; ill give it a go and see if its a fit, otherwise i have yet to still try nagios</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:33:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: that's about it in core to cover everything you described</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:33:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: core can not monitor disks via WMI</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:34:05] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte cool, i'll try it via snmp. what are the adv of wmi?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:34:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: you can monitor linux servers via ssh</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:34:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; adv?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:34:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, advantages?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:34:23] &lt;RoundQube&gt; advantages</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:34:25] &lt;RoundQube&gt; yes =)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:34:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; WMI is developed by Microsoft, so you can pull data via WMI much easier than via SNMP, though SNMP works better in my opinion (more stable)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:35:12] &lt;RoundQube&gt; will give it a shot, i heard Zenoss is easy to setup and get goign with</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:35:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; there is a catch, windows' SNMP service really really sucks at reporting CPU and memory usage, so I wrote ZenPacks for doing SNMP performance monitoring (CPU and Memory)</span><br/><span><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:35:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; This is the simple version of my pack, for just monitoring overall CPU usage (doesn't monitor each individual core): </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3570.html">docs/DOC-3570</a></span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:35:59] &lt;RoundQube&gt; but i cannot use those zenpacks with my community edition?</span><br/><span><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:36:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; This is the advanced one for monitoring each core: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3386.html">docs/DOC-3386</a></span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:36:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can use them because they aren't enterprise zenpacks</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:36:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are community zenpacks</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:36:24] &lt;RoundQube&gt; ok</span><br/><span><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:36:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; There's a ton of community ZenPacks available: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="community/zenpacks">community/zenpacks</a></span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:36:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; some are very good, and some aren't very good</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:36:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:36:48] &lt;tbozz&gt; ckrough: I think I figured it out, looks like the transform was overwriting the threshold and was setting any over 95% to critical with no warning section.&#160; I added a section for warning and changed critical to 98</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:36:52] &lt;tbozz&gt; I will see how that works</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:36:53] &lt;RoundQube&gt; cool, thanks</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 12:36:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 13:12:26] &lt;tbozz&gt; yea that fixed it.&#160;&#160; Sweet :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 13:12:37] &lt;exarkun&gt; Can someone who has done any development for or on Zenoss tell me how you work?&#160;

i don't like the source tarball :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 13:53:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; me neither, I work off of SVN</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 13:53:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: well, all that data is stored in RRD files, so you really just need to tap in to those files and display the data</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:03:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: read up on using RRDtool to display data</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:05:19] &lt;exarkun&gt; Okay, this is too much</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:05:49] &lt;exarkun&gt; I uninstalled Zenoss, deleted /usr/local/zenoss entirely, re-installed from the debian package, re-installed my zenpack, created my data source</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:05:54] &lt;exarkun&gt; And it still uses the old template</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:08:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, if you wiped everything I don't even see how that's possible</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:09:14] &lt;twm1010&gt; how is that even possible</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:09:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; are you sure your web browser doesn't have a page cached or something</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:09:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010++</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:10:36] &lt;twm1010&gt; I mean I can understand zope hanging onto deleted objects or something weird like that, but if you delete the database and install it again, its impossible</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:10:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I'm guessing it's something cached</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:10:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; clear the cache or try doing shift-refresh</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:10:46] &lt;ckrough&gt; Does browser cache claim another victim?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:10:46] &lt;exarkun&gt;

nope</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:11:07] * exarkun clears the cache anyway</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:11:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; how could that be possible?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:11:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not possible lol</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:11:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless there issue is actually IN the zenpack itself</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:12:10] &lt;exarkun&gt; cache cleared, same page</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:12:31] &lt;exarkun&gt; The skin just has the string "CONTENT GOES HERE" in it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:12:38] &lt;exarkun&gt; That string doesn't appear anywhere in the ZenPack anymore</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:13:22] kevin7kal_ is now known as kevin7kal</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:14:10] * exarkun greps the zenoss directory for it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:14:54] &lt;exarkun&gt; uhg</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:15:11] &lt;exarkun&gt; hits</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:18:53] &lt;exarkun&gt; So templates.pt includes the exact same string as my original template</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:19:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, because that's the template file</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:19:23] &lt;exarkun&gt; What does that mean?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:19:34] &lt;exarkun&gt; templates.pt is generated from ZenPack-supplied templates?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:20:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; gotta run, be back in an hour</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:20:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, let's say you want to restore a zenpack to development mode...</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:20:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can do...</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:20:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; cp $ZENHOME/Products/ZenModel/ZenPackTemplate/* $ZENHOME/ZenPacks/ZenPacks.community.YourZenPack-1.0.2-py2.4.egg/</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:20:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; that effectively copies those template files in to your zenpack directory</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:20:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are also automatically copied when creating a new ZenPack from the gui</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:20:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's their purpose</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:21:44] &lt;exarkun&gt; But that's not where my skin file came from.&#160; I created it from scratch.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:22:19] &lt;exarkun&gt; I think it was just a really unfortunate coincidence that we both picked the same string.&#160; And that my template was never being used at all, it was always templates.pt.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:22:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; Is there a way to hide the legend in a graph?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:22:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: you mean in Zenoss?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:23:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; Yes</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:23:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; can I put a custom definition in that hides the legend entirely</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:23:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: you'll see an option called "Has Summary"</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:23:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; change that from True to False</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:23:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I believe that will hide it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:23:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; nah, that gets rid of the current/min/max entries</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:23:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; the datapoints still show</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:23:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:23:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:24:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; what if you go in to the graphpoint properties and clear the Legend field?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:24:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; then it resources to the graph point name</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:24:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; err.. resorts</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:24:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:24:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmmm, weird, I always assumed there was an option to do that...</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:25:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; sounds like a feature request :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:25:54] &lt;twm1010&gt; i mean if you look at the graph commands, it looks pretty easy, i'm sure there is an option</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:26:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; so perhaps i just copy/paste the "graph commands" tab into the graph custom definition</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:26:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; and add theline that kills the legend</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:26:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, I'm sure it's very simple, they just haven't implemented it for whatever reason</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:26:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could try that</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:27:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should still log a feature request for that</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:27:35] &lt;jb&gt; rocket?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:27:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt rocket is around, he's been crazy busy lately</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:28:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; hah, that worked</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:29:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: good stuff</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:29:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; just add --no-legend to the custom definition</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:29:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; it appends the custom to whatever you've defined previously</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:33:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, that's cool</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:33:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; still, that would be nice to have as a toggle in a dropdown</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:34:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; seeing as it's so braindead simple</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:37:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; sure, where would i submit that?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:38:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh</span><br/><span><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:38:53] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I thought that communities thing was just for autodiscovery</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:45:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; no wonder half my traps don't arrive :O</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:45:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; zSnmpCommunities is really only used for autodiscovery</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:45:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; zSnmpCommunity is used for overall monitoring</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:45:44] &lt;suprsonic&gt; k</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:46:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; wait, so if a trap community from a device and the monitoring community don't match, trap is discarded?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:46:01] &lt;suprsonic&gt; yeah, that was set</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:46:03] &lt;suprsonic&gt; still no worky</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:46:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: as far as I know, yes</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:46:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: otherwise there wouldn't even be a reason to set an snmp string on the traps</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:47:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; I hadn't found a use to set such a string yet, honestly.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:47:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: you sure you don't have something somehow filtering the trap port?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:47:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; I don't use traps all that much</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:47:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; check $ZENHOME/log/zentrap.log</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:47:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: I use traps a lot</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:47:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: 90% of the monitoring we do is via SNMP</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:48:00] &lt;suprsonic&gt; oh</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:48:01] &lt;suprsonic&gt; this is odd</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:48:19] &lt;suprsonic&gt; oh</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:48:28] &lt;suprsonic&gt; think I got it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:48:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:48:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; what was it?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:48:35] &lt;suprsonic&gt; let me confirm</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:49:02] &lt;suprsonic&gt; well, the zenoss host is using localhost to send traps to itself</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:49:06] &lt;suprsonic&gt; let me try a remote host</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:49:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, I've never tried actually monitoring the actual localhost with Zenoss lol</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:49:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; no real point in doing that in my opinion</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:50:11] &lt;suprsonic&gt; heheh it was my first host to monitor&#160; :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:50:16] &lt;twm1010&gt; sure there is, don't you want to know the performance of your zenoss box? what about a failed disk?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:50:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; i suppose syslog should pick that stuff up tho</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:50:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: ummm, and if that disk fails, all the data you gathered goes out the window since the disk failed on the box that you're doing the monitoring from :P</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:51:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; well a disk in a raidset now running in parity mode :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:51:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: we have 1 remote zenoss server monitoring all of the other zenoss servers in our datacenter environment, then we have 1 server in the datacenter environment monitoring the remote server</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:52:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; nice, all zenoss core?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:52:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:52:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I manage like 10 Zenoss core boxes right now</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:52:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; with more to come</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:52:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's pretty crazy keeping them all up to date</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:53:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; Funny, I was making some progress with it then out of nowhere my sup tells me he wants to give some other products a try. He wants a point, click, done, solution.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:53:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, have fun finding one</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:53:36] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm hoping now that we're getting e-commerce reporting statistics out of it that he'll be unable to shut it down.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:54:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; The whole point click done thing doesn't really exist when it comes to server and network monitoring</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:54:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can't possibly have 1 product capable of monitoring EVERY type of product out there in a single click</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:54:27] &lt;ckrough&gt; if we had just finished ZenPonies.egg sooner!</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:54:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I like the Zenoss approach of offering flexibility</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:54:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; MOAR PONIES!</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:55:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; Yeh, it takes some time to develop device templates and stuff in Zenoss, but once it's done it's done, and you can monitor literally anything with it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:55:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; Yep, I can't seem to get that past some</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:55:42] &lt;ckrough&gt; zope/python is a big hurdle</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:55:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; Yeh well, when you have non-technical people making technical decisions, you usually end up wasting time and money</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:55:54] &lt;ckrough&gt; particularly zope for me. feels like a black box</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:55:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hope your bosses have fun with their hunt for another product lol</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:56:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: I'm getting the hang of zope and it's not super bad, definitely could be improved though</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:56:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: they'll be moving to a newer version of zope and python by Stone Crab I believe</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:56:40] &lt;ckrough&gt; are they conducting this search with or without a budget. there are plenty of others out there but they cost $$$ and arent terribly impressive</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:56:43] &lt;patzer&gt; zenoss could use to have a more verbose example I think</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:57:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; patzer: what do you mean?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:57:05] &lt;ckrough&gt; we dropped "Enterprise" packages in favor of zenoss</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:57:11] &lt;patzer&gt; I am attempting to make my own stuff for it too, and it's much more time consuming than anticipated</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:57:37] &lt;patzer&gt; rmatte: just that the developer's guide is not that clear in many places</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:57:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; patzer: well, it's time consuming to learn how to do it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:57:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; patzer: once you know though, it's fairly quick</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:57:58] &lt;patzer&gt; it keeps giving example code, but in small amounts generally, hard to see the big pictures</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:58:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; patzer: and I agree, the development guide doesn't even cover half of what it should</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:58:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; patzer: I find it helpful to download other people's zenpacks and code and see what they've done</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:58:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; patzer: that's how I've learned a lot of what I know</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:59:02] &lt;patzer&gt; yes that's helpful, but they are NOT documented in the detail a tutorial should be</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:59:23] &lt;patzer&gt; and again they're from 3rd parties</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:59:39] &lt;patzer&gt; anyway, it's not insurmountable, just very slow going</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 14:59:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I don't think they are meant to be full blown "tutorials" so much as tidbits of information to assist in development</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:00:03] &lt;patzer&gt; and perhaps what I need to do is just slow going anyway, perhaps beyond what is generally done</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:00:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; they assume that the person reading already has development experience</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:00:25] &lt;patzer&gt; but no one reading will have *zenoss* development experience</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:00:36] &lt;ckrough&gt; or Zope most likely</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:00:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; true, but if you have some good python experience then you'll pick up on it quite quickly</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:01:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; play around with zendmd for a couple of weeks and you'll get the hang of it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:01:05] &lt;patzer&gt; I disagree, my problems are not python problems at all</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:01:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; what about us n00bs who just want some nice reporting ? :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:01:39] &lt;patzer&gt; they are zenoss model problems, I still don't really understand the architecture that well</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:02:03] &lt;exarkun&gt; I can echo most of what patzer has said.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:02:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: I've been hacking away at reporting for months now trying to get something half way presentable lol</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:02:03] &lt;ckrough&gt; I think they need some detailed tutorials (videos?) that hand hold you through creating a common zenpack, including modeling, templating, alerting, and reporting</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:02:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: and I don't even consider myself that advanced from a developer's perspective</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:02:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: agreed</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:02:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: it would be really nice to see something like that</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:02:59] &lt;patzer&gt; ckrough: yes, I'm just saying it would be very helpful to have a full example that is very detailed in explaining all the bits</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:03:17] &lt;ckrough&gt; exactly</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:03:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; Sure. My background is from a Windows/NetWare admin perspective though. I am cutting my brain on Linux and scripting at the same time. I'm a lot better than I was a year ago. Perhaps I should take a whole programming course at one of the colleges here.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:03:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; patzer: yeh, that's basically what he meant</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:03:59] &lt;ckrough&gt; twm1010: thats a whole lot of stuff to absorb</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:04:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yeh, see, I started using FreeBSD when I was 14 and started using Linux in College about 6 years ago, so I've had a LOT of exposure to unix type operating systems, which definitely helps</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:04:57] &lt;suprsonic&gt; and your prefered platform is?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:02] &lt;exarkun&gt; All the non-zenoss experience in the world won't help a developer know how to develop for zenoss, though.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; Ubuntu Linux</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; at the moment</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; So... I mean I make my way around decently, but scripting makes me go crosseyed in general.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:12] &lt;suprsonic&gt; booooo</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:18] &lt;suprsonic&gt; FreeBSD ftw!</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:23] &lt;ckrough&gt; here comes the war :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:27] &lt;suprsonic&gt; rofl</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:31] &lt;suprsonic&gt; no but seriously</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: well, I don't really use FreeBSD much anymore lol</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:35] &lt;suprsonic&gt; traps still no worky</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:47] &lt;exarkun&gt; The developer guide is a good start.&#160; Hopefully people are actively working on expanding it to cover what it's missing.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:05:55] * ckrough is a closet debian lover in a RHEL world.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:06:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: I do still like BSD, but I don't use it at work, and I run Ubuntu on my desktop PC at home, though I run Gentoo on my home server which is very BSDish</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:06:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: do a tcpdump and see if they are even coming through</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:07:03] &lt;suprsonic&gt; they are</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:07:11] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I've confirmed that via tcpdump already</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:07:18] &lt;twm1010&gt; Hey I'm on a Mac, that kinda puts mein the FreeBSD corner doesn't it?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:07:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so check $ZENHOME/log/zentrap.log as I suggested earlier</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:07:33] &lt;suprsonic&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:07:37] &lt;suprsonic&gt; looking at that now</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:07:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: technically it puts you in the Darwin corner, which is based on FreeBSD</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:07:54] &lt;suprsonic&gt; its so odd</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:07:59] &lt;suprsonic&gt; still only showing localhost entries</span><br/><span><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:08:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system</a><span>)</span></span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:08:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: it's possible that some of Zenoss' default event mappings are filtering the traps that are coming through</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:09:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: you could try restarting zenoss</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:09:08] &lt;suprsonic&gt; k</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:09:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; what kinds of traps are coming through?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:09:20] &lt;suprsonic&gt; coldstarts</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:09:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; are they coming in with high enough severity to be displayed</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:09:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, those should come in unfiltered by default</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:09:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; try restarting Zenoss, see if it helps</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:09:51] &lt;suprsonic&gt; zen.ZenTrap: Queueing event {'manager': 'localhost', 'timeout': 180, 'device': 'localhost'...</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:10:03] &lt;suprsonic&gt; just did that also rmatte</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:10:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm coldstarts aren't classified</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:10:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, if you're actually getting traps from localhost but not from the outside then it has to be some sort of funky network related issue</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:10:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you running a firewall on that box?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:10:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; it should just show it right there in the events console as unknowns</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:10:47] &lt;suprsonic&gt; well crap</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:10:53] &lt;suprsonic&gt; now it did register</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:10:55] &lt;suprsonic&gt; wtf</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:10:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; LOL</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:11:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: no, they aren't, they should just come in as "snmp trap coldStart"</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:11:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; or whatever</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:11:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so after the restart it's working?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:12:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; "This is the iRack as we intended....... mission accomplished!"</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:12:33] &lt;RoundQube&gt;

status shows blue (event 1)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:13:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: it takes 3 polling cycles for the graph to populate</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:13:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; each polling cycle is 5 minutes</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:13:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; so 15 minutes before they start populating</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:13:25] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte ok ill wait</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:13:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:13:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: so are you using remote collectors or full blow remote servers?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:13:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: no remote collectors, just a bunch of standard Zenoss core servers</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:14:22] &lt;suprsonic&gt; mrayzenoss have an rc script for zenoss?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:14:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are running in VMs on a couple of very beefy blades</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:15:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: when an event comes in, Zenoss automatically opens a ticket in our ticketing system</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:16:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: I'm actually working on a python daemon which will be watching for events then opening tickets and automatically moving the events to history after tickets have been opened for them</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:16:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; the way we're doing it right now is by using the Event Manager's Commands tab</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:17:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; but when 300 events come in at once it launches 300 ticket create scripts simultaneously which rapes the VAM</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:17:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; s/VAM/VM</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:17:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; the daemon I'm writing opens 1 ticket at a time until the event console is empty</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:18:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm considering for simplicity's sake to just move all my e-commerce to a remote server</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:20:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; ow, just got a papercut under my finger nail</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:20:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; (was opening a parcel)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:24:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; woot, got the replacement lens for my paintball mask</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:25:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; yeah, we really need better event flood/alert flood management tools.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:25:30] &lt;ckrough&gt; rmatte: Tipp A-5, upgraded cyclone, freak kit, 6800ci remote, e-trigger</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:25:34] &lt;ckrough&gt; rmatte: what are you running</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:25:35] &lt;davetoo&gt; We need "summary" events at the Device, System, and Group levels.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:25:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: yeh, we're going to be developing a system for that, right now it's called "SEC" and it's just an idea at the moment</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:25:55] &lt;davetoo&gt; dude</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:26:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: ...</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:26:29] &lt;davetoo&gt; you're using Simple Event Correlator, or writing something new with those initials?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:26:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; because I have had the idea to use SEC in the back of my mind for quite a while</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:27:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; just wasn't sure how to hook it into the events system</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:27:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: Ego SL74 Aurora, Dye Rotor, Virtue Crown, 68/4500 Ninja</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:27:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: sounds like you're more of a woodsballer?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:27:48] &lt;ckrough&gt; rmatte: aye</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:27:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, I like woodsball but I play more speedball</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:28:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: yeh, Simple Event Correlator, but we're not sure if we're going to actually use that or write something totally from scratch</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:28:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: either way it's going to work hehe</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:29:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; I was goofing around last weekend, calling zensendevent from a transform to create a new summary event</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:29:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: I'm tempted to get an A5 setup at some point for woodsball</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:29:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: Have you seen the apex barrels/tips for the A5?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:30:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: hehe, yeh, I don't think transforms are really the way to go in this particular case</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:30:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; I had a very vague concept of running SEC as a network daemon, not sure how I'd do that</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:31:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; maybe could wrap it in some Twisted stuff</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:31:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; which I'm just barely becoming aware of</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:31:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, once we start working on our SEC layer I'll be sure to let you know what we come up with</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:31:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; I have an A5, sitting in a box</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:31:36] &lt;twm1010&gt; I bought it and all my friends quit playing</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:31:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; this is important to me, though :) So if you need help/testing, please let me know</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:31:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; :(</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:31:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: don't play much? lol</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:32:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm going to have to come up with something on my own RSN, so I could keep you updated on what I find/do.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:32:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; but then I got back into motorcycle racing, major $$ drain</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:32:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: oh well, just go and walk on to fields and play with other people, after a while you'll have new friends to play with</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:32:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; oooh</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:32:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; fuck</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:32:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; twm1010: want to by my track sv650?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:32:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; :(</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:32:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; I just bought one,HAH</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:32:37] &lt;davetoo&gt; (sorry for the f-bomb ... I'm just depressed that I haven't been on the track in 18 months)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:32:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: sounds good, I'd appreciate that</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:33:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; 2000 sv, 2005 engine FCRs, Leo Vince exhaust, cam swap,</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:33:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: meh, occasional swearing in here isn't really frowned upon</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:33:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; 2005 gxsr750 front end</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:33:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: just don't develop a case of verbal diarrhea</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:33:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:34:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; rmatte: now that we're doing Enterprise, the alert management will be even more critical.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:34:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; what do you mean by "doing Enterprise"?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:34:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; Many of the support guys dislike Zenoss because of past alert floods</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:34:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; Zenoss Enterprise bringup</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:34:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:34:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:34:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd love to get my hands on Enterprise hehe</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:34:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'd make my job so much easier</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:35:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; previously, each of five sites had their own system and the alerts went only to the local site.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:35:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; instead I spend my days hacking features out of core that are already available in enterprise</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:35:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; Now we have a NOC (in Bangalore) who are going to get all the level-1 stuff</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:35:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: you could still basically do that, just group the devices by site and set the alerts by site</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:35:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, I see</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:36:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes, and I'm going to do that for a little while beginning next week, as a way of getting out of "fixing" my current 2.4.2 Core system :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:36:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:36:37] &lt;davetoo&gt; Just port those devices to our "beta" Enterprise system</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:36:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; just one?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:36:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have 10 2.4.5 systems to maintain :P</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:37:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; I only have to maintain the two at my site;</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:37:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:37:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; but I wrote the giant monolithic zenpack that standardizes them all</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:37:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; which I'm now un-knotting into smaller components</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:37:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I remember the good old days when I only had a lab box to work with</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:37:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; then I started getting good at Zenoss and then suddenly we went prod with it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:37:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; and here we are</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:37:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:37:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; 2.4.x is much better behaved than previous versions</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:38:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; much fewer false-positives and daemons out in the weeds</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:38:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, quite honestly the version I've liked the most in the last releases was 2.3.3</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:38:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; as soon as I hit 2.4.1 the problems began</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:38:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; tho zenperfsnmp and zenmodeler sometimes seem to do nothing when I run them by hand.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:38:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; although I've managed to stabilize 2.4.5 with some patches</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:38:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's decent for the time being</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:38:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:39:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; what did you patch?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:39:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; one sec...</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:39:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; I've only been doing python for about three months now, just to support Zenoss</span><br/><span><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:39:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="blogs/ryanmatte/2009/09/28/patching-hardwaresoftware-info-bug-trac-ticket-5473">blogs/ryanmatte/2009/09/28/patching-hardwaresoftware-info-bug-trac-ticket-5473</a></span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:40:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; 'k</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:40:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I've been learning python over the past 9 months (although I've really just started getting really good at it over the past couple of months) specifically to customize Zenoss</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:40:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, that patch resolved a HUGE thorn in my side</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:40:37] &lt;davetoo&gt; Right now I'm trying to figure out how to implement the Factory Pattern :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:40:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh,</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:40:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; wasn't able to manually set product info for devices</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:40:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I had engineers screaming at me over that left and right</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:41:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; what really got me started though was writing a parser for Cisco NX-OS</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:41:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; rmatte: ZMI :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:41:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; (but not for anybody but us super-admins)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:41:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; ZMI didn't really help</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:41:48] &lt;cgibbons&gt; there's an example of the factory pattern in the 2.5 zenoss code if you want another reference point, davetoo</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:41:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; go in to ZMI and try to set product info</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:42:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; cgibbons: where?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:42:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; I've been meaning to understand how Zenoss determines "products" and "vendors" and why somtimes it shows an OID and sometimes not.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:42:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; it sets the product info by linking to the products object rather than creating a product object, so there's no way in ZMI that I could find to do it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:42:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; I assume this information comes from SNMP</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:42:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; I see factory-related stuff in the class attributes</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:42:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; _properties and such</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:43:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; twm1010: that's my understanding,</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:43:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; though maybe some of the command/ssh modeler plugins can do it too</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:43:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; rmatte: oh, yeah, relations are a bit confusing</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:43:37] &lt;cgibbons&gt; look in Products/ZenCollector/daemon.py at lines 150-152. abstract factory for extending the framework. look in Products/ZenCollector/__init__.py for how the abstract factory is registered.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:43:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; so when it detects an OID for a vendor, its because the OS vendor info isn't already a part of Zenoss</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:44:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: correct</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:44:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; the registration part is what I was trying to figure out; how to avoid violating the Open-Closed Principle</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:44:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; or in the case of net-snmp host it's because I didn't set the sysObjectId OID so it uses the net-snmp generic one</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:44:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; i.e. how to avoid going back and modifying a previously "finished" class each time I add a new subclass</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:46:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; cgibbons: thanks</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:47:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; is zope.interface only interesting to Java programmers? :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:47:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; I've never used a language that had interfaces, just sort of faked it with abstract classes</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:47:53] &lt;cgibbons&gt; 'old python' didn't really use interfaces, it's more common now</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:47:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; and multiple inheritance</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:48:01] &lt;cgibbons&gt; interfaces are OO goodness</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:48:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; well, not really</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:48:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; 'k I'll look into it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:48:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; interesting... the serial # of a device is clearly available via SNMP</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:48:35] &lt;twm1010&gt; why doensn't zenoss grab that?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:48:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; twm1010: only sometimes</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:48:45] &lt;cgibbons&gt; obj-c calls them Protocols; I think the name originally came from Smalltalk</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:48:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; it's inherently vendor-dependent</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:49:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; cgibbons: I learned OO in Perl :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:49:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; so I probably have a lot of un-training to do</span><br/><span><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:49:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; davetoo: here's my scooter: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://mcnicholas.smugmug.com/photos/677153636_DViYt-L.jpg">http://mcnicholas.smugmug.com/photos/677153636_DViYt-L.jpg</a></span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:49:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; but I read a lot of Booch and other Gang of Four folks</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:50:01] &lt;RoundQube&gt; is snmp informant tied to Zenoss somehow? if I install it on my server, how does zenoss communicate with it?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:50:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; nice</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:50:30] &lt;twm1010&gt; snmp informant extends the standard windows SNMP aent</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:50:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; zenoss then uses OID's that informant makes available to get disk/cpu/memory usage</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:50:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; make sense?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:50:58] &lt;RoundQube&gt; so i just install and no configuration... right now i have my device setup in zenoss for my domain server but im not getting any info, this fixes that issue?</span><br/><span><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:51:02] &lt;davetoo&gt;

i've only had the SV a week, haven't tracked it yet</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:52:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:52:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; do you hang out in #motorcycles on EFNet?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:52:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; RoundQube: Hrmmm.... well without informant, you should get SOME information</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:52:37] &lt;twm1010&gt; but informant will let zenoss in its default configuration get a bunch more information</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:52:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; Did you mean that its not getting much info from your Domain Controller?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:52:59] &lt;RoundQube&gt; twm1010 its stuck sayiing CPU at 90% and no other graphs, i've set the Zproperties for user/pass</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:53:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; nope</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:53:18] &lt;RoundQube&gt; twm1010 not much info from the domain controller, correct</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:53:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; the zProperties for user/pass by default is only used to retrieve the event log, and running services</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:53:25] &lt;RoundQube&gt; ill install snmp informant now</span><br/><span><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:53:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: well, you don't really need snmp-informant, just need to perform a bit of magic: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3570.html">docs/DOC-3570</a><span> </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3386.html">docs/DOC-3386</a></span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:53:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; or use his zenpacks :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:54:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; I need some time to convert the scripts in my packs to python</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:54:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; but they do work quite nicely as is</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:54:19] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte so i should use your pack instead of installing snmp-informant?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:54:33] &lt;RoundQube&gt; nevermind, read the first line in your description lol</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:54:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: you need to install the SNMP service on your windows servers that you want to monitor</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:54:37] &lt;twm1010&gt; you could go either route, i don't mind informant.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:54:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; theres pretty much zero overhead to it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:54:58] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte i already have that and set the IP in there to allow my SNMP monitoring server</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:55:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then you need to configure the service to allow the Zenoss server to collect data from it, and to have it trap back to zenoss</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:55:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you need to configure snmp community strings to use</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:55:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; A number of packs have shown up, mostly zenoss-written, that implement some of the same stuff I did locally but with "real" datasources rather than just a Nagios plugin in .../libexec,</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:55:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; though in many cases it's just a wrapper around the same Nagios plugin</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:55:32] &lt;RoundQube&gt; ill go ahead and use your zenpack so i can at least learn how to instlal one of these packs</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:55:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; then set the public string in Zenoss under Devices -&gt; zProperties -&gt; zSnmpCommunity</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:55:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; I may move all my windows boxes to the WMI datasource/performance zenpacks</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:56:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: I'd STRONGLY advise against that right now</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:56:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; Sure, with the ZP broken in 2.5 :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:56:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: the WMI Data Sources pack breaks very badly in 2.5</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:56:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; Don't do WMI for monitoring</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:56:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; it basically trashes a 2.5 install</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:57:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; I went to Zenoss for training last month</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:57:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; what we were told was "WMI is OK for modeling, but it doesn't really work for performance monitoring"</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:57:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: once Egor releases a new version which Jives with 2.5, then I'd use it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:57:33] &lt;davetoo&gt; but ... this info about 2.5 is new</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:57:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm doing quite a bit of WMI already on 2.4.2</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:57:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; i get a ton of exchange/IIS info</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:57:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: WMI is hella unstable on the windows server's end</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:58:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; especially in server 2008</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:58:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah no joke, it can lock up from time to time.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:58:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2003 is relatively stable, 2008 is a nightmare</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:58:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; but the counters i need aren't available via SNMP</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:58:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; but SNMP works perfectly fine for both</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:58:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; what counters?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:59:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; exchange performance information, IIS performance information</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:59:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, yeh</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:59:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; for that I'd use WMI</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:59:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; but like I said, I'd wait until Egor fixes the packs to work with 2.5</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:59:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; otherwise you'll have a very very rough upgrade</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:59:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 15:59:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; well look at that, according to technet the counters are there... one sec</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:00:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could probably do some snmp-informant magic to expose those counters if they aren't there natively</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:00:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; maybe, but i didn't think informant could be modified</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:01:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think the commerical version can, it has quite a few more bells and whistles</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:01:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; that gets $$</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:01:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; s/commerical/commercial</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:01:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it does</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:01:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:01:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; but how many IIS and Exchange boxes are you running?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:01:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd only need it on those</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:01:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; all other boxes would be plain SNMP</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:02:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; either way, WMI really is the way to go for exchange and IIS costwise</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:02:21] &lt;RoundQube&gt; i followed howto's on getting snmp to work with my cisco 3550, i dont see any graphs and its been about 30 mins.</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:02:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: you just have to put it in the default Cisco device group</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:02:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk for a few</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:04:14] &lt;RoundQube&gt; not sure how to do that... ill googlez :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:06:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm looks like IIS would be easy via SNMP, but WMI works fine for me, no real issues</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:06:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; perhaps when the # of servers goes up the overhead gets to be a problem</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:08:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

I wish I had another of me</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:19:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; Yes, then there would be two of you for noobs like me to pester with simple questions :D</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:19:33] &lt;davetoo&gt; I need to learn how to write indexed modelers/collectors</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:19:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; eh, you ride track, you can bug me :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:19:55] &lt;davetoo&gt; which orgs do you race with?</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:19:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; Although I think I bother rmatte the most, he seems a glutton for punishment</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:20:11] &lt;twm1010&gt; I just do amateur trackdays right now, I do have my race license though</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:20:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; I was going to go for AFM but.. life got in the way</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:20:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; I used to do 20 trackdays a year or so... but not these days</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:20:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; Someday when I'm a zenoss expert getting paid lots of money I'll really jump into it</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:20:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; it's addictive</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:21:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; crashed hard yet? :)</span><br/><span> [15-Oct-2009 16:21:20] &lt;RoundQube&gt; i put my Cisco 3550 in /Network/Routers/Cisco group and still not getting any snmp data.

so I need to clean it up</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:32:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; aye</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:32:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, I think I just need the deleteAllEvents line</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:33:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; so, there's this frequent request for a dependency mechanism other than the layer-3 (ping) tree</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:33:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, layer 2 dependency has been a very frequent request</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:34:04] &lt;davetoo&gt; if you look at the code for Device, or the ZMI, you'll se two relations, named "dependencies" and "dependents"</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:34:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that probably won't even get looked at until after stone crab</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:34:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; I thought that might be the answer, until...</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:34:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; I discovered that those are only for ZenPack dependencies</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:34:43] &lt;davetoo&gt; bad name choice, then</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:35:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm sorely tempted to misuse them for Device dependencies,</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:36:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; and Device isn't even Packable,</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:36:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; but it's risky</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:37:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; its' so juicy, though, I may be tempted to go through the entire codebase and make a patch to change it to something like zenpackDependen*</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:38:14] &lt;davetoo&gt;

lol</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:47:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; hey, if you can basically get layer 3 dependencies working you shall be praised</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:50:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:50:41] &lt;davetoo&gt; I have ideas about that, too</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:50:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; it ought to be done as a directed graph, IMO</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 10:51:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; (and the layer 2, if that ever happens)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:03:44] &lt;davetoo&gt;

I think what that means is that the system couldn't find the device for an event</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:25:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; did you rename any of them?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:25:51] &lt;chemist&gt; no</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:25:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; Do you know which event generated that?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:26:26] &lt;chemist&gt; it happens with any event where a router goes down</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:26:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; I would try to find it in the database (by evid, maybe) and then verify that the devid is findable</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:27:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; well, getPingStatus() is defined in .../Products/ZenModel/Device.py</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:28:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; so it looks like the code is trying to call that on a nonexistent device object</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:28:53] &lt;chemist&gt; I feel out of my depth here</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:29:00] &lt;davetoo&gt;

well it's not handling the possibility that the find might fail</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:32:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; have you tride that find command in zendmd?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:32:35] &lt;chemist&gt; no, I just took it from one of the dev tips of the month</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:33:39] &lt;chemist&gt; sorry, no I havent tried it in zendmd</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:34:03] &lt;chemist&gt; and I took the transform from tip of the month article</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:34:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; you should; just fire up zendmd and execute "device = find('router1.bellevue.mydomain.co.uk')</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:34:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; (find is pre-defined in zendmd)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:35:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; or, just find('router1.bellevue.mydomain.co.uk')</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:35:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; if you do the latter, and you don't see something like &lt;Device at /zport/dmd/Devices/Network/router....&gt;, then it's not finding it by that ID</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:36:47] &lt;chemist&gt; it's finding it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:37:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; then I'm out of ideas, sorry</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:38:01] &lt;chemist&gt; thanks, this one has a few people puzzled</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:42:09] &lt;RoundQube&gt; hi all</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:42:31] &lt;RoundQube&gt; when classifying the PIX firewall, do i put it under /Network/Routers/Cisco or /Network/Router/Firewall?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:45:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; there doesn't appear to be anything special about 'Firewall'</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:45:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 'Cisco' contains collector plugins for CiscoMap and CiscoHSRP</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:45:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and a modified Device template</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:45:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I don't monitor that device, I can only report what I see</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:46:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the collector plugins are going to take advantage of the Cisco Enterprise MIB</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:46:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; err... OIDs</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:47:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; There is something special about /Network/Routers, though</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:47:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; or at least there used to be</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:48:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; I really quite liked "zendisc --routers",</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:48:37] &lt;davetoo&gt; I asked Erik about it last month while I was out there for training, and he said "people didn't like it"</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:48:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; so he didnt' bother keeping it maintained through the underlying architechture changes</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:49:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I just meant that Router and Firewall appear identical</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:49:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; but at the least, /Network/Routers sets the right icon for the flash network map :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:51:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, I kinda object to having device classes that don't do anything special shipped by Zenoss</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:51:12] &lt;chemist&gt; davetoo: I just noticed that error is not being generated by events, but seems happen once a minute</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:51:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; if Router and Firewall are in fact identical, but I got voted down</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:51:58] &lt;RoundQube&gt; mrayzenoss so you suggest i use /Network/Routers/Cisco?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:52:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I don't have Cisco expertise, but there is additional Cisco-specific monitoring available there</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:52:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; as compared to Router or Firewall</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 11:52:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; anyone using Cisco want to chime in?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:00:21] &lt;chemist&gt; looks like not many people can afford them :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:08:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh,</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:08:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; we have thousands of them</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:08:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; and some Big Ones</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:09:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; mrayzenoss: look at sugar case #5149</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:10:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; davetoo: cool</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:13:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'd love to see a graphviz-based static network-map generator</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:13:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; maybe in "reports"</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:13:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; tho these days I wouldn't be too surprised to see flash output for graphviz</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:29:30] &lt;exarkun&gt; What's the idea behind the /Devices organizer?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:29:53] &lt;exarkun&gt; It has things like "KVM" and "Printer" in it - okay, those sound like devices to me.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:30:11] &lt;exarkun&gt; But it also has "Ping" and "Discovered".&#160; What's the idea there?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:30:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's the root of the inheritance hierarchy</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:30:52] &lt;exarkun&gt; /Devices is the root of the inheritance hierarchy?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:30:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so /Ping is an empty device with only ping</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:31:01] * exarkun thinks about all the different ways in which he doesn't understand that.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:31:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and /Discovered is where new devices are placed</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:31:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so Device templates are inherited</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:31:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; err... hierarchal</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:31:31] * exarkun focuses on that</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:31:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so if you go to /Devices/Server</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:31:55] &lt;exarkun&gt; Okay, so when you say "inheritance hierarchy", are you specifically and only talking about templates?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:32:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:32:28] &lt;exarkun&gt; Alright, that sort of makes sense.&#160; I think I know what you're going to say about /Devices/Server now, but please say it anyway to make sure. :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:32:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; add a template at /Devices and it's available to everything else</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:32:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so 'Server' overrides the Device and FileSystem templates</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:33:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or actually, adds the FileSystem template</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:33:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so everything beneath /Devices/Server has the FileSystem template available</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:34:00] &lt;exarkun&gt; FileSystem is from an add-on, right?&#160; (Coz I don't see it beneath /Devices/Server with my fresh Zenoss install)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:34:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; no, FileSystem is default</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:34:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://yourserver:8080/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/perfConfig">http://yourserver:8080/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/perfConfig</a></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:34:47] &lt;exarkun&gt; Oh right, it's a template, not an organizer.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:34:53] &lt;exarkun&gt; Okay, I see it now.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:34:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, sorry</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:35:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so you can add, remove and modify templates within the hierarchy</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:36:37] &lt;exarkun&gt; And the way an organizer like "/Devices/Server" is used is that a... device... can have its "device class path" property set to it, and then all of the templates from /Devices/Server are available to be used with that device?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:36:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:37:28] &lt;exarkun&gt; But then there's also things like /Processes</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:37:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and you may customize the templates at the device class or the actual device</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:37:55] &lt;exarkun&gt; ... which I don't know anything about yet, but clearly is something entirely different from /Devices and everything beneath /Devices</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:38:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'd love to talk about how crappy /Processes is but I gotta go grab some lunch</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:38:17] &lt;exarkun&gt; But presumably some other part of zenoss uses the stuff in /Processes?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:38:21] &lt;exarkun&gt; okay</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:38:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:38:38] &lt;exarkun&gt; enjoy lunch</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:38:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; check Jane's paper on Process monitoring if you want to understand it really well: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/papers/jcurry.html">http://www.skills-1st.co.uk/papers/jcurry.html</a></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:39:07] * exarkun probably isn't interested in monitoring processes at all</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:39:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; sorry, haven't eaten in 6 hours</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:39:15] &lt;exarkun&gt; no worries :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:55:15] &lt;exarkun&gt; Hm, strange.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:55:24] &lt;exarkun&gt; So now I know about /manage and the "Properties" tab</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:55:40] &lt;exarkun&gt; And I wonder why all the ZenPacks that I've looked at go so far out of their way to provide /another/ redundant configuration ui.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:56:13] &lt;exarkun&gt; Maybe something to do with access control?&#160; If I weren't the root user, would I still have access to this?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 12:59:11] &lt;exarkun&gt; Hm no, actually I'm already not logged in as the root user.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:00:29] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; ty for link to jcurry's papers mrayze</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:06:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so... for each device there's a command menu with stuff like ping and snmpwalk listed... and it appears that javascript is used to call on the commands, is there any way to call on a direct URL to do particular commands?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:06:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I basically want to create a links in our ticketing system for ping and snmpwalk which opens a new browser window and performs either of the commands automatically for a device</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:07:27] &lt;exarkun&gt; rmatte: Maybe with the rest API</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:08:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; exarkun: don't know if REST would really cover this</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:09:52] &lt;exarkun&gt; I have a device with id "boson", and this url runs ping on it: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://electron:8080/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/devices/boson/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping">http://electron:8080/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/devices/boson/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping</a></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:10:26] &lt;exarkun&gt; not really rest, I guess.&#160; just an url. :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:10:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh right, yeh, I was thinking something like that...</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:11:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; the javascript is: javascript:submitCommandForm('ping')</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:12:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I basically need to do something like: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/deviceManagement?commandId=ping">http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/deviceManagement?commandId=ping</a></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:12:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; but with the correct call</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:12:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually...</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:13:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping">http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping</a></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:13:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; that might work</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:13:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll try it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:13:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; aha, it does</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:13:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:18:35] &lt;dollarbang&gt; I've installed the "fping" zenpack, I thought it would be useful, couldn't find anything on how to use it.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:19:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it adds a template you can bind</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:19:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and the template uses /usr/sbin/fping</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:23:34] &lt;exarkun&gt; What's the likelihood that I'll be able to add a new "Class"?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:23:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Device class?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:24:06] &lt;exarkun&gt; Mmm, no</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:24:20] &lt;exarkun&gt; I should ask this question in a better way</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:24:52] &lt;exarkun&gt; I'm working on a data source that gets its data by running a user-supplied script on whatever nodes it is applied to</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:25:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can do that with a command data source</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:25:28] &lt;exarkun&gt; I'm to the point where I'm thinking about how the scripts will be managed (created, modified, deleted, mainly) in the ui</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:26:02] &lt;exarkun&gt; I have to use a funny transport to communicate with the nodes, which I think prevents any of the existing similar data sources from working</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:26:25] &lt;exarkun&gt; (an ssl connection established from the node to the zenoss server)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:27:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah crap</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:27:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I need it to do it regardless of device classification</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:27:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; this could be more difficult than I though</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:27:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; thought*</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:29:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; anyone have any ideas?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:31:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; do what regardless of classification?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:31:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok...</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:31:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm trying to have add a link to our ticketing system to ping or snmpwalk a device</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:31:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; something like </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping">http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping</a></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:31:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I'm filling in the hostname and the device name based on ticket system variables</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:32:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; the problem is that it'll only work for Linux devices in that case</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:32:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I need to somehow make a link that does the same thing for devices regardless of what group they are in</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:32:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure if it's possible</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:32:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can use commands against groups</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:33:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and devices can belong to multiple groups</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:33:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; like, is there a way to just do: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping">http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping</a></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:33:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; or something</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:34:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; and eliminate the whole /Server/Linux portion</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:34:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I dunno, that's why I was suggesting you user /Groups/blah instead of /Devices/Server/Linux</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:34:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and put every device in the group</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:35:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:35:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; not ideal, but works around the issue</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:35:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:36:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Groups/Server/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping">http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Groups/Server/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping</a><span> doesn't work</span></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:36:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; nor does removing /devices</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:37:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; It'd be nice if there was just a general way to call on a command for a device lol</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:41:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; If I could do something like: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/deviceSearchResults?query=gen01.novanoc.com">http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/deviceSearchResults?query=gen01.novanoc.com</a><span> then put something after it to carry out the ping based on the URL that comes up, that would work...</span></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:41:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; it would just be a huge pain</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:57:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I just went through ZMI and the devices don't actually show up as items under Groups</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:57:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; so that's not going to work</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:59:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; relations</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:59:47] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; how would one view a /16 network in "view network map"?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 13:59:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; hm?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:00:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:00:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, they are relations</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:00:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is useless in this case</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:00:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:00:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; eughhh, there has to be a way to do this...</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:00:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; I tuned in late :) what are you trying to do?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:00:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: the network map just views from whatever IP that you specify downward</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:00:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: but it's limited to a certain amount of hops, so you can't view the entire map in one shot</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:01:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: ok, here's the just of it...</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:01:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I want to add links in to our ticketing system which our NOC staff can click which will execute commands in Zenoss (such as snmpwalk and ping)</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:01:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; the URL to do something like that is: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping">http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/gen01.novanoc.com/manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping</a></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:02:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only problem is that obviously not all device are categorized under /Server/Linux</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:02:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it only works for a handful of devices</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:02:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I need to find a way to make it work for all devices</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:02:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you do something like: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/deviceSearchResults?query=gen01.novanoc.com">http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/deviceSearchResults?query=gen01.novanoc.com</a></span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:02:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; it brings you to the device's page, which in this case would be: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/gen01.novanoc.com">http://lab01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/Linux/devices/gen01.novanoc.com</a></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:03:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just need to find a way of pulling that URL dynamically for each device and then appending /manage_doUserCommand?commandId=ping to the end of it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:04:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; It would be nice if I could just do it all in a URL address but I highly doubt that will be the case</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:04:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; Oh...</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:04:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; almost certainly not; I'm not even sure how to do it in TALES, which is still black magic to me</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:05:05] &lt;RoundQube&gt; is there a page for Zenoss that we can have on a big monitor that shows current system status (whats down/up)? Kinda like the whatsup html pages that show current system status</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:05:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I might have to have some sort of php script that I send the info to which does it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:05:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; just kind of a pain in the ass</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:05:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; but zendmd</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:05:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; (especially since I'm not that great at php lol)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:05:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; python query</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:05:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: you'd have to script something like that</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:06:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: wouldn't be overly difficult to do though</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:06:21] &lt;RoundQube&gt;

my my-Fu is very weak</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:11:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: you really just need to tell myadmin to hit the zenoss mysql database with the correct credentials</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:11:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's about all there is to it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:11:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; from when I did it anyways</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:12:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; have to add user perms to mysql too, though,</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:12:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; for %</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:12:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that was like 8 months ago or something lol</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:12:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; I just need to flush the events and history table on this server I just re-installed upon</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:12:52] &lt;rmatte&gt;

that's not going to work,</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:15:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; because those devices don't *exist* anymore :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:15:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh right</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:15:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; It was an eval install of Enterprise 2.3.3,</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:15:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm hold on, I'll find another way of doing it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:15:58] &lt;davetoo&gt;

no idea why it does that then</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:32:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; why don't you do it by hostname instead?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:37:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; gotta go to a meeting....</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:41:32] &lt;eidolon&gt; hi folks, can someone help me out with setting up a basic URL monitor?&#160; I want to a) make sure it answers with a 200, and 2) collect ping times.&#160; what i did was added a device , set discovery to 'none', put it in the /Device class.&#160; Went into that, went to templates, made a local copy for 'Device', and added a data source.&#160; Set the class for the datasource to HTTPMonitor</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:41:38] &lt;eidolon&gt; but it doesn't appear to be collecting graphable data.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:42:30] &lt;eidolon&gt; am i doing this right?&#160; :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:42:58] &lt;eidolon&gt; under Data Sources, I see 'Source (ip address)' 'Source type: httpmonitor'</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:47:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; eidolon: I don't even populate IP address</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:47:54] &lt;rmatte&gt;

when did you create the datapoint?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:48:24] &lt;eidolon&gt; 10 minutes ago?&#160; but the datasource doens't let me create graphs from it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:48:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're aware that it takes 15 minutes (3 polling cycles) for a graph to generate in Zenoss?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:48:47] &lt;eidolon&gt; right</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:48:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; do you at least see a graph with 'nan' as the values?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:48:52] &lt;eidolon&gt; but even if there's no chart data</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:48:53] &lt;eidolon&gt; right</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:48:56] &lt;eidolon&gt; you'd see an rrd output</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:48:57] &lt;eidolon&gt; i don't :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 14:49:01] &lt;eidolon&gt;

rmatte: i'm worried now.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:02:35] &lt;eidolon&gt; did we just lose a huge zenpack?&#160; *fiddles*</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:02:58] &lt;majikman&gt; rmatte, i didn't try reading every page in the admin guide, but i did a search for the words and it came up blank</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:03:17] &lt;eidolon&gt; add data source -&gt; httpmonitor is still there.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:03:29] &lt;eidolon&gt; so where is the /Application/HTTP class?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:04:04] * eidolon adds under /Web</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:05:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm checking to make sure that that's actually where it puts the template</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:05:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; and yeh, apparently it does create /Devices/Application/HTTPD</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:05:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; from what I can see in the ZenPack properties</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:05:33] &lt;markeriv&gt; well i just made a booboo</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:05:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; s/HTTPD/HTTP</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:05:55] &lt;markeriv&gt;

and now my server is practically locked up</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:06:08] &lt;markeriv&gt; sigh</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:06:18] &lt;markeriv&gt; and the alerts keep coming even after I believe I removed the threshold</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:06:30] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; I'm working on a ZenPack to use with the Vyatta router - when I'm done, where should I send it?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:06:37] * eidolon nods</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:06:41] &lt;eidolon&gt;

kk</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:11:38] &lt;markeriv&gt; joy</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:11:48] &lt;markeriv&gt; so is there any way to delete all events from the console?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:14:40] &lt;markeriv&gt; yes? no? maybe? tough crap sherlock you gotta do it manually?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:14:52] &lt;eidolon&gt; click 'all'</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:14:56] &lt;eidolon&gt; then click 'move to history'?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:14:59] &lt;markeriv&gt; that freezes</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:15:48] &lt;markeriv&gt; and when it unfreezes they are still there :(</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:15:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; markeriv: yeh, by delete I assume you mean move to history?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:16:04] &lt;majikman&gt; is there an easy way to access all the templates in the system? its kind of a drag right now having to click Devices-&gt;sub device-&gt;sub device-&gt;etc then templates</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:17:45] &lt;rmatte&gt;

how do i get in zendmd</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:18:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; markeriv: become the zenoss user (su - zenoss)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:18:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; then type zendmd</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:18:38] &lt;rmatte&gt;

is anyone here good with php?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:20:10] &lt;markeriv&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:20:18] &lt;markeriv&gt; that command line is spitting out some errors</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:20:25] &lt;markeriv&gt; was that supposed to be all on one line?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:21:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; no</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:21:39] &lt;markeriv&gt; hmm alright</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:21:41] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you'd only need a space if you had it formatted the way I actually pasted it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:23:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; the second line would have needed to be indented since it'd within a for loop</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:23:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'd = it'd be</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:25:54] &lt;markeriv&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:25:59] &lt;markeriv&gt; so its running and showing me the ...</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:26:14] &lt;markeriv&gt;

but yeh, it's worth a shot</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:28:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; run that command then do commit()</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:28:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I always follow my zendmd's with commit()'s out of habit, since I've been burned before</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:28:59] &lt;rmatte&gt;

(could take QUITE a while)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:50:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; then when you see &gt;&gt;&gt; type commit() and hit enter</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:50:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; and hopefully that'll solve your problem</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:51:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never tried to delete that many events from zendmd but hopefully it'll work</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:52:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; this way is a bit better than the last way since it's using only 1 function per device instead of 1 function per event</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:53:15] &lt;markeriv&gt; sweet</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:53:18] &lt;markeriv&gt; think thats working</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:53:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; good, give it some time</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:54:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; that'll only delete events that show up in the console, not historical events (I figured that would be more desirable than trashing your whole events database)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:54:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you need to do it for historical events too you can do the exact same thing but do dmd.ZenEventManager.manage_deleteHistoricalEvents(d.id)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:55:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; or deleteAllEvents for both event console and historical</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:56:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; depends on what you want to do</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:56:15] &lt;majikman&gt; so i'm trying to modify my graphing intervals to change all my graphs to poll data once every minute. i see that i have to set a custom definition for the graphs. do i have to do it for every graph or is there some way to do it globally?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:57:09] * davetoo is downloading rmatte's cisco mib zenpack just now :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:57:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; which is double-zipped :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:57:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; being a zipped egg in the first place</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:57:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: I think you need to go to Collectors -&gt; Edit and then there's Default RRD Create Command at the bottom, you need to edit those values</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:58:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: then you most likely need to use RRDtool to convert existing RRDs</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:58:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh, but where are the actual mibs?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:59:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: there aren't any, they are already compiled in to the objects.xml file</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:59:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh!</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:59:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; just install the pack and it'll inject the mib data in to Zenoss directly</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:59:31] &lt;kobalt&gt; anyone got a moment to look at an error Im getting with when running some code from the playing with interfaces wiki example&gt;</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:59:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; no screwing around with Mibs necessary</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:59:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it slaps them in a Cisco Mibs organizer</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:59:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; well screwing with MIBS is what I need, because I was just trying to snarf your fixes :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:59:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure you run the zendmd command listed on the ZenPack page after you're done installing the pack</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 15:59:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; for use with net-snmp</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:00:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; and tkined</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:00:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh...</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:00:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://demonic.cc/?p=20">http://demonic.cc/?p=20</a></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:00:16] &lt;majikman&gt; rmatte, thanks... thats what i was thinking. but according to the faq, there seems to be something else</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:00:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; my fixes are detailed there</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:00:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:00:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you can download my modified mibs from there</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:00:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:00:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: I've never personally done it, just working off what I've heard</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:01:34] &lt;majikman&gt; ok, thanks</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:01:50] &lt;kobalt&gt;

davetoo: yeh, all of the zenpacks are double zipped, it's a quirk of Jive</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:06:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; hopefully that's getting fixed at some point (I know they have a ticket open with Jive for it)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:12:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; how, what sequence do I need to load these in :)&#160;&#160; I wonder if tkined is still under development</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:13:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; wow, some chinese squatter has grabbed utwente.nl</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:13:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; what sequence do you need to load the cisco Mibs in you mean?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:13:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; that link I pasted has a step by step guide on loading them</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:14:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's so many so you really need to run it through once and let a bunch fail, then run the command that I specified for loading like 6 of the core mibs in order</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:14:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; then run through it all again to load the rest</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:14:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a pain in the arse, hence why I made a zenpack out of them</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:14:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:14:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; rmatte: what i'm doing is trying to load your patched mibs into an old tcl/tk monitoring/browser package called tkIned</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:14:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:14:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; I thought it had died on the vine</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:15:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; actually I htink it has.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:18:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; Loading the Mibs in to Zenoss is most likely a little different than loading them in to anything else lol</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:18:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes; I find tkIned indespensible</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:18:43] &lt;davetoo&gt; as a mib browser and for small network maps</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:19:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; but it's orphaned</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:24:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, it's written in tcl/tk</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:24:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's oldschool</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:24:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:26:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; is anyone using this OpenLayers ZenPack?&#160; I'm trying to fix it based on a patch and I can't get it to work at all</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:27:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; I should, since I contribute to OpenStreetMap, but I don't use any geo mapping yet</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:28:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ahhh... build error</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:28:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; see, I can't leave well enough alone, I want the ZenPack to build from source</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:29:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it left out the skins directory</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:29:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; wait... it added it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:36:26] &lt;markeriv&gt; btw</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:36:28] &lt;markeriv&gt; thanks guys</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:36:29] &lt;markeriv&gt; that worked :D</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:39:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; speaking of old tk apps... I love dirdiff</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:39:48] &lt;majikman&gt; mrayzenoss, is there a known bug with zenprocess incorrectly reporting processes running/not running?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:40:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte could probably tell you better</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:40:28] &lt;majikman&gt; oh... sorry. i thought you were a zenoss developer</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:40:30] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I know it's finicky, I just don't know if there are any big issues</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:40:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm the Community Manager</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:40:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so I'm 1/3 developer</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:40:45] &lt;majikman&gt; oh ok</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:40:45] &lt;majikman&gt; haha</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:41:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 1/3 support and 1/3 marketing</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:43:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; or jane</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:44:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; Who I keep wanting to call Jane Curtin</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:52:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:52:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; Curry, like the dish</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:52:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:53:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; markeriv: glad to hear it worked</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:53:49] &lt;davetoo&gt; I just stopped zenoss and truncated my event tables :0</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:54:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: zenprocess is quirky, but I don't believe there are actually any open bug tickets for it since it's hard to reproduce but it does happen from time to time</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:54:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; But I didn't have to keep any production data</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:54:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: yeh, I wanted to avoid blowing away his historical events</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:55:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; rmatte: majikman: on a heavily loaded system (monitored target), I used to see zenprocess time out before the target agent got around to sending part or all of the process table</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:55:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; speaking of heavily-loaded... this snmp walk on my Nexus 7010 from ciscoMgmt is taking a *long* time;</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:56:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; I hope it doesn't make the box fall over</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:56:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; I hope NX-OS is smarter about not letting the snmp agent bog the box, than earlier IOS versions</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:57:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenoss might timeout before it's done modelling the device :P</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:57:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; not zenoss</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:57:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless you increase the collector cycle time to like 5000</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:57:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh, zenprocess, yeah</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:57:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, just a old fashioned snmpwalk</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:57:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:57:35] &lt;majikman&gt; i don't htink thats the issue i'm having. the boxes i'm monitoring are loaded... but i wouldn't say "heavily-loaded". when running form the command line, the debug output from zenprocess on one line says WARNING:zen.zenprocess:Process not running: httpd and 3 lines below that, it says: INFO:zen.zenprocess:There are 98 pids by the name usr_local_apache2_bin_httpd</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:57:41] &lt;majikman&gt; so... i don't get whats going on with it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:57:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; majikman: neither do I.</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:58:01] &lt;majikman&gt; haha, ok</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:58:14] &lt;majikman&gt; i'm going to try to do some debugging in the python and hoepfully, i can put together a ticket</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:58:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; I haven't done any detailed debugging but I certainly can't predict it's behavior when I have to match against params</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:58:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; Since we have NIS everywhere and I have a special user for ssh monitoring, I may resort to that</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:58:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's pretty quirky, I just haven't had any time to do testing to try to isolate bugs with it</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 16:59:18] &lt;majikman&gt; i suck at python but hopefully i get seomthing for you rmatte</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:02:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; sometimes I think about installing Linux on this laptop</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:05:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:06:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; How large is the disk/how much free space?&#160; might try dual-boot for a while</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:14:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I do have the space for it and I've run linux for 10+ years</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:14:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm just comfortable with OSX, it makes things too easy</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:25:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; anyone using Eclipse might enjoy this: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3751.html">docs/DOC-3751</a></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:32:55] &lt;majikman&gt; does zenoss have any plans to work with latest stable of python 2.x? or maybe even 3.x?</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:33:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:33:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Ian is working on Python 2.6 and Zope 2.12 right now</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:34:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; he's got an SVN branch for it, he'll merge it into trunk when it's ready</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:34:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hopefully in the next month</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:34:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it'll be the post-2.5 release, currently code-named Stone Crab</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:42:34] &lt;majikman&gt; sweet, thanks for the update</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:50:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:50:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; so, now I have to figure out how the heck to tie together snmp oids from several different mibs,</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:51:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; i.e. while reading values from one mib I have to get the display values from another</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:51:41] &lt;davetoo&gt; (new-style cisco sensor values)</span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 17:51:52] &lt;majikman&gt;

I gotta run, but you can open tickets on dev.zenoss.org with patches</span><br/><span><span> [16-Oct-2009 18:05:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; email </span><a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:mray@zenoss.com">mray@zenoss.com</a><span> and I can get you your own account, or use zenoss/zenoss</span></span><br/><span> [16-Oct-2009 18:19:02] &lt;majikman&gt;

It isn't network wide, but maybe a quarter of the servers. This is the 3rd time we've gotten it in the past 2 weeks and the servers reported are always different. Do you guys have any ideas?</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 10:36:34] &lt;zmoazeni&gt; Oh I should say, Nagios reports no errors. Both are using SNMP to connect to the devices</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 11:44:59] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; is there a way to monitor a website without tying the monitor to any single device?</span><br/><span><span> [18-Oct-2009 11:48:15] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; (i.e. - check_http -H </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://website">http://website</a><span> -r textstring1 where website is load balanced between multiple devices, and as such it doesn't make sense to put the monitor on a single device)</span></span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 11:58:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm pretty sure that's a FAQ that you'll find the answer to if you search the forum archives</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 13:04:29] &lt;davetoo&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 13:11:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; cgibbons: did you see the ticket that got auto-assigned to you about the physicalEntity modeler that Nathan is proposing?</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 13:11:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; It is Sunday, so feel free to tell me to pound sand until tomorrow :)</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 13:19:37] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i saw it, i'm sure i won't look at it :)</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 13:20:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; ah, well then you won't see my rebuttal :)</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 13:25:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; On a slightly different topic: I'm looking at all the different kinds of sensors that Cisco provides, and&#160; wondering whether it makes sense to refactor the hardware sensor model to have an abstract Sensor class, and subclass into boolean and continuous, and then temperature, voltage, current, power (dbM)</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 13:25:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; fan speed</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 13:25:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; there's a whole lot of stuff available</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 13:26:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; I don't want to create new sensor models for those (Cisco) sensor without a parent class, really; feels hackish not to.</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 14:04:42] &lt;skipzoid&gt; evening all</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 14:05:02] &lt;skipzoid&gt; anyone else here ?</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 14:09:01] &lt;skipzoid&gt; i'm having problems getting a command to run upon an event - its just started to happen - this is the output of the zenactions log -</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 17:44:25] RoninX341 is now known as etank</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 22:57:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; I don't know why I'm at such a loss to figure out how to start this snmp data collector :)</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:26:40] &lt;salax&gt; davetoo, what's the problem?</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:27:43] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm jumping into the deep end :)</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:28:07] &lt;salax&gt; on what box specifically</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:28:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; Modern Ciscos use ENTITY-MIB to enumerate CPUs and Sensors,</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:28:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; what I need to do is start by pulling the entire entPhysicalTable,</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:28:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; keep only the cpu and sensor objects</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:29:07] &lt;salax&gt; davetoo, havent try on top of any ciscos yet :p</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:29:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; and on a second pass get the cisco-specific sensor info to classify each sensor</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:29:54] &lt;salax&gt; i have problem in getting hrSWInstalled on top of openbsd box.. anyone have any solution(s)?</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:29:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm just now working up my first GetTableMap invocation</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:30:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [18-Oct-2009 23:30:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; Theo won't let you :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 00:00:46] [disconnected at Mon Oct 19 00:00:46 2009]</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 00:00:46] [connected at Mon Oct 19 00:00:46 2009]</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 00:00:56] [zenoss-logger (logger bot) has joined #zenoss]</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 00:19:39] cgibbons_ is now known as cgibbons</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 00:30:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; cgibbons: is there an "easy" way to test datacollector plugins under development, with live snmp polling, but that doesn't require a live device database?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 00:31:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; i.e. I want to be able to test against arbitrary devices that are not in the zenoss instance</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 05:02:38] &lt;quadro_&gt; hello there</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 05:02:46] &lt;quadro_&gt; anyone running betas?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 05:51:03] quadro_ is now known as Quadro</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 08:29:40] &lt;cgibbons&gt; davetoo: yeah there are snmp simulators out there that will playback any data previously captured.</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 08:34:43] &lt;ckrough&gt;

that seems to go for Zenoss too, IMHO.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:14:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I need to get raddle setup on a lab box at some point</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:14:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; would be uber useful for development purposes</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:14:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; What is it?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:14:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; snmp simulator</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:14:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; replays previously captured snmp data when snmpwalked</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:15:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you could use it for testing modelling specific types of devices</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:15:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; or for testing the gathering of data (though it would be static data, but at least if you saw no breaks in the graphs you'd know it's working)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:36:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; mhmmmm, a device which Zenoss previously modeled the interfaces on perfectly fine, back in Zenoss 2.3.3... and now Zenoss is suddenly incapable of modelling them</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:36:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm getting the lovely "2009-10-19 10:34:16ERROR&#160; zen.ZenModelerUnable to get data for ips01asha from either ipAddrTable or ipNetToMediaTable -- skipping model" message</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:38:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; pretty frigging anoying</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:39:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; something needs to be done about that, because in this case all other relevant interface info is available via SNMP and the ipAddrTable and ipNetToMediaTable data is completely unnecessary and irrelevant</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:40:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I don't know why Zenoss is suddenly hell-bent on getting that info</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:41:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; the device that I'm experiencing the issue on is a Cisco TippingPoint IPS</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:42:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../message/12705.html#12705">message/12705</a><span> &lt;--- Why are people having to edit source code to get this type of modelling functionality?&#160;

that seems similar to the issues I'm seeing</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:49:03] &lt;cgibbons&gt; doesn't that thread say it didn't make the cut for the release but will be going into the maintenance release, rmatte?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:49:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: according to Trac the milestone is now Stone Crab</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:49:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: also, I find it odd that it worked fine for me back in 2.3.3 when I originally modeled these devices</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:50:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it doesn't work now</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:50:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; Now I have no interface monitoring on one of our devices because I removed the interfaces then tried to remodel them and it didn't work</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:52:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; To quote one of our network engineers: "I did an snmpwalk on several TippingPoint IPSes and neither of them have ipAddrTable and ipNetToMediaTable defined, yet they were all modeled successfully in the past"</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:53:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; So something obviously changed between 2.3.3 and now</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:53:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; but snmpwalk isn't a zenoss application, so why wouldn't snmpwalk show the same as it did before?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:56:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: you're missing the point...</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:57:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: the point is that the 2 values which Zenoss is complaining that it can't find (ipAddrTable or</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:57:03] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ipNetToMediaTable</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:57:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; were never there on any of these devices</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:57:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; yet Zenoss modeled the interfaces perfectly fine in the past</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:57:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; well, then it wasn't using that table to get it.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:57:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; so something has obviously changed in the InterfaceMap.py code to change that</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:58:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: All I'd have to do is modify the InterfaceMap.py code to ignore those values and proceed anyways and it would model the interfaces fine, but I absolutely hate having to modify actual core code to do stuff like this</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 09:58:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; I see.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:00:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I guess I'll have to do it temporarily just to get these interfaces modeled again</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:01:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; sounds like a pretty major bug, its probably causing a lot of people headaches</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:02:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; most likely, check out the comments for the different sections in the code...</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:02:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; # Interface related tables likely to be used in all subclasses.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:02:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the comment above the section which is sufficient to model any type of interface</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:02:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; # ipAddrTable is the better way to get IP addresses</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:02:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; # Use the ipNetToMediaTable as a backup to the ipAddrTable</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:02:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; so ipAddrTable is a better way, but not absolutely necessary</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:03:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; and ipNetToMediaTable is just a backup to ipAddrTable</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:03:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; meaning that neither of them are absolutely necessary</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:03:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; yet Zenoss totally halts the modelling process if it doesn't find either value</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:03:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; that seems like quite a bit of an oversight to me</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:05:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m77a319bd">http://pastebin.com/m77a319bd</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:05:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's the problem code</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:05:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll modify it slightly and the interfaces should model perfectly fine...</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:06:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; hopefully anyways...</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:07:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; bingo</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:07:32] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yay!</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:07:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; all I did was comment out the "return none" line and the interfaces modeled</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:08:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; obviously not the most elegant solution</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:08:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; but whatever works</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:10:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; The interfaces show up with names like "Index_3" "Index_4" and so on, but at least I can actually monitor them</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:10:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm opening a Trac for this</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:12:02] &lt;cgibbons&gt; a trac for what, the index names being wrong after you've modified it?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:12:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: no, the fact that I had to modify it to get the interfaces to model at all</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:12:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: it's stupid that it assumes that ipAddrTable and ipNetToMediaTable are always going to be there</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:12:46] &lt;cgibbons&gt; how would it be different than 3583?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:12:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; because they aren't</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:13:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; "Several Cisco users report that the port names and descriptions are not correctly identified."</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:13:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; That's the description of 3583</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:13:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; totally different</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:13:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; similar issues, but not the same</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:14:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; In this case there aren't any port names available via SNMP, so the fact that Zenoss labels them "Index_3" and so on automatically is actually quite nice</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:14:30] &lt;cgibbons&gt; okay - could you include an snmp walk for the device with the ticket? that'll help make sure we grok it.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:14:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; Absolutely</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:14:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; You want a full snmpwalk or just the relevant values?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:14:59] &lt;cgibbons&gt; someone very deliberately coded it that way so we'll have to make sure we're not just fixing a symptom, yadda yadda</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:15:09] &lt;cgibbons&gt; full is always better but whatever you'd like if there's private data in there you don't want</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:15:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll include a full one, not a problem</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:15:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll have to go through and modify some of the stuff to censor it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:16:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, do you want just a standard snmpwalk or one with the -0n flag?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:16:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; (Not sure which is more useful to you)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:17:47] &lt;cgibbons&gt; standard would be fine i think</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:17:54] &lt;cgibbons&gt; we can always find you if we need more :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:18:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; true enough, I am definitely around</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:18:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; alright, I'll grab the info and log the ticket...</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:18:27] &lt;cgibbons&gt; that'll see that tomorrow during the defect review (if not before) and the CS guys will likely be able to prioritize it better than i could</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:19:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; tag it for King Crab and maybe it will make 2.5.1</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:19:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; This should literally be like 10 or 20 lines of code to fix, so I hope it does</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:22:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; Basically all that needs to be done is to not have it return none when those 2 values aren't found, change the log message so that it doesn't say "skipping model", and one thing which would be more of a nice to have would be for it to just number the interfaces instead of putting Index_1 and so on.&#160; Or maybe have it put something like "Interface_1" instead, it would just make it look cleaner.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:41:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, it doesn't correspond to an actual port number, only the index number, so leaving it as Index_# is fine</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 10:41:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; so really it's literally a 2 second job to fix this</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:08:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; voila: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5691">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5691</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:09:03] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Do I install this pac on the computer that needs to be monitored or the one that zenoss is running on</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:32:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: the packs need to be installed in Zenoss itself</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:32:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are ZenPacks</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:33:02] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok cool</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:33:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, nothing to install on the machine being monitored (other than allowing SSH access)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:33:21] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; thanks I am new to this application. I come from a nagios setup and looking to use zenoss</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:33:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, Zenoss is definitely a lot easier to setup than Nagios</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:33:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; It does have it's little quirks though :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:34:15] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; all apps do. Interface is a lot better that nagios</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:34:25] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; have to get use to how things work around here though</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:35:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; The interface is going to be completely revamped to look even better in about 7 months from now</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:35:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; JROCK2004: make sure you read the Getting Started Guide </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zenoss/files/Documentation/Getting%20Started/Getting_Started_with_Zenoss.pdf/download">http://sourceforge.net/projects/zenoss/files/Documentation/Getting%20Started/Getting_Started_with_Zenoss.pdf/download</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:36:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: yeh, and read the Zenoss Admin Guide from top to bottom when you get a chance (I recommend the PDF version, makes for easier reading)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:36:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; the bookmarks even work :)</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:36:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: If you want a preview of sort of what Zenoss will look like in about 7 or 8 months, check out: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://public-demo.zenoss.com/evconsole">http://public-demo.zenoss.com/evconsole</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:37:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; (although that new event console will be available in the next release due out in a few weeks)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:37:32] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok so the link for the zenpack has a .egg file. IS that what I want to install?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:37:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; Oh, yeh, it'll be zipped (it shouldn't be so unzip it)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:37:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; then when you just have the regular .egg, install that</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:38:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to become the zenoss user</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:38:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then do: zenpack --install &lt;filename&gt;</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:38:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; or you can install it from the GUI as well</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:38:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; up to you</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:38:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do it from the commandline since it doesn't time out</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:38:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; (on bigger packs)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:39:20] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; well I like that tool it tells me I am missing ZenPacks.community.LinuxMonitorAddOn</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:39:24] &lt;davetoo&gt; the cli is your friend</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:39:24] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; so I will google that app</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:39:35] &lt;davetoo&gt; is my friend, anyway</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:40:02] &lt;cgibbons&gt; so those changes our QA lead just made to your ticket means it'll get reviewed as a proposed 2.5.1 patch, rmatte</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:40:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: that's just another ZenPack</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:40:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3435.html">docs/DOC-3435</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:41:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: thanks</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:43:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; cgibbons: that snmp simulator is interesting; how do *you guys* develop a new snmp plugin?&#160; How independently from a running zenoss instance?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:44:53] &lt;cgibbons&gt; well, honestly there havent been too many new SNMP plugins developed in a long time, it's mostly been other kinds of stuff. Chet has a nice tool that does a simulator from an snmpwalk output (it's in the source tree somewhere), and then we used a commerical tool called.. um SNMPPro or something like that (I can find out) that's like this open-source one, but bigger.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:44:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; I don't yet understand the python snmp stuff;&#160; does zope need to be running for the snmp plugin/client stuff (GetTableMap) to work?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:45:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; 'k</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:46:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; I have live systems to query,</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:46:20] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok I got a bunch of output from install the linuxmonitor one</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:46:39] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; so I am assuming I can just try the first one now and see if that installs</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:46:55] &lt;davetoo&gt; What I'm trying to do is a rush job to get some Cisco temperature sensor data</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:47:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; from modern modular cisco boxes like 7600s and such;</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:48:23] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok installing the community ubuntu getting errors about blocked by allowed hosts and the could not find index page for the linuxmonitor addon</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:48:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; we've got some systems crashing from what I think are false positive sensor values and I thought this might be good motivation for me to figure this out</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:48:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: yes</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:48:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: if it says it's finished installing the first one</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:48:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; oops</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:48:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; that was meant for JROCK</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:48:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:49:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: also, you may need to restart Zenoss after installing that first pack</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:49:49] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; rmatte: ok restarting now</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:53:10] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; rmatte: figured it out that it wanted LinuxMonitorAddon instead of LinuxMonitor</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:54:51] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; is there a way to manually add a device class</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:55:11] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; is that in the pdf file</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:55:16] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; admin pdf</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:56:15] &lt;twm1010&gt; any apache monitoring gurus around?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 11:59:23] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; rmatte: well it looks via the gui the zenpack for LinuxMonitor is working. I cannot install the ununtu package cause it cannot find the device class</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:01:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; davetoo: i think for testing modeling plugins you really only need zenhub and zeo running. the modeler daemon that you run collects the data and parses it, and then sends it off to zenhub for it to put in the database.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:02:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:03:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: you may need to create the class by hand</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:03:57] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; rmatte: ok where would I do that</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:04:08] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; if there is a doc you can point me there</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:05:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; you really just need to figure out what class it's complaining about and create it from the gui</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:05:16] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; I know the class</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:05:26] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; Server/SSH/Linux/Ubuntu</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:05:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; then click on "Devices" on the left</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:05:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; navigate to where the class should be</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:05:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; then go to the dropdown and select Add Class or whatever</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:05:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm eating right now so can't check, just doing it off the top of my head</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:07:25] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; Got it. Add organization</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:07:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:12:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; So... my question is... are totalAccesses from Apache and Connections from IIS equivalent counters</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:12:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm thinking no.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:13:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; the way I'd interpret total accesses is as a value of the total amount of times it has been accessed versus the total amount of current active connections</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:13:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah, i'm trying to correlate current bandwidth against # of connections to the webserver</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:14:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; so perhaps for apache, i should use slotKeepAlive</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:14:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, technically there are no steady connection to a web server though</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:14:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not like a vpn server or something where you can track current connections</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:14:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; it dishes out a page then it's done</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:15:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; (unless it's running something specifically coded to require steady connections)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:15:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; well, i need an equivalent value from IIS and apache to graph together</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:15:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; to show # of visitors</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:16:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:16:30] &lt;twm1010&gt; they can be a little off i suppose, but not too far</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:17:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure, never setup IIS monitoring to that degree as of yet</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:26:00] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; rmatte: ok so I added the</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:26:43] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok so I added the the cmd.linux.Ubuntu_aptiitude. then I clicked on model device</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:26:57] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; I have waited about 10 minutes and still nothing</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:27:24] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; looking at the events it talks about the zCommandUsername is not set but when I look it is</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:31:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; where are you looking to see zCommandUsername?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:31:53] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; inside the server I hit the dropdwn and go to zproperties</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:32:07] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; so I click on device list then intranet</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:32:21] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; then I hit the drop arrow and navigate to zProperties</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:32:53] &lt;Mousey&gt; hi</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:33:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, and zCommandUsername AND zCommandPassword are both set?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:33:07] &lt;Mousey&gt; is there anyway to run zenoss without zenoss-stack?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:33:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; Mousey: what do you mean, like stop and start it?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:33:44] &lt;Mousey&gt; like install just mysql + python + zenoss-core without having a whole "-stack" instance..</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:33:53] &lt;Mousey&gt; you know, By Hand(tm)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:33:54] &lt;twm1010&gt; absolutely</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:34:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; Mousey: yeh, install from source lol</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:34:27] &lt;Mousey&gt; oh. well i was hoping for more of an elegant solution than that, but ok</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:34:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; Mousey: the reason they bundle that stuff with it is because Zenoss relies on a specific version of Python</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:34:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; on the download page, you'll see RPM's and source, if you so choose</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:34:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; and bundling MySQL is because most people won't already have MySQL running on their server that they are installing Zenoss on</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:35:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you can duplicate the database structure in an existing MySQL instance and use that instead</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:35:43] &lt;Mousey&gt; &lt;rant&gt;crap.. i wish people would stop trying to make things "easy".. &lt;/rant&gt;</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:35:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; Mousey: yeh, the RPMs don't bundle that stuff either I don't believe</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:35:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never used the RPMs</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:36:02] &lt;Mousey&gt; rmatte: except i use debian and debian-derived distros</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:36:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; Mousey: what exactly are you trying to do?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:36:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; Mousey: You can still install an RPM on a debian derived distro, just use aptitude to install the RPM tools</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:36:29] &lt;Mousey&gt; i just want to run zenoss by itself</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:36:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; "by itself"?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:36:44] &lt;Mousey&gt; i HAVE a mysql server on the box, i don't want to waste resources by running another one</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:37:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, so like I said, you just need to duplicate Zenoss' MySQL structure on your existing MySQL server and away you go</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:37:20] &lt;Mousey&gt; rmatte: i could, but then i have an unauditable rpm database which can't be reconciled with dpkg's</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:37:36] &lt;Mousey&gt; and i trust alien about as far as i can throw it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:37:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:38:00] &lt;Mousey&gt; rmatte: i guess.. but extracting zenoss from the "-stack" just seems like more work than it should be</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:38:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; just follow the source install guide (the part where it shows the steps to setup the mysql database</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:38:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; just use those steps</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:38:23] &lt;Mousey&gt; so you're serious, install from source</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:38:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; the "stack" is just a startup script</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:38:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; you just need to modify it to not launch mysql</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:38:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; not terribly difficult</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:38:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; the problem is that upgrades will be a pain in the ass for you if you do it that way</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:39:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; you might as well just do it from source</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:39:08] &lt;Mousey&gt; not terribly, to install maybe, but to maintain, yes. zenoss versions quickly. i can't be doing source installs every time a new version is released</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:39:26] &lt;Mousey&gt; that's the whole point of package management</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:39:37] &lt;Mousey&gt; it's cool. it seems there's no good answer. i'll have to stick with something else..</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:39:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; How many devices are you going to be monitoring with it?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:40:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; do you really think the overhead of a contained MySQL instance is that high?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:40:15] &lt;Mousey&gt; rmatte: it doesn't matter really if i can't maintain the monitoring system</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:40:32] &lt;twm1010&gt; whats the difference between having one instance and another if the process is just going to open more threads as needed anyway?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:40:37] &lt;Mousey&gt; twm1010: yes, i don't get hardware for free, and i don't have a budget for more. i have to work with what i have</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:40:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; Mousey: I'm asking because if it's anything over like 150 devices you're going to want a dedicated box to run Zenoss on anyways</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:41:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; Mousey: monitoring is pretty resource consuming, and if the box you're installing it on isn't very beefy, even if you do manage to get it all running on one SQL server, it'll be really really hard on that system</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:41:38] &lt;Mousey&gt; i know, i've been running it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:41:47] &lt;Mousey&gt; but that's exactly why i had to stop</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:41:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; Mousey: Best practice when setting up a monitoring solution is to use a dedicated box</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:42:03] &lt;Mousey&gt; i couldn't get more out of the box without rearchitecting how it ran</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:42:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; regardless of what monitoring system you're using</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:42:19] &lt;Mousey&gt; best practices are for people with a budget</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:42:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; Even if it's a VM on a really beefy blade</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:42:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; Well, what are you running this on, a 386?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:43:07] &lt;twm1010&gt; 80/88, with nitrous.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:43:09] &lt;Mousey&gt; k. that sucks, i really liked the way zenoss handles snmp monitoring..</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:43:14] &lt;Mousey&gt; thanks y'all</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:43:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; a $300 low end desktop computer could make a decent Zenoss monitoring server</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:43:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm not gonna say it :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:43:29] &lt;straterra&gt; err</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:43:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; wow</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:43:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; Yeh, don't listen to the guys who do this for a living or anything</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:43:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:43:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; There's a six letter word starting with eff and ending in ort that he was missing.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:44:05] &lt;JROCK2004&gt;

no, it's simple</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:48:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; then click on the really really obscure "Add Fields" link that's in light grey on the right</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:48:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; find the ssh plugins on the right and drag them all over to the left</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:48:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; then click save</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:48:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; then model again</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:50:41] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; the ssh ones are the cmd ones right?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:51:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:52:43] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; they are already in the plugins</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:53:13] &lt;JROCK2004&gt;

no</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:57:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, instead of checking the class check the plugins right on the device itself</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 12:57:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; from the device page: More -&gt;

cool</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:41:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; who wrote it?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:41:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; also, the Plixxer ZenPack is coming to Core</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:41:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/product/plixer-scrutinizer">http://www.zenoss.com/product/plixer-scrutinizer</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:41:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; just got that in my inbox</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:43:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:44:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; scrutinizer is a pay app I assume?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:44:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I believe so</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:44:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; there's a free version I believe</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:45:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; like a demo version</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:45:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:45:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; going to check the pricing, could be quite useful...</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:46:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'll be sure to pass that along to Marketing :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:46:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

that looks like the free version (non-demo)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:47:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; does scrutinizer collect it's own data then separately?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:47:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; or does it pull from Zenoss?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:47:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:47:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; separate</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:47:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:48:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll definitely run it by my manager, it could be quite useful for troubleshooting network congestion and stuff</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:49:07] &lt;jb&gt; its just netflow..</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:50:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but I like the way that they are presenting the data</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:52:22] &lt;djack&gt; @mrayzenoss does it work the twill pack?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:52:32] * jb uses solarwinds for netflow :/</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:53:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; haven't tried it out yet, just working on build/doc issues so far</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:53:50] &lt;djack&gt; can i download it somewhere to play with it?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:54:08] &lt;djack&gt; webinject works fine exept it does not support the addheaders that i want....</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:55:07] &lt;djack&gt; I use the 2.4.5 version of zenoss</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 13:55:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

rmatte: stock one</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:35:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, weird</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:36:24] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; hmm well telnet is not connecting to it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:36:44] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; Ah wait I do not have port 35 open in the firewall for incoming</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:36:48] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; 25 I mean</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:37:00] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; that is probably why duh</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:51:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:53:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; you know what else sucks?&#160; you can't rename organizers</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:53:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; generally not an issue, but it does become annoying in certain situations</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:54:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; aha, you can do it from the zope management interface</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:55:53] &lt;djack&gt; rmatte how do you mean</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:58:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; you just navigate to Groups or whatever, then put /manage after the URL</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:58:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; and hit enter</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:58:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it'll bring you to ZMI</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:58:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you can put a checkmark next to the group and click Rename</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 14:59:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; You can do it for locations too</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:02:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; anyone want to provide a quote for the 2.5 press release?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:02:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:03:13] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; Did I read right that there is built in LDAP support in zenoss?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:03:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: well, you can get it working in the core version, but it's not as simple as just turning an option on</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:04:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; JROCK2004: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2510.html">docs/DOC-2510</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:04:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll see if I can dig up... and Matt beat me to it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:04:49] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; well I was looking more for how to monitor that it is up and running</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:04:55] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; not to use if for authentication</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:05:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

there it is thanks</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:09:10] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; well I think that LDAP addon just broke zenoss </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.ca/1630558">http://pastebin.ca/1630558</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:09:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; no</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:09:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to restart Zenoss after installing certain ZenPacks</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:09:35] &lt;cgibbons&gt; forgot the chicken blood</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:09:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; restart it and that problem should go away</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:10:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; ...and the chicken blood does help too</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:10:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; we should really make a chicken blood ZenPack</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:10:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; with MOAR PONIES</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:10:58] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; You guys are geniuses</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:11:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; we try</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:13:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; chicken blood? the wit in here is awesome :D</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:13:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; once again, we try</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:13:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:13:53] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; Yes you guys do lol</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:14:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: what kind of quote are you looking for?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:15:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; marketing is being a bit vague&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; something about how Zenoss Core and the Zenoss Community help you succeed :p</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:15:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; You could recycle my quote from the one million downloads :P</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:16:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; just kidding</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:16:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll see if I can come up with something</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:16:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that is a good quote :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:16:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:17:12] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; "MOAR PONIES"-rmate</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:17:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; err&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; "rmatte"</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:17:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:17:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; do it up</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:33:26] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; hi to all. How can I figure out why zenoss clears an event and almost immediately creates a new same event ( MySQL Error: (1045, "Access denied for user 'zenoss'@'my.company.net' (using password: YES)") )</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:34:16] JROCK2004_ is now known as JROCK2004</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:37:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:38:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; I wish folks would populate the Device Class description fields</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:38:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; so I know when a new one pops up in the distribution, what is special about it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:39:55] &lt;davetoo&gt; e.g. /Devices/Network/Cisco</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:41:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; ummm, that device class is standard</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:41:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it's been there for like the past 10 version</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:41:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; versions*</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:41:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:42:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: that sounds like it's being generated by a command based datapoint?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:42:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:42:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; 10?</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:42:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5494">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5494</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:42:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: zenpatch 15003</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:43:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; then restart Zenoss</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:43:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; maybe I trimmed it out of my 2.3.3 and forgot?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:43:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: It was DEFINITELY there in 2.3.3</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:43:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:43:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; well, I *do* have CRS</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:44:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; Now that brings back another question in my mind: the /Network/Router class</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:44:41] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; rmatte: thanks</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:44:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: no problem</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:46:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually...</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:46:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have /Network/Router/Cisco</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:46:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I think it's because I moved /Network/Cisco in to there</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:46:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; since it made more sense</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:46:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; I created a /Network/Router/Cisco</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:46:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; but the line between router and not-a-router grows fuzzier and fuzzier</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:47:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's why I created /Network/Switch/Cisco</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:47:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; and /Network/Wireless/Cisco</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:47:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; and copied the template to those</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:47:35] &lt;davetoo&gt; as did I (well not the Wireless)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:47:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; and made whatever modifications I needed to</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:47:48] &lt;etank&gt; is there a place to tell zenoss not to flatten the rrd graphs?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:47:57] &lt;etank&gt; or to wait a longer period before doing it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:48:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; etank: "flatten"?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:48:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:48:15] &lt;etank&gt; it seems that after 24 hours it starts to average the data</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:48:15] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; rmatte: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m41fe8e58">http://pastebin.com/m41fe8e58</a><span> what should I enter here?</span></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:48:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; I get what you mean, when it summarises the data</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:48:24] &lt;etank&gt; and makes the graphs flatten</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:48:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; etank:</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:48:28] &lt;etank&gt; rmatte: right</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:48:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; that is a fundamental principle of RRD operation</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:48:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; ummmm, lemme check</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:49:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; you could change the RRD file creation parameters</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:49:06] &lt;etank&gt; davetoo: i understand that but i would like to make it start after a greater priod of time</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:49:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; in Collectors</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:49:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; he basically wants to make it start summarizing after like a week instead of 24 hours</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:49:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; or whatever</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:49:33] &lt;etank&gt; i understand that it would take more disc space too but i can live with that</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:49:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; zport/dmd/Monitors/Performance/localhost/editPerformanceConf</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:49:43] &lt;etank&gt; rmatte: exactly</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:50:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; in the Default RRD Create Command there</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:50:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; you'll have to rm all of your existing rrd files for change to do anything</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:50:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; for existing devices, anyway</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:50:41] &lt;etank&gt; now i have to learn what those mean so i know what to change it to :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:50:55] &lt;etank&gt; davetoo: not a problem</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:51:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; I *think* there is a tool called rrdtune that could change existing files</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:52:13] &lt;etank&gt; is it documented in the zenoss docs what the Default RRD Create Command settings mean?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:53:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'd look for the RRDTool docs/tutorials on-lines</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:53:55] &lt;etank&gt; im there now</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:55:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually here's an example of how to use RRDtool on all current RRD files</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:55:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; find $ZENHOME/perf -name '*.rrd' -exec rrdtool tune "{}" -i ds0:U \;</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:55:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; just change the rrdtool parameters according to what you need</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:58:32] &lt;etank&gt; thanks rmatte and davetoo</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:58:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:58:39] &lt;etank&gt; i will look into it more</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:59:12] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; rmatte: re patch it asked a file... what should I enter there?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:59:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: is that machine not connected to the internet?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:59:43] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; rmatte: connected....</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 15:59:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you're the zenoss user?</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:00:03] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; rmatte: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m41fe8e58">http://pastebin.com/m41fe8e58</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:00:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: what version of Zenoss are you running?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:01:41] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; Zenoss 2.4.5, on&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;FreeBSD (i386) 7.1.0</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:01:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, FreeBSD, lovely</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:02:03] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:02:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; that may cause zenpatch not to work properly</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:02:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; try executing the command "patch"</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:02:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you able to?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:03:14] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; what should I get?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:03:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually nevermind</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:03:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; here's what you do...</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:03:30] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; I got nothing....</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:03:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; run zenpatch again for that patch</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:03:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's prompting you because it has no idea where the Auto.py file is apparently</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:03:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; find the file then paste the path in and hit enter</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:03:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it prompts you for any other files do the same</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:04:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; then restart Zenoss</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:04:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; hopefully that'll work</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:04:27] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; ok... I hope it doesn't broke anything :))))</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:04:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:04:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's all python, exact same files as you'd be running on Linux</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:04:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; so a little change shouldn't hurt anything</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:05:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; I like FreeBSD, it's just a pain to run Zenoss on</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:05:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:06:33] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; rmatte: it's true :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:07:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; It also doesn't get the same level of package support as Linux does in general</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:07:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I got tired of having to hack config files to compile stuff all the time</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:07:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; I remember having to actually edit KDE source code to get it to compile on FreeBSD back in the day</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:08:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok, devs, if anybody is still around...&#160; how can I run a datacollector/modeler plugin such that I can insert pdb breakpoints?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:08:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; rmatte: guys like you are the reason that stuff doesn't work on freebsd :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:08:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; You gave up</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:08:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:08:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: I did use FreeBSD as my only OS for 5 years, so I'd say I didn't give up too easily, wouldn't you?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:08:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm teasing</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:09:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:09:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:09:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; It's been my workhorse for a long timen</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:09:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I flopped over to Linux in College because I couldn't get the wireless card on the computer working in FreeBSD with encryption.&#160; It would work fine without encryption but it was useless.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:09:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; but I get frustrated at the linux-centric dependencies of new apps</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:09:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; Wireless card on my college laptop rather</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:09:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; davetoo: were you looking for something like Ian's comment about pb in this thread? </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../thread/10452.html">thread/10452</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:10:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; err&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; pdb</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:10:33] &lt;davetoo&gt; that's part of it...</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:10:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; Then the school switched to WPA so I had to hack on WPA supplicant until I figured out the school's WPA settings (trial and error) and then I wrote a bash script to make it braindead simple to use, packaged it up, and sent it out to the whole class</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:11:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was also the one who actually cracked the WEP keys (before they switched to WPA) when the sys admins refused to give them to us since we could see them in plaintext in Linux</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:11:17] Zenethian is now known as zenethian</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:11:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; they would only type them in to windows XP laptops</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:11:30] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: heh, I wrote the same thing for my school&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; only it was for dial-up :p</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:11:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; the issue&#160; is that the plugin is run from zenmodeler within Twisted (I think) so I don't have the tty</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:11:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: haha, nice</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:12:29] &lt;davetoo&gt; basically I need to figure out how to run, say, DataCollector/plugin/zenoss/snmp/InterfaceMap.py directly from a shell</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:12:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; or with some wrapper that still leaves me with the controlling terminal</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:12:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: you can technically just execute it but it won't do much lol</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:13:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; +OoVvirt</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:13:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; right, so at the moment I don't *want* to create objects and relations yet.</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:13:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; oops</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:13:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; trivVoO+</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:13:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; I just want&#160; to see what the snmp tables look like when GetTableMap creates them</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:13:40] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt;

ah</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:14:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure how you'd do that</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:14:09] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; :(</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:14:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd have to create a copy of InterfaceMap.py and mess around with defining values statically</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:14:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; then execute it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:14:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; or something</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:15:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm going to reply to my own forum post to clarify :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:15:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: hmmm</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:15:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: you are now entering bsd hell</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:15:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:16:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; "Hey, there's chuck!"</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:16:39] &lt;rmatte&gt;

RoundQube: and Gentoo on my home server</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:19:15] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte may i ask why the conversion?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:19:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: better package support, better hardware support (at the time)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:19:41] &lt;RoundQube&gt; usually bsd ppl are hard-core... more so than linux user's. I used all, openbsd, netbsd, freebsd, linux etc.. but just wondering</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:20:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; I used FreeBSD for 5 years, then in college I couldn't get my wireless card to work properly with FreeBSD (I tried for like 3 days), so I tried out Gentoo and I liked it a lot since it had a similar feel to FreeBSD</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:20:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I used Gentoo for a couple years, then eventually switched to Ubuntu when I got sick of it taking hours to compile packages</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:21:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; It would take like a full week to setup a FreeBSD or Gentoo desktop system</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:21:17] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte haha&#160; ya</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:21:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can setup a fully functional Ubuntu install in a couple hours</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:21:22] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; I believe that BSD is good for servers only.... not for home use...</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:21:41] &lt;straterra&gt; I use RHEL for servers..Windows or Gentoo for desktops</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:22:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; BSD works for home use, I used it as a desktop OS for 4 years (first year was commandline only)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:22:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's definitely not on par with Linux</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:22:59] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte commandline is nice but how do you surf the net?</span><br/><span><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:23:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; and if you really want to use BSD for desktop these days I'd hit up a project like: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://desktopbsd.net/">http://desktopbsd.net/</a></span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:23:05] &lt;RoundQube&gt; i mean graphically, you'd need that</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:23:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: I was 14 and I decided I was going to learn unix, so I bought an old computer off of ebay, downloaded FreeBSD and set it up next to my windows computer, then networked them together and used it for scripting and learning purposes only</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:24:13] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte thats the way to do it :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:24:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; then I eventually installed windowmaker on it (not sure if you've ever used that window manager before)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:24:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; screwed around with that for a bit</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; then eventually made my way to blackbox (which is now basically fluxbox)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; then made my way to KDE</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:08] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte of course i have</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I used KDE for ages</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:16] &lt;RoundQube&gt; im a E fantatic though now</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've been using gnome lately</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; E?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; drugs are bad</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:36] &lt;RoundQube&gt; Enlightenment</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:40] &lt;RoundQube&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, right</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:46] &lt;RoundQube&gt; Enlightenment is indeed a drug</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:25:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've used Enlightenment a few times</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:26:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; I looked at it and found it to be a gigantic memory and cpu cycle pig</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:26:06] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; I'm waiting for kFreeBSD.... it's debian with the core of freebsd</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:26:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; and banished it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:26:12] &lt;RoundQube&gt; im actually using Elive (debian+enlightenment) distro on my MSI Wind U123</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:26:23] &lt;RoundQube&gt; i have CentOS for Zenoss</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:26:53] &lt;RoundQube&gt; davetoo it is but if you got the memory and cpu cycles...=)</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:27:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I actually prefer Ubuntu for Zenoss</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:27:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not a fan of RedHat, CentOS, and the likes</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:28:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have to admit though, kde4 is getting fairly sexy</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 16:29:16] &lt;rmatte&gt;

our netowrk is 90% cisco</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:07:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; no, I just forgot to change the numeric OID in the code I copied to test from</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:07:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; kobalt: any Nexus boxes yet?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:07:49] &lt;davetoo&gt; I can't believe people aren't clamoring for proper modern cisco CPU monitoring</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:08:04] &lt;kobalt&gt; davetoo: no nexus boxes</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:08:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; I've seen some brief indications in forum posts that people might be working on the same thing, but I haven't found a zenpack</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:08:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; nor changes to the core, to monitor multiple CPUs</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:09:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; NX-OS doesn't yet have an SNMP agent that's useful to zenoss</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:09:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; no ip routes, no ip address tables</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:09:37] &lt;kobalt&gt; davetoo: I cant believe we are the only ones that want to know exactly when a node/interface clears</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:09:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; clears?</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:10:02] &lt;kobalt&gt; davetoo: Im trying to figure out a workaround for zenoss autoclearing events</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:10:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh,</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:10:52] &lt;kobalt&gt; yeah if I have a interface go down and then clear a minute later... we are proactive and call our customers and let them know, but with zenoss at default we would not see that event</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:10:57] &lt;kobalt&gt; cause it auto clears it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:11:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; hmm, I was poking around in that area but don't remember how that might be done</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:11:20] &lt;kobalt&gt; I can set the severity to anything other then clear easily</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:11:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; if it can be done without hacking the code</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:12:10] &lt;kobalt&gt; I just do a transform, if severity == 0 then severity = 3</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:12:42] &lt;kobalt&gt; but with a node down, it does not start graphing the device till the status ping down event goes away</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:13:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; that is mostly to avoid snmp timeouts</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:13:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; but doesn't take into account a busy router de-prioritizing icmp</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:13:43] &lt;kobalt&gt; right, but the trigger for the monitoring is not the up clear event, its the down</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:14:06] &lt;kobalt&gt; I have mine set to ping 4 times with a 1.5 sec wait</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:14:15] &lt;kobalt&gt; so I normally dont get icmp drops</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:14:45] &lt;kobalt&gt; but when it pings up, it does not clear the down and so snmppref does not resume graphing it</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:14:46] &lt;kobalt&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:14:53] &lt;kobalt&gt; I cant win for loosing</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 18:17:02] &lt;kobalt&gt; so im trynig to get it to pop up a window with the event info (like when you click on the magnifing glass) but no luck as of yet</span><br/><span> [19-Oct-2009 19:57:36] &lt;AlexGC&gt;

though that really shouldn't affect it here</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 08:45:56] &lt;whitemice&gt; twm1010&gt; Ok, I switched it to gauge and resequenced the graph points.&#160; Hmm, now it shows a current value of 147.28m</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 08:46:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; i think its just a formatting issue</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 08:46:30] &lt;twm1010&gt; all absolute would have done was make negative values positive, shouldn't have changed the datapoint</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 08:46:57] &lt;whitemice&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 08:47:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; I think the graphpoint format is changing the displayed value</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 08:48:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; under the graphpoint format people have had me remove the second % sign before, though I haven't bothered to look up the formatting of the graph points yet</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 08:49:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; that might be a rather blind stab in the dark on my part</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 08:51:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; in fact pull %s off the graphpoint entirely</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 08:53:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; ok, the default is %5.2lf%s&#160;&#160; which means left to right&#160;&#160; 5 places to the left of the decimal, two places to the right, scale accordingly with SI magnitude</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 08:53:32] &lt;twm1010&gt; so fi you don't want to scale it, just remove %s</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 09:00:03] &lt;whitemice&gt; just " %5.2lf" yields 0.29</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 09:01:11] &lt;whitemice&gt; hmmm, in Python that works.&#160; print '%5.2lf' % 87 =&gt; 87.00</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 09:03:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; those are fairly different values there</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 09:04:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; are you sure the OID you tested and the OID it's grabbing are the same?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 09:04:14] &lt;whitemice&gt;

I never knew this app existed until then</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:22:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: hehe, spread the word!</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:22:27] &lt;whitemice&gt; i heard about it at Ohio LinuxFest</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:22:57] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; trust me. I will blog about this and have been posting twitter message :)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:23:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:24:36] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; I think I will be attending the training session in Baltimore next month as well</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:24:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; I find it very difficult to get people interested in this for some reason</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:24:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; and if they've ever used Nagios, they seem to stick to their guns</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:25:02] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; The fear comes from change</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:25:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, we have some Nagios fanboys around here, but they are older guys who are stuck in their ways</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:25:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; It wasn't until I showed somebody how I could use multi-graph to simultaneously show border router traffic next to IIS/Apache performance that someone said, now thats cool.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:26:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; "Why aren't we using Nagios!?&#160; Nagios never breaks!", "Because I can do ten times as much work as I can in Nagios in a fraction of the time", "Pffffft, Nagios, Nagios, Nagios"</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:26:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; bbl</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:26:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:26:58] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; Here is where zenoss beats nagios from what I have seen so far...... If you have servers that are old and you cannot find repositories for then nagios is useless</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:27:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; Well, the really weak point in Zenoss is the reports system</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:27:19] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; for example when I started as IT guy here at my company they have servers running Fedora Core 4</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:27:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not nearly dynamic enough, and as it currently stands it's buggy (but I think most of the bugs will be fixed for King Crab)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:27:42] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; I could not get everything setup to install the nrpe plugin</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:28:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:28:12] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; zenoss will allow you SSH into the box and run commands</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:28:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:28:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; comes in handy</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:29:05] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; Another thing I saw at the conference is you can setup zenoss to monitor your printer and let you know ink tones and paper avaliablity</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:29:19] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; I have not dove into that one yet but I thought that was cool</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:29:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:29:24] &lt;jb&gt; its just SNMP</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:29:25] &lt;jb&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:29:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; a community member wrote then zenpack for that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:29:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; the*</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:29:49] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; jb: this is tru</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:30:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; that's a good zenpack, too. very well done.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:30:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; Monitoring printers is the last thing that I'll be doing with Zenoss lol, but it is cool that it's possible</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:30:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; I would have setup Zenoss just for that purpose at my old job</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:30:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:31:39] &lt;cgibbons&gt; rmatte, if you had a reporting system that could do anything you wanted, how much of the data would you need immediately/on-demand, versus say summarized the next day, etc. for trending?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:31:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: quite honestly, pretty much all of it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:32:01] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i.e. how much is operational reporting versus planning reporting?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:32:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: management always wants the ability to do both for everything</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:32:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should be able to have scheduled reports as well as on-demand for whatever you want</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:33:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: I've been meaning to draw up some rough UI layouts and explanations for how I envision the reporting system should be, and what types of reports are currently missing from it.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:34:07] &lt;cgibbons&gt; there's always the reality that on-demand operational reports can impact the collection system itself, so heavy duty reporting should be relatively off-line using a separate datastore. that doesn't eliminate the use-cases for what i call operational reporting, since they can be used for really different purposes.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:34:27] &lt;cgibbons&gt; but someone running a report should never impact data collection or eventing, imo, no matter what.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:34:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: correct, but the users should have the option to lock that down if they wish</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:34:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: it's better to provide more functionality rather than less and let the users draw the line</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:35:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: If someone wants to setup a ridiculously beefy system for on-demand reporting capability then they should be able to</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:35:30] &lt;cgibbons&gt; hmm i disagree with that, based on lots of experience with the problem. that's not what happens. :) it's better to have less functionality that just works, especially when you start having to support said users who want it all but don't provide hardware requirements to it.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:35:55] &lt;cgibbons&gt; every one of the big 4 installations i've seen has had this issue with users wanting to grab as much data as they can out of the real time data collection system and wondering why it's killing it. reporting should never be done off an operational data store.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:36:05] &lt;cgibbons&gt; (big 4 vendors in this context)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:36:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: I suppose that it depends on what kinds of users you're dealing with, the enhanced reporting would really be more beneficial to MSPs and such rather than the guy who wants to monitor his 15 servers</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:36:52] &lt;cgibbons&gt; what kind of reports do you find the most useful, if they existed?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:37:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, first off it would be very nice if the reports system were more modular.&#160; you should be able to piece together a report from several reports that are available</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:38:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; as for types of reports, very similar to what's currently available with the option to add custom reports to some degree (similar to what you can do now with a bit more flexibility)...</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:38:45] &lt;cgibbons&gt; blue sky i mean, ignore zenoss's existence. :) if you had complete power over any data, you'd need reports X, Y, and Z to do your job... ?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:39:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; the main problems that we have with Zenoss from a reporting standpoint are the following...</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:39:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not possible to provide a report on interface availability, or application/service availability</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:39:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; which almost every client asks us for</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:39:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's also not possible to provide a report on bandwidth utilization (in textual format)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:40:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; or throughput utilization for the timeframe specified</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:41:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; (asking my coworkers if they can think of any others as they had mentioned a few to me as well)...</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:42:10] &lt;cgibbons&gt; bandwidth is always a good one. would interface availability really be what you're after, or more the higher-level links (if such an entity existed)?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:42:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; interface availability for any interfaces being monitored</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:42:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; all interfaces</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:42:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; as any interface being monitored is of interest</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:43:30] &lt;chudler&gt; reporting in general on sub-components was a problem for me, IIRC</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:43:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; It would also be exceptionally nice if you could use the UI to piece together a bunch of reports in to a single report</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:43:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; we're having to code our own report from scratch to do that, and it's extremely time consuming</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:43:51] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:44:12] &lt;cgibbons&gt; would it be better if the data was available in a standard (SQL) format and you could use your favorite reporting tool for that?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:44:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should be able to throw a report together that shows top 10 devices by (lack of) availability, top 10 interfaces by utilization, stuff like that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:44:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; It would honestly be better if you could piece a report together, generate it, and have it output as pdf</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:44:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; with all of the graphics and everything</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:44:55] &lt;chudler&gt;

One of my coworkers was trying out zyrion the other day...</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:46:11] &lt;chudler&gt; For me, it would suffice to have them in SQL or something and plug it into an existing report manager we have around here</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:46:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; The way that you can piece reports together and stuff in zyrion is pretty much the way I'd envision it working in Zenoss</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:46:32] DaveToo is now known as davetoo</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 10:47:23] &lt;cgibbons&gt;

it also has better debugging</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:04:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; Am I making sense?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:04:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:05:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: erm, hmmm</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:05:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; "to conform to the template based on the collection interval"</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:05:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; had you right up until that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:05:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:05:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; well, the datapoint is for total accesses right?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:05:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:06:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; but the template that comes with the zenpack, graphs that datapoint in requests/sec</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:06:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; even though its collected every 300 seconds</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:06:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; so its gotta be dividing the derived value by the collection interval</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:07:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:07:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it will be</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:07:35] &lt;twm1010&gt; but thats not what I want to graph, I want to graph connections within the timeframe next to the bandwidth being used</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:07:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe use a different data source type?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:08:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm really not sure, I'd have to literally have it in front of me</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:08:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's hard to do this sort of stuff off the top of your head hehe</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:08:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm pretty sure I can just multiply it by 300 again</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:09:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; that would probably work</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:09:28] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; does the zenoss DB generate a random password for its user?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:09:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah, I had to do that with the traffic too</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:10:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, trying to think of what else I need to apply to the Zenoss servers during my change window tonight</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:10:19] &lt;rmatte&gt;

All networks show up and when I dig down deeper into other networks, the devices and routes to them are there correctly</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:35:03] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte thanks anyhow, ill keep digging :)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:35:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah mine tied to my google apps domain login</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:35:14] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; my company is using the gmail email hosting. The API wants me to log in with the standard gmail account</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:35:18] &lt;twm1010&gt; didn't seem to be an issue</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:36:02] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; twm1010: I click on the link from zenoss. I put my domain name in. Then it takes me to a login screen</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:36:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: just sign up for your own gmail account or something, doesn't matter what account you use to generate the API key</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:36:41] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; I guess I could create a dummy account on gmail</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:36:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I created my own account just for the purpose of generating API keys</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:37:22] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; now here is a question does it matter that zenoss can only communicate to the outside and not inside?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:37:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; no</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:38:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's the one initiating the connection with the google maps API</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:38:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; the google maps API isn't the one initiating the connection with it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:38:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; ;)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:39:12] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; so its cool that the domain I enter is not on the box that zenoss is</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:39:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; well... hold on there</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:39:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; the zenoss server doesn't hit google</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:40:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually yeh, the workstation hits google</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:40:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; your browser does, using the API key you receive from your zenoss server</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:40:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's irrelevant</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:40:13] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok cool</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:40:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: you have to put the exact URL that you're hitting the Zenoss server on in</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:40:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; like </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://myserver:8080">http://myserver:8080</a></span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:40:36] &lt;twm1010&gt; right, so the referring URL should be your zenoss server, and the API key corresponds to it, and goes to google with that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:40:48] &lt;twm1010&gt; at least, thats how my brain figured it</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:40:56] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; so I would have to get my outside IP and do </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://myip:8080">http://myip:8080</a></span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:41:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; noooooo</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:41:15] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok it can be internal ip</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:41:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; you put EXACTLY what you see in the url bar when you hit your server</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:41:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; no, use your internal hostname or IP</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:41:30] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; kk</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:41:33] &lt;RoundQube&gt; JROCK2004 i use my internal IP just fine</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:41:35] &lt;JROCK2004&gt;

does zenoss use nmap?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:52:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; is that how it does its IP port scanning?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:53:03] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; From the Summary table, next to Address, click Edit I do not see a summary table after I click on Locations</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 12:58:54] &lt;jb&gt;

fine so far but i am still learning</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:00:20] &lt;jb&gt; We.re happy to announce that Zenoss Community member Juerg Gerber has written a new Puppet module that automatically adds servers managed by Puppet into Zenoss</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:00:22] &lt;jb&gt; ugh</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:00:23] &lt;cwj&gt; not managing production systems yet</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:00:26] &lt;jb&gt; that does the opposite</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:00:40] &lt;jb&gt; i want to use zenoss as a DB for managing puppet nodes</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:02:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; What is Puppet?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:03:03] &lt;ckrough&gt; jb: are you thinking of applying recipes based on zenoss /Class?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:03:10] &lt;ckrough&gt; twm1010: configuration management for linux</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:03:13] &lt;cwj&gt; twm1010: puppet and chef are frameworks for configuration management</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:03:15] &lt;jb&gt; that would be very cool.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:03:19] &lt;jb&gt; at the very least, add them as puppet nodes</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:03:28] &lt;ckrough&gt; jb: yeah, hmm</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:03:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; kind of like... tripwire?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:04:07] &lt;twm1010&gt; keeps track of changes?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:04:12] &lt;cwj&gt; twm1010: no, kind of like cfengine</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:04:17] &lt;ckrough&gt; twm1010: no, pushes changes</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:04:32] &lt;ckrough&gt; twm1010: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://reductivelabs.com/">http://reductivelabs.com/</a></span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:04:35] &lt;twm1010&gt; ah, like radminD is used to manage macs?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:04:49] &lt;ckrough&gt; MSI+GPO for WIndows, sorta</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:05:03] &lt;jb&gt; ckrough: im just starting with pup.. but i already see the advantage to storing node definitions in a database or what have you</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:05:10] &lt;jb&gt; other than in manifests directly</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:05:20] &lt;cwj&gt; jb: fwiw chef already stores node data in a database</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:05:22] &lt;cwj&gt; couchdb</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:05:32] &lt;jb&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:05:39] &lt;cwj&gt; i will probably be storing zenoss class as an attribute</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:05:45] &lt;ckrough&gt; I need to look at Chef. Puppet does ldap for external nodes typically</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:05:58] &lt;jb&gt; you are using LDAP?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:06:10] &lt;ckrough&gt; nah. using a nodes file</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:06:27] &lt;jb&gt; i was thinking of mysql</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:06:35] &lt;jb&gt; and maybe some perl to extract info and feed it to pup</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:06:46] &lt;jb&gt; and a simple web frontend to manage the nodes</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:06:52] &lt;jb&gt; but tieing this into zen would be even better</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:07:25] &lt;ckrough&gt; doing puppet training next month, Ill ask some questions about that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:07:36] &lt;jb&gt; ok cool</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:07:41] &lt;jb&gt; let me know how that goes :)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:08:11] &lt;ckrough&gt; cwj: have you used both chef and puppet?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:09:03] &lt;cwj&gt; ckrough: i began mucking about in puppet first but decided to move to chef before i got a lot further</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:09:18] &lt;jb&gt; for what reasons?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:09:37] &lt;ckrough&gt; I think chef is a fork of puppet, right?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:09:56] &lt;cwj&gt; chef uses real ruby for its DSL. puppet uses mostly-ruby-but-sortof-not</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:10:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; it basically works by first establishing a baseline, and implement/pushing changes on top of the baseline image?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:10:13] &lt;jb&gt; they are both ruby</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:10:14] &lt;cwj&gt; and i have friends who are deep into puppet now and running into limitations</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:10:15] &lt;jb&gt; which sucks :)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:10:36] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; I always wanted to use puppet. But in ubuntu world puppet client never started for me</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:11:21] &lt;ckrough&gt; twm1010: you define roles like 'webserver' or 'mail server' then define the components of those things like 'ssh access' 'ssl certs' etc, then just tell puppet that server x is a 'webserver' and puppet does all the installs and configuration</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:11:48] &lt;RoundQube&gt; im not really understanding the concept of puppett or chef</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:11:48] &lt;RoundQube&gt; but then again, i peeked at it for 5 mins hehe</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:11:53] &lt;ckrough&gt; twm1010: easy to scale out and easy to maintain compliance across systems</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:12:00] &lt;jb&gt; you basically define resources/policies for nodes.. like "/etc/passwd should always be owned by root:root and 0644"</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:12:08] &lt;jb&gt; or box1.domain.com should ALWAYS have httpd installed and enabled</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:12:31] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; RoundQube: ok think of it this way. You have 20 workstations that are all setup the same way. Instead of going to every machine and setting it up you can setup puppet to do the work for you</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:12:35] &lt;jb&gt; the client checks in to the "puppetmaster" every 30 minutes by default.. and changes are made if needed</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:12:57] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; RoundQube: puppet tells the workstation what they should have and if they do not ahve it then the master gives it to them</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:12:57] &lt;ckrough&gt; so when you forget to disable it during maintenance.... it 'fixes' the problem :)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:12:58] &lt;RoundQube&gt; it does installations and configurations?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:13:02] &lt;ckrough&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:13:07] &lt;ckrough&gt; and more</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:13:22] &lt;RoundQube&gt; interesting... assuming for linux only?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:13:24] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; that is why I wish I could get it to work for me on my boxes cause that app rocks</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:13:24] &lt;RoundQube&gt; *nix</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:13:40] &lt;jb&gt; no not for linux only</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:13:40] &lt;ckrough&gt; RoundQube: aye</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:13:42] &lt;jb&gt; yes, for unix</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:13:43] &lt;ckrough&gt; really?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:13:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; ah, so you would combine puppet with some kind of image deployment system</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:13:50] &lt;cwj&gt; i think puppet and chef primarily support linux and solaris</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:14:08] &lt;ckrough&gt; twm1010: yep, I use KickStart</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:14:08] &lt;jb&gt; i'll be using it with AIX too</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:14:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; the image gets dropped on the new server, puppet takes over and deploys.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:14:09] &lt;jb&gt; for some things</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:14:20] &lt;jb&gt; kickstart the server, and then have puppet configure it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:14:20] &lt;RoundQube&gt; i manage linux servers only but only a few so not really necessary for me but windows desktops, there are too many</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:14:31] &lt;RoundQube&gt; need a nice opensource peice of software to figure that out</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:14:35] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, i don't believe we have enough like systems to utilize that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:14:38] &lt;cwj&gt; twm1010: even more appealing with virtualization. i am targeting vmware but chef developers have a lot of support for ec2</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:14:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; still, would be cool</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:14:44] &lt;ckrough&gt; I would say 10+ is worth it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:15:08] &lt;ckrough&gt; xen + kickstart + puppet</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:15:23] &lt;ckrough&gt; throw a web based front end on it and start a 'cloud'</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:15:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; sorry, was away for a bit, back now</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:16:41] &lt;cwj&gt; this is a pretty cool screencast demonstrating the new search capabilities in the upcoming version of chef: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://blog.opscode.com/blog/2009/10/07/preview-chef-0-8-and-the-opscode-platform/">http://blog.opscode.com/blog/2009/10/07/preview-chef-0-8-and-the-opscode-platform/</a></span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:16:49] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; jb: do you have pupper setup on any ubuntu machines</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:17:03] &lt;jb&gt; no, but i don't see that it would be difficult</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:17:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think you mean puppet?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:17:25] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; rmatte: yes lol :)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:17:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 13:17:52] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; jb: yeah the docs just stink for ubuntu and puppet.

also for the release candidate ?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:07:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; djack: yeah, you can test with the RC</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:07:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; upgrades that is</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:08:15] &lt;djack&gt; mrayzenoss well i have stress test the day after tomorrow ... i'll wait for that :-p</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:08:58] &lt;djack&gt; maybe test it on the demo server first ....</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:09:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; unless a P1 comes in against the RC build, this could be the release</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:09:10] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; rmatte: zentestcommand &#226;&#8364;&ldquo;d DeviceName --datasource=DataSourceName</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:10:22] &lt;rmatte&gt;

that is the command I tried to run and I get a errors about the device and datasource</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:11:55] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; I am sure I am messing up that command somehow</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:12:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, no lol</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:12:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; click on the data source in the UI</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:12:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll see an input field and a button marked "Test"</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:12:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; enter a device name in to the input field</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:12:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; then click test</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:13:23] &lt;djack&gt; is it easy to limit the amount of alerts ?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:13:24] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; is data sources on the left nav bar</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:13:41] &lt;djack&gt; JROCK2004 in the template it self</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:13:50] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; k</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:14:08] &lt;djack&gt; click on the data source under the command you can run a test</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:15:24] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok I am in the apache template now looking for your test button</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:15:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; click on the data source</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:16:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; djack: limit the amount of alerts in/for what?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:18:00] &lt;djack&gt; rmatte i have a script that checks logfile every 5 minuts currently i get mails every 5 minutes when something is wrong what i want is one mail with the alert and every 30 minutes an reminder mail or when event clear an OK mail</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:18:57] &lt;djack&gt; rmatte i think it should be easy but the simple things dont seem to work for me :-p</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:21:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; djack: have you tried just editing your repeat time for the alert rule?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:21:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; It sounds like you have repeat time set as 300 seconds</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:21:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you need to bump it up to 1800 seconds</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:21:59] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; rmatte: I am not seeing the test button like you are talking about</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:22:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: right under the data source in the template</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:22:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; click on the data source on the template page</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:22:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; the test button should be right there</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:22:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; "Test Against Device"</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:23:00] &lt;rmatte&gt;

yeah and it shows the name and sourcetype</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:25:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; and that's it?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:25:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; screenshot it</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:25:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

kind of useless without it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:26:41] &lt;kobalt&gt; JROCK2004: what did you call your data source ?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:27:05] &lt;kobalt&gt; JROCK2004: and is the name a clickable link?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:27:09] &lt;JROCK2004&gt;

Ah, it's because it's an apachemonitor type data source</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:28:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I didn't realize that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:28:32] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; no</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:28:43] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; yeah this is from a zenpack</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:28:51] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; that no was a mistake</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:28:59] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:29:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you absolutely positive that apache is reachable by just putting in the source IP?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:29:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; erm, device IP</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:29:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; rather than a specific hostname?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:29:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:29:41] &lt;djack&gt; you could test that from the cli of the zenoss machine</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:29:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; apache can be monitored by IP</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:29:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you're able to hit /server-status?auto</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:29:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:29:55] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; apache - slot usage works</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:30:39] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; yes I can hit the server-status auto</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:31:10] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; when I look at the page there is a bunch of ........</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:31:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you can hit it from the Zenoss server itself?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:32:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could always try enabling the Use SSH option</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:32:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; that may work better for you</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:32:18] &lt;twm1010&gt; hold on</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:33:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:33:35] &lt;twm1010&gt; login as Zenoss user</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:34:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; cd to $ZENHOME/ZenPacks/ZenPacks.zenoss.ApacheMonitor-2.0.2-py2.4.egg/ZenPacks/zenoss/ApacheMonitor/libexec</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:34:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; run ./check_apache.py -H yourIP -p yourPort -u /server-status?auto</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:35:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; and see what it brings back</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:35:24] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok looking to see where they stored the home dir for the zenoss</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:35:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; become the zenoss user and cd to $ZENHOME</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:35:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; it always corresponds to the zenoss home directory</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:35:58] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; got it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:36:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; basically run the collection script manually and see if all the values are coming back, very useful</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:36:30] &lt;twm1010&gt; if your using the default template I think you can run a zencommand to do that too</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:36:32] &lt;twm1010&gt; but i do it this way</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:36:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; err zentestcommand</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:37:09] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; STATUS OK</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:37:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; Are all the values there?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:37:40] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; well some are 0</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:37:53] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; slotLogging=0</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:37:56] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; like that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:38:04] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; bot some do have values</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:38:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; Well, how do you know they're not truly zero, is this webserver busy? :)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:38:29] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; it can be</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:38:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; but is it right now? why not let it run for a half-day and see if things start showing up</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:38:48] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok I see what you are saying</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:38:57] &lt;twm1010&gt; most of those counters are derived from total counters, therefore no traffic = no values</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:39:01] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; the missing rrd file might only be because the server is too busy</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:39:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: because even if it is showing 0 it should still graph</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:39:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; he should have an RRD and a graph with 0 as the value, instead of "nan" or not existing at all</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:39:35] &lt;twm1010&gt; perhaps, but NAN shows up until the 3rd polling cycle is complete doesn't it?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:40:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:40:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; but he's been troubleshooting this issue for about 2 hours now</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:40:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; oh :)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:40:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I'd have to believe that 3 polling cycles have been completed at this point</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:40:30] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; rmatte: oh my word has it been that long</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:40:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:40:32] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:40:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: close to, yeh</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:41:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; well, zenoss only records what the web page provides</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:41:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; run the script a few times, see if the numbers are changing</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:41:49] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=30uwd35&amp;s=4">http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=30uwd35&amp;s=4</a></span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:41:57] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; that is a pic of my grphs</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:42:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; we need "dynamic" reporting, the ability to set up a multigraph report with a filter so we can say "include only devices that exceeded this threshold during the past week" or "include only devices with critical events in the past week".</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:42:44] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; some of the numbers are changing but the 0 staty the same</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:43:23] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; slotGracefullyFinishing=0 slotReadingRequest=0 slotLogging=0</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:43:36] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; those are some that are always staying at 0</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:44:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; im not using stock templates but here are screenshots from mine</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:44:14] &lt;twm1010&gt;

hrmm... maybe you need to look at your mod_status configuration</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:45:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; perhaps its not setup to provide those values right</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:45:59] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; I was looking at the server-status I saw this</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:46:01] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; To obtain a full report with current status information you need to use the ExtendedStatus On directive.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:46:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; i know there is an extended mode that provides a ton more info, but that shouldn't be needed</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:46:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; turn that on and see if it makes it work</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:46:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; can't hurt</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:48:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; extended mode provides a lot of good information</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:48:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; I wish I could pull some more intelligence from it, like show the top requested URL's and such</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:49:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; davetoo: re: dynamic reporting, but how to know what components of those systems to graph?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:49:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a plugin on my wordpress blog that does that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:49:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's pretty neat, even shows you what the person searched for on the search engine that they came to the site from</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:50:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah, well we get stuff like that from some of our reporting providers and such, im sure they are tying into something on our webservers to get the data, i just don't know what</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:50:11] &lt;twm1010&gt; mod_status is the best I can do, and Im getting quite a bit from it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:50:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; You'd set it up like a normal graph, components and such,</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:50:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; and then apply the device filter</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:50:32] &lt;twm1010&gt; but the reports we pay for bring us stuff like, unique visitors, guests, against orders placed and such</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:50:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; really good stuff</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:50:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; but i'm on the flipside of it trying to show how hard the webservers and routers are working</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:50:53] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; Do I add the ExtendedStatus On to the server-status directory in apache config?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:51:20] &lt;twm1010&gt; the best I've been able to do is show page requests, which doesn't really translate to # of visitors</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:51:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; one old grandma clicking like mad through our website might register 25 pages between polling cycles</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:51:42] &lt;dollarbang1&gt; test of the "enter" key transposed as New Line....please ignore</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:51:42] &lt;dollarbang1&gt; it worked.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:51:52] &lt;dollarbang1&gt; but it sends two lines.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:52:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yeh, but then again page requests translate to processing time</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:52:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; JROCK2004:&#160; I'm not sure, I've never had to config the apache side the servers i'm monitoring were already setup for hobbit to monitor them via mod_status so i just tagged along</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:53:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; though, it did take me half a day to get out of our unix admins that they changed the default URL for mod_status</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:53:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: google for that option</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:53:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; (grr)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:53:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll probably find where to put it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:54:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; Unix admins can be such douchebags</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:54:05] * rmatte whistles</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:54:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; davetoo: so what you need are dynamic collections</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:54:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; Too bad I am one :O</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:54:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; I wonder, could you use a transform to place a device into a "group" called trouble servers</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:55:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; if a certain type of event is received</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:56:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yeh, you could</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:56:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd need to figure out how to move a device to a group in zendmd for starters</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:57:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; it's not about moving, it's about manipulating a zProperty</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:57:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; I wrote a tool to do that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:58:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; erm, sorry, not exactly</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 14:59:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; it's a collection of relations</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:00:29] &lt;davetoo&gt; dev.getDeviceGroupNames() and dev.setGroups()</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:02:20] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok well adding the extendedstatus gave me more graphs but still getting the rrd file issue with the apache_cpuLoad</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:02:51] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; I will give it a few minutes to let the new data populate to see if it fixes itself</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:04:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; is cpuLoad even one of the pieces of data available on the status page?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:04:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:04:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:04:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; but it will be a very low value unless the server is getting absolutely blasted</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:04:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; i don't think any of my servers have hit 1% for that value</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:06:01] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; well let me put it to you this way. The company I work for like the cheapest hardware. I would like these graphs to prove to them why you need to by good stuff</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:06:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; Your either going to be surprised, or disappointed.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:07:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; You'd be surprised what you can do with crap hardware</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:07:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol, one guy came in here one day and explained that his company had bought like 80 of these POS D-Link switches, and that he needed to monitor them with Zenoss</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:07:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; hah</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:07:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm glad that we actually buy good stuff here</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:07:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; For instance, we've still got a Groupwise post office with 300 users and a 200+GB mail database, its also serving up 1TB of fileserver data via a 10 year old SAN. It's got dual 400mhz processors</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:07:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; though our purchasing department tries to screw us sometimes</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:07:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; hows that hit ya? :)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:09:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; we ordered a server with 32 gigs of RAM in it, and the purchaser figure "What could they possibly need 32 gigs of RAM for?&#160; I'm just going to go ahead and use my personal expertice as a purchaser (not as a systems admin or anything mind you) to determine that they only need 8 gigs of RAM and order it with just 8 gigs"</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:09:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; my boss totally flipped when he found out</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:09:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; VMware host?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:09:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; or is this your super zenoss box?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:10:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; "When we tell you to order a server with 32 gigs of RAM, that is EXACTLY what we mean for you to do!"</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:10:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:10:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; hah, what vendor</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:11:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; well the server was HP, but we're an HP partner, so the purchaser who placed the order was one of our employees</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:11:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:11:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; It was our employee's fault, not HPs</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:12:22] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; well the cpuLoad issue is no longer showing the error</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:12:36] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; so it looks like the Extendedstatus worked</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:12:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; good</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:12:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll have to remember that one hehe</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:13:17] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; yeah just enable that which that goes in the http.conf. Then give it about 5 minutes</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:13:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:14:02] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; and twm1010 was right. It is showing .07</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:14:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:14:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; as long as it's showing something</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:14:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:14:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; I hate svn tree conflicts</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:15:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; svn, a subject i've not really given any attention to</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:15:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; its a package control system right?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:15:14] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; oh so on the hardware thing. We have about a 1000 customers who hit this site. The bosses did not understand why we need a quad core 8GB of RAM. I personally would have like more but we have to fight to get that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:15:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; source control</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:15:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; svn is used when you're developing stuff, it tracks changes to the code</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:15:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; so that you can see what has changed between different commited versions of files</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:15:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; JROCK2004: I think you'll find some good data there.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:16:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; JROCK2004: the stock template doesn't track idleServers and busyServers</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:16:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; busyServers is a good thing to track</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:16:59] &lt;djack&gt; is ther an awk specialist here ?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:17:09] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:17:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; djack: what are you trying to do?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:18:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; so, edit the "apache" datasource, and add those two as gauge type datapoints</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:18:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; and then create a graph to show them</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:18:10] &lt;djack&gt; well something silly again :-p i need to count lines in a logfile .... that work but when they don't match the output need to be 0 currently it is nothing ...</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:18:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; you mean if it finds absolutely no lines you want it to output "0"?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:18:50] &lt;djack&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:19:14] &lt;djack&gt; i don't know how the datasource would react if there is no imput ....&#160; so best to set 0</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:19:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; how are you currently counting the lines?&#160; with something like: cat bleh.log | grep whatever | wc -l?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:19:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; or are you doing it in python?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:20:20] &lt;djack&gt; ERROR=`awk '$0&gt;=from&amp;&amp;$0&lt;=to' from="${BACK}" to="${NOW}" ${LOGFILE} | awk ' $3 ~ /ERROR/ {++e} ; END { print e }'`</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:20:40] &lt;djack&gt; and in this case 0 is a good thing :-p</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:20:51] &lt;djack&gt; bash shell script</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:20:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so you're doing it based on time?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:21:00] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; twm1010: once I add those data points I need to create a new graph for them correct?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:21:11] &lt;djack&gt; rmatte yep</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:21:23] &lt;djack&gt; it goes back 5 minutes ..... so i have the full 24 hours</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:22:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you're only counting lines that contain ERROR?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:22:17] &lt;djack&gt; i have a 300 second cycle on that template</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:23:18] &lt;djack&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:23:44] &lt;djack&gt; it a debug log so i only need to know how many errors there where ...</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:23:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; JROCK2004: yes you do</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:23:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; give me an example of what awk '$0&gt;=from&amp;&amp;$0&lt;=to' from="${BACK}" to="${NOW}" ${LOGFILE} would output</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:24:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think you're totally overcomplicating the function that you're piping it to</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:24:16] &lt;djack&gt; frs-query01 Fredhopper.log | cnt=0 error= warn=</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:24:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I need to see the output to be sure</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:24:21] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; twm1010: ok I just added them so I will give it a few and see if this works</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:24:45] &lt;djack&gt; then cnt is the amount of lines counted the error should be the errors and the warn should be warning</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:24:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; JROCK2004: its a useful graph, we used as an indicator when our websites were under DoS attacks last year</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:24:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; no no</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:25:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; not what the script outputs</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:25:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; when workers skyrocketed, we knew something was up</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:25:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; the output of doing awk '$0&gt;=from&amp;&amp;$0&lt;=to' from="${BACK}" to="${NOW}" ${LOGFILE}</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:25:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; (with the variables obviously set to something)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:25:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; I assume it outputs lines</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:26:11] &lt;djack&gt; it output the amount of lines that matches the criteria</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:26:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; mrayzenoss: Are there ever plans to build an auto-update feature?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:26:27] &lt;djack&gt; i've noticed that awk is lots faster then grep</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:26:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; It only outputs the amount of lines when you actually pipe it to | awk ' $3 ~ /ERROR/ {++e} ; END { print e }'</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:26:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I want you to execute the first part (before the pipe)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:27:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; and show me what the output would look like</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:27:26] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; When making thresholds for the max value should you always use this structure here.totalBlocks * .95</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:27:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: while that would be nice&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; it sounds painful to implement</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:27:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yay, </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3757.html">docs/DOC-3757</a></span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:27:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; sure, everyone is installed differently</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:28:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: that structure is only for values gathered by collector plugins</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:28:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: most thresholds are just a plain value</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:28:32] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; does any of the docs explain this?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:28:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm fairly sure the admin guide does</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:28:42] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; so I do not bother you guys</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:28:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you read it?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:28:50] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; parts of it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:28:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; mrayzenoss: very cool i'll be using that soon</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:28:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; Read the Zenoss Admin Guide top to bottom please</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:29:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; works under 2.5?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:29:09] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; Like I said before I want to sit down and read it.

When things get over my head I glaze over a bit. Then I realize that I put in about 10% effort, jump in, pester rmatte a little and things make sense.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:32:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm finding once you get into it things start to click a little quicker</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:32:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I powered through the whole admin guide in about a day and a half</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:32:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; some parts are a bit dry, but it's not bad</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:32:55] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; wow</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:33:06] &lt;djack&gt; rmatte </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/d5c439394">http://pastebin.com/d5c439394</a></span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:33:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; the dev guide is VERY dry</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:33:22] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; JROCK2004: the new beta Admin guide is available</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:33:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; djack: perfect, thanks...</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:33:46] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/zenoss/files/zenoss-2.5.beta/Zenoss_Administration_06-092009-250-01.pdf/download">https://sourceforge.net/projects/zenoss/files/zenoss-2.5.beta/Zenoss_Administration_06-092009-250-01.pdf/download</a></span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:33:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; djack: give me a minute to work with this...</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:33:55] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; so you at least have the latest</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:34:02] &lt;djack&gt; wc -l returns 0 when it does not have a match i guess awk should also have something to match that</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:35:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; ummm, that pastebin has no line wrapping</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:35:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; kind of useless</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:35:52] &lt;cgibbons&gt; so... matt, what don't we just release the latest RC as 2.5.0 and call it done?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:36:26] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; mrayzenoss1: Should I read that over the currecent one?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:36:35] &lt;djack&gt; i think i can do it with an if statement in the awk</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:36:49] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; dam I just printed the old one too</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:36:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; probably</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:37:00] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; JROCK2004: that's the latest, it'll be revved again when 2.5 officially comes out</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:37:14] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; but you might as well always read the latest</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:37:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; djack: does it actually output with no new lines like that?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:37:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; djack: kind of weird</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:37:28] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; unless you plan on staying on an older build</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:37:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; i anxious for 2.5, but am stuck on 2.4.x until egor updates :|</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:37:45] &lt;djack&gt; rmatte not when there are no erros in the error log</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:37:46] &lt;cgibbons&gt; is he even working on that yet?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:38:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: he said he's been really busy lately, so not sure, I let him know about it though</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:38:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; no idea, i dropped him a PM, mrayzenoss said he dropped him an e-mail, but thats a make it or break it for me so</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:38:10] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; I don't know.&#160; I've sent him several emails over the last couple of weeks with no responses</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:38:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; here i stay</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:38:31] &lt;cgibbons&gt; is it just the WMI Data Source one that won't work?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:38:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; well, yes, but lots of other templates have that as a dependency</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:38:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, since his other packs are basically just templates that use that pack</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:39:01] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; mrayzenoss1: I usually stay with the version I have once it goes stable. Is it predicted to go stable soon</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:39:01] &lt;cgibbons&gt; nod, it might be fast for me to convert it if he's busy</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:39:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; the data source pack totally breaks King Crab</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:39:08] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; cgibbons: I'd assume the WBEM one is broken too...</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:39:13] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; possibly ODBC</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:39:17] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:39:32] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; which I emailed him about the "pyodbc" dependency and never heard back</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:39:33] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; graphs are not being created for squid zenpack graphs</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:40:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; djack: no, I mean, in the pastebin the log entries aren't on different lines, they are all mashed together in to one line</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:41:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you're basically just counting the amount of times it says "ERROR"</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:41:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; rather than counting actual lines</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:42:30] &lt;twm1010&gt; cgibbons: That would go a long way I think.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:43:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; djack: why wouldn't you just set e to 0 right off the bat each time the command is run?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:43:20] &lt;twm1010&gt; Since this mostly mimics, albeit in a different way, the enterprise zenwinperf, why bother keeping that an enterprise only feature?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:43:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; djack: your problem is that the variable doesn't get set to anything if awk doesn't match anything</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:44:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; ERROR=`e=0 &amp;&amp; awk '$0&gt;=from&amp;&amp;$0&lt;=to' from="${BACK}" to="${NOW}" ${LOGFILE} | awk ' $3 ~ /ERROR/ {++e} ; END { print e }'`</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:44:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; that should work</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:45:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; (no if statement required)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:45:05] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; twm1010: with the busy and idle stuff if the green is higher than the blue then we have issues correct?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:46:07] &lt;twm1010&gt; Well I think it allocates workers dynamically, but there is a minimum</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:46:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; so once it reaches a certain amount, the blue will jump up too</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:47:20] &lt;twm1010&gt; I think maybe you would eventually just set a threshold to watch for it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:49:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm new Mac mini = itty bitty zenoss server? :D</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:50:43] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; especially the server version</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:50:48] mrayzenoss1 is now known as mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:51:17] &lt;twm1010&gt; Yeah, though, I think it is a touch overpriced</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:51:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; still, thats not bad at all</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:52:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; I wonder what the disk configuration of the drives is</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:52:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; RAID stripe/mirror? probably not</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:52:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; maybe software raid</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:56:13] &lt;rhettardo&gt; there are cheaper ways to make an itty bitty zenoss server</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:56:28] &lt;rhettardo&gt; i just bought a foxconn dualcore atom barebones box for 115</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:56:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah, shuttle bare bones case, linux, etc.</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:56:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; i've been meaning to do it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:56:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rhettardo: link?</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:57:26] &lt;rhettardo&gt;

119 sorry</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:57:54] &lt;rhettardo&gt; obviously not as powerful as the mini's but i cant really go wrong when i already had all the hardware lying around doing nothing</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:58:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hmm&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; still needs ram and drives</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:58:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; djack: did that work?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:59:26] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rhettardo: I run on a 10" Dell Mini</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:59:32] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; mrayzenoss: when you go to these trainings do you know if they give you a printed manual?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:59:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; JROCK2004: nope</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 15:59:47] &lt;zenethian&gt; I like how the combo deal is selling incompatible hardware.</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:00:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; JROCK2004: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../community/documentation/official_documentation/training.html">community/documentation/official_documentation/training</a></span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:00:20] &lt;rhettardo&gt; any way.&#160; for a while now it seems like the zenoss http server is taking forever to return requests when i try to view a device.&#160; im running 2.4.5 on centos 5.3 32bit.&#160; load on the box is pretty steady at .69 and cacti responds promptly.&#160; only an issue in zenoss right now</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:00:44] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; mrayzenoss: thanks I am excited to go</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:00:48] &lt;rhettardo&gt; mrayzenoss: yeah.&#160; still needs drives and ram.&#160; crappy part is you cant run a fullsize drive and a cdrom drive in it too</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:00:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; k, shutting things down here until tomorrow</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:01:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; ttyl</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:01:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I heard of someone using this for Zenoss: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.marvell.com/products/embedded_processors/developer/kirkwood/sheevaplug.jsp">http://www.marvell.com/products/embedded_processors/developer/kirkwood/sheevaplug.jsp</a></span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:01:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; $99 everything</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:01:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; only monitored 6 or 7 devices though</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:01:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I've seen the sheevaplug, interesting concept</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:01:45] &lt;rhettardo&gt; mrayzenoss: nice.&#160; i'd like a netbook.&#160; i still run an older 1.7ghz centrino crappy dell laptop</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:01:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you definitely wouldn't get a lot out of it lol</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:05:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, ziptie crashed on one of my servers</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:10:22] &lt;rhettardo&gt; so anyone have an idea why it takes an abnormal amount of time to navigate to a specific device for me?&#160; bringing up the device list page and settings page for example load up instantly</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:11:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; using LDAP?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:11:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; rhettardo: have the Cisco Mibs ZenPack installed per chance?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:12:08] &lt;rhettardo&gt; nope and nope</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:12:42] &lt;rhettardo&gt; its essentially a basic install except for the watchguard zenpack i created for myself</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:13:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:13:19] &lt;rhettardo&gt; i vaguely recall this starting after i upgraded from 2.3 but not certain :\</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:14:13] &lt;rhettardo&gt; everything else seem to be fine.&#160; its just annoying slow to pull stats</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:14:30] &lt;cgibbons&gt; that's a lot smaller than the little atom server i was using, matt</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:15:55] &lt;cgibbons&gt; doh! it's after 4 :_)</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:16:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; If I wanted a compact server I'd grab a soekris</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:16:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are the best</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:17:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are basically the size of a dsl modem</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:18:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; more expensive than my netbook though</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:18:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, they are quite pricy</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:18:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; but if I had the money for it, I'd grab one</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:18:30] &lt;kobalt&gt; how do I make sure its collecting the data point that I created... yes still working on this template thing</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:18:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; My home server is pretty nice though, 6.4GHz of processing power in it hehe</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:19:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; mhmmm, ziptie just magically started working, woot</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:21:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; sweet, I finally finished commissioning this client</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:21:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; got access to the last device that I needed access to</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:23:58] &lt;rhettardo&gt; i dont have a home server.&#160; i just grab all my stuff over the tunnel to the datacenter or office</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:28:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a home server for personal use</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:28:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; hosts my mail servers, name server, web server, irc server, etc...</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:29:07] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; rmatte: I give you credit. My mail server worked bu spam was a killer</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:29:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; I get a bit of spam right now but it's because I haven't tuned spam assassin much lately</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:29:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; spam assassin++</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:30:11] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; rmatte: let me ask this why would you want to run your own mail server? Were you just wanting to learn or is there other reasons?</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:30:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; JROCK2004: for fun</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:30:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus I have absolutely unlimited storage space for my mail</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:31:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:31:06] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; Gotcha. When I was at my old job the admins could not understand why I wanted to host my own mail server</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:31:13] &lt;JROCK2004&gt; I said to learn thats why</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:31:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:31:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I like having full control over my own email server as well</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:31:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not the only person who uses it, some of my friends and my parents use it</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:32:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually there's a permissions issue preventing me from using the admin interface to create accounts right now, I'll have to fix that, been putting it off</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:40:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: try adding a .1 then</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:41:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; oops</span><br/><span><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:53:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; looks like Kells rewrote most of zenmib.py </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5405">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5405</a></span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:53:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; lovely, I can just smell the bugs that will come from that rewrite</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:53:32] &lt;rhettardo&gt; man my uverse has been sucking since we got rains out here</span><br/><span> [20-Oct-2009 16:53:35] &lt;rmatte&gt;

thanks ray, I'll explore it</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:54:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; mrayzenoss: I was curious, with the community (Egor) using WMI datasource, why bother keeping zenwinperf enterprise only?</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:55:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: we're having that discussion</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:55:46] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i'm doing my best to wrangle product management into agreeing to that, too :) as is matt</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:56:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; I can see it being a bit of a hat in the cap, but we're going around it as it is.</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:56:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Egor's stuff is a bit different, but we're looking at merging and moving stuff into Core</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:56:14] &lt;cgibbons&gt; we'd really like to include Egor's WMI Datasource (I'm looking into that one) as a part of core, and then include zenwinperf as well. that'll let anyone use WMI-based or Perfmon-based data sources.</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:56:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: agreed</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:56:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; Yeah, cgibbons explain the difference one day</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:56:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; i suppose there are some things available via WMI that are not available as perfmon counters</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:56:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: the current plan is to move more Enterprise monitoring features into Core, it's just a matter of time</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:57:12] &lt;cgibbons&gt; usually it is the other way around, as far as metric data goes</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:57:26] &lt;cgibbons&gt; perfmon typically has much more. the WMI queries are usually grabbing perfmon counters internally on the server.</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:57:37] &lt;twm1010&gt; I see</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:57:41] &lt;cgibbons&gt; WMI has more configuration data of course.</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 09:58:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: there will be something new in 2.5 that was originally intended for Enterprise</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 10:01:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; Cool... not in the current RC I'd imagine.</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 10:02:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: I'm not supposed to spoil it for marketing...</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 10:02:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

erm, developer-guys :)</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:06:05] &lt;chudler&gt; lacking good advice, just do what feels good ;-)</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:08:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: really depends on which tab you feel it should show up in lol</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:10:10] &lt;rmatte&gt;

What I'm looking at is the fact that OSComponent uses ManagedEntity</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:11:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; perhaps that just means whether a component could be added via the GUI or not</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:12:52] &lt;davetoo&gt;

not yet sure what I have to have for performance data capture</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:26:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; I think 'snmpindex' is one :)</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:27:04] &lt;jb&gt;

or performance?</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:27:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; both,</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:27:27] &lt;jb&gt; you need snmpindex if you need to relate multiple snmp tables usually</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:27:37] &lt;jb&gt; otherwise, you probably wont need it, and can use your own index</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:28:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; I guess I'm trying to figure out what magic is required to make zenperfsnmp get the OIDs it needs; and how significant is the fact that OSComponents mix in ManagedEntitdy,</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:28:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; but HWComponent does not;</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:29:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; but I'm looking at the HardDisk component on one of my managed servers, and I have rrd data/graphs there</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:29:20] &lt;jb&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:29:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; seems a little mixed up</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:29:36] &lt;jb&gt; take a look at egor's hp/dell pack</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:29:39] &lt;jb&gt; or my ibm 3584 pack perhaps</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:29:56] &lt;jb&gt; you basically create a performance template with the index of the snmp tree you want</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:29:58] &lt;jb&gt; and zenoss does theh rest</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:30:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; well, as far as the infrastructure goes, for page templates and such,</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:31:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; What does OSComponent give me that HWComponent does not?</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:31:07] &lt;jb&gt; i use egor's devAdvDetail zenpack when I want to add new templates</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:31:12] &lt;jb&gt; sorry have to run to a meeting</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 11:31:13] &lt;jb&gt;

tripitaka: you can change the setting on the Event Manager "Delete Historical Events Older Than (days)"</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 15:46:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's 0 by default, meaning nothing gets deleted</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 15:46:35] &lt;tripitaka&gt;

you can also connect to the mysql db and look around to get a feel for what you want to drop</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 15:59:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, looking through a 35gig mysql db might be a bit tedious though :)</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:00:07] &lt;chemist&gt;

and keep the $500 prizes</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:12:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; perhaps $2k grand prize, 4x$500 prizes and t-shirts for entrants</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:14:55] &lt;rmatte&gt;

(or a windows box, if it tickles your fancy)</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:46:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; Because I have 120 people all over the globe modifying the same dataset, and need access control and auditing, and also some IP Address Management</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:47:08] &lt;rmatte&gt;

ah ok</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:51:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so post 2.5, they won't work at all</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:51:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or at least, if they don't work at all we won't fix them</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:52:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; was it jplouis that you said doesn't work there anymore?</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:52:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm doing an svn update from 2.2.4 to trunk; that should take an hour or so :)</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:52:26] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; nope, jplouis is very much still here</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:52:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok cool</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:52:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; in fact, we hired another jp as a backup</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:52:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha, awesome</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:52:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; we had 2 ryans and 2 brians here for a while</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:52:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; but one of the Brians (our old developer) quit a few weeks back</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:53:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; dev now has 2 Jean Pierre's and a John</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:53:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; There's usually a Redundant Array of Indepedent Daves wherever I work</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:53:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's not too bad, call one Jean, one John, and one Johnny</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:53:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:55:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; I had 5 mikes that I was supporting when I was a LAN Admin working for the canadian government</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:55:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; that was always fun</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:56:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; My last name being pronounced Matt usually confuses the heck out of people :P</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:56:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; "What's your first name!?"</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:57:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:58:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I used to have the office next to Ray Matthews</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:58:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; doesn't get more confusing than that</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:59:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:59:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; there is one guy in our Indian office</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 16:59:35] &lt;rmatte&gt;

His name is Justine Bridgettte</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 17:00:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; I think they pronounce it "Justin"</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 17:00:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; (only two 't')</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 17:03:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 17:05:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm revising my name, I shall no longer be Ryan Matte, I shall be Staff Sgt.

I still think you should put All Your Node are Belong to Us on a t-shrit</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 17:20:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; shirt</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 17:37:28] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; so since day 1 I've been having a problem with OSProcesses sending alerts that they are down when they're not...</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 18:17:14] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; usually they're for various java processes we're running</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 18:17:48] &lt;davetoo&gt;

any idea?</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 21:50:36] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 21:51:03] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; you check collector plugins?</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 22:42:01] &lt;salax&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [21-Oct-2009 22:42:41] &lt;salax&gt; cryptographrix,i used the collector plugins from the zenoss community</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 00:00:46] [disconnected at Thu Oct 22 00:00:46 2009]</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 00:00:46] [connected at Thu Oct 22 00:00:46 2009]</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 00:00:56] [zenoss-logger (logger bot) has joined #zenoss]</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 03:33:06] &lt;swarog&gt;

never mind, i got it from here </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3582.html">docs/DOC-3582</a></span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:27:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; morning</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:27:15] &lt;ro11e&gt; hello</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:28:14] &lt;ro11e&gt; does anyone know if it is possible to forward the "zenoss issues" portlet information to some other place with email, pager or equivalent?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:28:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; Zenoss issues is to show you problems with the Zenoss server... i.e. heartbeat failures</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:28:44] &lt;ro11e&gt; or what is the "best" way to make sure that monitoring is working as intended</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:28:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ro11e: I believe those issues are generated by some event</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:29:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ro11e: so if you can track down the event, you can get emails/pages/commands set with those particular ones</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:29:51] &lt;ro11e&gt; mrayzenoss: but for example if zenperfsnmp daemon stops for some reason</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:30:12] &lt;ro11e&gt; I haven't found any way to externally catch this</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:30:49] &lt;ro11e&gt; of course I could try to watch the process from zenoss through snmp, but if that particular process is stuck, it won&auml;t ever get a response :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:30:55] &lt;ro11e&gt; or am I way off here?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:31:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; no, let me see if I can recreate</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:31:29] &lt;swarog&gt; ro11e: why dont you just check all zenoss processes from crontab and some simple script?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:31:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; ro11e: any daemon stopping except for zenactions, produces a heartbeat event</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:31:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I've got a 10 minute meeting, BRB</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:31:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; Ya'll are losing me here, why can't he simply use an alerting rule?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:32:07] &lt;swarog&gt; twm1010: because the thing that should alert stopped?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:32:08] &lt;ro11e&gt; can I catch heartbeat events as well?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:32:30] &lt;swarog&gt; is the whole zenoss written in python?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:32:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; heartbeat events aren't generated by zenperfsnmp, i'm pretty sure</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:32:45] &lt;swarog&gt; its kinda resources hungry</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:32:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; As long as zenactions and zopectl are running, you should be able to alert on heartbeat failures</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:33:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; unless i'm missing something</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:33:24] &lt;ro11e&gt; no, I think we're on the same page here</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:33:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; swarog: I don't know about all of it, but a ton of it.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:34:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; well... since it is events, I suppose you need zenactions, MySQL, and zopectl</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:35:29] &lt;ro11e&gt; I've had some problems with zenperfsnmp and zenping getting very slow or stopping completely</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:36:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; do they create heartbeat failures?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:36:18] &lt;ro11e&gt; somewhere around 350 devices and one zenoss collector, I don't know if it is lot or not for single server to handle</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:36:27] &lt;ro11e&gt; yes, they create heartbeat failures</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:37:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm.. you might stand to do some tuning before you just create alerts to tell you about it having issues</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:37:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; You got adequate hardware?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:38:23] &lt;ro11e&gt; HP Proliant quadcore, 8GB memory</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:39:25] &lt;ro11e&gt; pretty new stuff, I would think that it could handle that load</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:39:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; Yep, but Zenoss daemons might not be configured to take advantage of all that hardware</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:39:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; There is a good daemon tuning guide to allow more worker processes and use more memory</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:40:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; mrayzenoss: do you have that link?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:40:14] &lt;ro11e&gt; installation is pretty much out of the box, except the DB</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:40:23] &lt;ro11e&gt; which has been tuned for more memory and cache</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:40:43] &lt;swarog&gt; now thats sounds a bit strange, quadcore and 8gb of ram not enough?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:40:52] &lt;swarog&gt; i would expect it to work with 2gb</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:40:55] &lt;swarog&gt; or 1gb</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:40:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; oh sure, it works</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:41:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; but when you scale the hardware up, you need to let zenoss know it can take advantage of it</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:41:37] &lt;ro11e&gt; yeah, if there is some good tuning guide, that would be really useful</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:41:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; there is one sec i'll find it</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:41:51] &lt;ro11e&gt; thx</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:42:39] &lt;swarog&gt; so, commercial version and community version differs in functionalities offered?</span><br/><span><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:43:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; here's a thread about tuning: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../message/20421.html#20421#20421">message/20421#20421</a></span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:43:53] &lt;ro11e&gt; swarog: as far as I know, commercial version has some extra zenpacks (plugins) and more fine-grained user access control</span><br/><span><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:44:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and here's that tweaking wiki entry: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2521.html">docs/DOC-2521</a></span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:45:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; swarog: currently Enterprise is targeted at larger installations, so built-in support for distributed collectors, ACLs, global dashboards and more monitoring options</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:45:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; most of that functionality is available in Core with some manual work</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:45:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and more of the monitoring is planned to move into Core</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:45:54] &lt;twm1010&gt; ro11e: Yes, that WIKI entry is it</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:46:08] &lt;ro11e&gt; ok, thanks</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:46:11] &lt;twm1010&gt; also, set your event console to show DEBUG, and you'll see all the OID's and such that its having trouble collecting. start tracking down things like this, and your collected events drops massively</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:46:22] &lt;swarog&gt; is it possible to rotate contact email on weekly basis?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:46:29] &lt;ro11e&gt; I am propably going to try to install several collectors in the near future to production</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:46:31] &lt;swarog&gt; alert email that is</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:47:01] &lt;ro11e&gt; We have made some tests, but one thing we were unsure about was that do the rrd files always stay locally on the collector?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:47:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; For me, it was creating the "interface" templates for things like T1 controllers and other random interface types that were causing OID lookup failures, once i created blank templates as placeholders, MySQL dropped WAY down and things started grooving.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:48:03] &lt;ro11e&gt; yes, we have also quite a lot of clutter coming in eg. through syslog interface</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:48:33] &lt;ro11e&gt; especially those nasty errors which are "off by one" every time and are added as individual events</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:48:36] &lt;ro11e&gt; and not added to counter</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:49:09] &lt;ro11e&gt; one time I hade to manually purge around 250k events from database and history, when couple of new installations got pretty wild...</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:50:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; might be a place to start... i ended up changing my few syslogging devices to *.warning</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:51:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; swarog: yes, look into Alert Schedules</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:52:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can assign them on the Administration tab under Locations/Systems/Groups</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:52:29] &lt;ro11e&gt; mrayzenoss: do you have any insight on the rrd files staying on the manually added collectors?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:52:47] &lt;ro11e&gt; or can the system be configured in such a way that rrd data is always on the hub?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:53:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ro11e: killing zenperfsnmp creates an /Status/Heartbeat event of Error severity</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:53:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ro11e: you can create alert rules for /Status/Heartbeat events</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:53:19] &lt;ro11e&gt; ok</span><br/><span><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:53:24] &lt;swarog&gt; question about pricing, </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/product/pricing">http://www.zenoss.com/product/pricing</a></span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:53:37] &lt;swarog&gt; this "Silver" thing, is 100$ per monitored resource?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:53:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ro11e: I don't have any experience with manually adding collectors in Core.&#160; I can point you to the community write-ups, but I haven't done it</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:54:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; swarog: yeah, but it's negotiable</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:54:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; especially if you have any sort of volume</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:54:44] &lt;swarog&gt; so, say i have 300 servers and 300 network pieces of equipment</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:54:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm not in Sales :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:55:01] &lt;swarog&gt; i can count on like 30k$/year?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:55:19] &lt;etank&gt; how can i use a TALES expression in zLinks?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:55:20] &lt;swarog&gt; just asking ... i need some figures for management, rough</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:55:32] &lt;etank&gt; i am trying something like this</span><br/><span><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:55:34] &lt;etank&gt;

swarog: It's a hard sell to management.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:55:43] &lt;ro11e&gt; mrayzenoss: how about in enterprise, do the rrd files stay at collectors or do they come to hub?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:55:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; sw</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:55:49] &lt;etank&gt; but in the links area on the status page it just says 'device'</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:56:00] &lt;etank&gt; instead of the hyperlink</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:56:04] &lt;ro11e&gt; reason I ask because at hub we have possibility to use very fast SAN disks</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:56:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ro11e: there are multiple hubs, they stay with them</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:56:11] &lt;ro11e&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:56:37] &lt;ro11e&gt; is it even possible to install multiple hubs with core? has anyone done this?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:56:42] &lt;etank&gt; if i static the ip then it works fine</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:56:56] &lt;etank&gt; looking for something more dynamic / generic though</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:57:16] &lt;twm1010&gt; ro11e: I've thought about it, but with core, its just as easy to setup a second server</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:57:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; why bother just collecting data, when you can just have a second server... you could even have the two servers monitor each other</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:57:57] &lt;twm1010&gt; sure, its more to maintain, but ah... the flexibility.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:58:19] &lt;ro11e&gt; we have manually built some scripts to another server which monitors zenoss alerting chain</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:58:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm trying now to see if they'll let me put a zenoss server at our e-commerce hosting facility.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:58:26] &lt;ro11e&gt; it sends and receives SMS messages</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:58:40] &lt;ro11e&gt; which is pirmary function to alert on-call staff</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:59:01] &lt;ro11e&gt; but I think that in the future we are trying to do something more high end</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:59:44] &lt;ro11e&gt; we already have three identical rack servers, so we have the hardware</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 08:59:51] &lt;ro11e&gt; just need the time and the resources :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:00:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; But all for only 350 devices?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:00:15] &lt;twm1010&gt; I think you could do that with one, I am.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:00:35] &lt;twm1010&gt; i mean, unless each device is a 256 port switch right?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:00:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:00:47] &lt;ro11e&gt; yes, performance-wise</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:01:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; my need for more collectors was to have different polling times</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:01:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; our SolarWinds server lets us set polling for every node individually, and then by interface if we want.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:01:19] &lt;ro11e&gt; we have sites in different continents</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:01:23] &lt;ro11e&gt; and different networks</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:01:47] &lt;ro11e&gt; and the idea is that if network to for example China drops, we won't get flooded</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:02:02] &lt;ro11e&gt; and trust me, it drops :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:02:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; you might want to talk to rmatte at some point i think he's monitoring a lot of networks, but he uses multiple servers, not distributed collection</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:02:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; BRB, swithcing networks</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:04:00] &lt;ro11e&gt; hmm, I have been so stuck on thinkin about adding collectors, that adding multiple hubs (or servers) hasn't even come to my mind</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:04:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; the only pain really, is that its more work, you change something here, you gotta change it there</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:04:41] &lt;ro11e&gt; we have the possibility to have a server installed on every site in VMWare (RHEL or CentOS) which would have the collector installed</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:05:16] &lt;Dr_Agon&gt; hi all</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:05:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; hello</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:07:30] &lt;Dr_Agon&gt; can anybody help me with little code modifications to Products? :) Actually i have WebServerAuth installed on my Zenoss and i want to patch it to provide new login_form.pt</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:08:26] &lt;Dr_Agon&gt; how can i create new subdir in zport/portal_skins ?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:09:53] &lt;Dr_Agon&gt; i've looked for example code in ZenWidgets where they using skinstool = getToolByName(self, 'portal_skins')</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:10:42] &lt;Dr_Agon&gt; what i can get instead of self instance in WebServerAuth/__init__py</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:10:47] &lt;Dr_Agon&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:10:50] &lt;Dr_Agon&gt; =)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:11:07] &lt;Dr_Agon&gt; or where else can i ask for help&amp;</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:11:08] &lt;Dr_Agon&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:11:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; Try the development forum on the community website</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:16:00] &lt;etank&gt; argh this TALES stuff in zLinks</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:16:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Dr_Agon: yeah, the zenoss-dev forum, and every other week there's a developer scheduled to be here</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:17:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; sometimes they lurk, but they may be unreliable</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:18:31] &lt;Dr_Agon&gt; thnx - i'll try zenoss-dev then.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:24:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah... productive morning, my blackberry now recieves zenoss messages as "level 1" and plays the sound of daffy duck screaming when they arrive.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:26:44] &lt;ro11e&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:33:43] &lt;ckrough&gt; twm1010: whats this about the BB now</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:34:01] &lt;ckrough&gt; twm1010: I would love to break my zenoss alerts out from my other sms messages</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:39:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; i just did a filter</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:40:16] &lt;twm1010&gt; but, if you're using BIS you can create a blackberry only e-mail address too</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:41:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; but it is nice to see those alerts come up in red and play some wacky sound that you can't mistake from a normal message</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:43:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; of course, mine aren't SMS messages, they are e-mails</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:46:52] &lt;ckrough&gt; where do you create the filter</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 09:47:06] &lt;ckrough&gt; ah, nm...

ok cool</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 11:55:51] &lt;AGP&gt; now it's a 1.4mb file without -d99</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 11:56:25] &lt;cgibbons&gt; okay, that's the wmic with the win32_ntlogevent, so presumably it was able to get data then (if it can't we don't need to see the details)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 11:57:07] &lt;AGP&gt; indeed, it list out lots of event similiar to the event log</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 11:57:22] &lt;jb&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 11:57:25] &lt;cgibbons&gt; okay, interesting, and yet zeneventlog couldn't even get a response hmmmm</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 11:57:30] &lt;jb&gt; another enterprise zenpack thats in core now?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 11:57:31] &lt;jb&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 11:58:08] &lt;AGP&gt; just in case, the password only have letters and number</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 11:58:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; that just means that zenoss has to keep cranking out even cooler and cooler enterprise features</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:00:15] * aclark waves</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:00:28] &lt;cgibbons&gt; AGP: in $Products/ZenHome/ZenWin/Watcher.py, at line 42, can you change the line to (if that line is a log.debug): log.debug("connecting to %s [%s]", self.device.id, self.device.manageIp)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:00:43] &lt;cgibbons&gt; and then rerun zeneventlog for that device with a -v10</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:00:56] &lt;AGP&gt; sec</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:00:57] &lt;kobalt&gt; anyone install the beta on solaris 10 yet?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:03:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobalt: only if they're doing it from source.&#160; I'd love to see good Solaris source instructions</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:04:06] &lt;AGP&gt; cgibbons got this where it suppose to give ManageIp: ERROR:zen.zeneventlog:Exception getting windows events: DeviceProxy instance has no attribute 'ManageIp'</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:04:11] &lt;twm1010&gt; moving enterprise features to core is a double-edged sword</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:04:29] &lt;AGP&gt; wait a sec</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:04:30] &lt;AGP&gt; my bad</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:07:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I love how my zenprocess cycle interval is clearly set to 300 but I get threshold alerts like: threshold of zenprocess cycle time exceeded: current value 241.30</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:07:45] &lt;cgibbons&gt; ugh</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:07:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; it does that all the time</span><br/><span><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:08:06] &lt;AGP&gt; cgibbons here: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/d54df4112">http://pastebin.com/d54df4112</a></span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:08:34] &lt;AGP&gt; wait a minute</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:08:39] &lt;AGP&gt; some how it works now</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:08:44] &lt;cgibbons&gt; hrm</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:09:05] &lt;AGP&gt; i got a message from another admin</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:09:12] &lt;AGP&gt; he was fixing the dns server</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:09:18] &lt;AGP&gt; ffs -.-</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:09:45] &lt;AGP&gt; the information is coming in now</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:09:49] &lt;cgibbons&gt; shew</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:10:04] &lt;AGP&gt; no more zeneventlog in the events</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:10:14] &lt;AGP&gt; only zenperfwmi but that's another story :D</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:12:21] &lt;AGP&gt; thanks a lot cgibbons</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:12:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; All that troubleshooting and it was a DNS issue?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:12:33] &lt;AGP&gt; still dont really know why</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:12:35] &lt;AGP&gt; not really</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:12:41] &lt;AGP&gt; it take me half a day to figure out why</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:12:49] &lt;AGP&gt; the dns just down in 30 min</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:13:30] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yeah that is weird, since Zenoss does an initial host name lookpu when it creates the device and stashes it in the manageIp attribute which it should then use for connecting directly. But the timeout we were seeing was coming from a NetBIOS broadcast so it didn't have something it wanted...</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:13:30] &lt;AGP&gt; i can do all the wmic thing before i went home, the dns working just fine then</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:13:32] &lt;kobalt&gt; mrayzenoss: Im downloading the source now, going to see if I can get it to work</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:14:30] &lt;AGP&gt; anyway, one down, 4 windows server to go :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:14:36] &lt;AGP&gt; thanks again cgibbons</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:14:43] &lt;AGP&gt; if you come to vietnam sometime i will buy you a drink :D</span><br/><span><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:16:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobalt: there may be useful info here: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../community/developers/porting_&amp;_platforms.html">community/developers/porting_%26_platforms</a></span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:16:26] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobalt: someone had an OpenSolaris writeup that they took down, but I imagine the FreeBSD instructions may be useful</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:17:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobalt: and keep me posted on your blockers, because I run from source on a couple of boxes</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:17:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; lunchtime</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:22:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; whatever happened to the little "&lt; 30" or whatever the threshold was set to next to threshold names in graphs?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:23:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; used to be like "CPU &lt; 90", which was actually useful, now it's just "CPU"</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:23:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if the graph doesn't climb high enough you can't tell what the thresholds are set to at a glance</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:29:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, is that a 2.5 thing?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:30:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; is what?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:30:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; what I just described?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:30:18] &lt;twm1010&gt; the threshold legend you just typed about</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:30:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, that's a Zenoss 2.3.3 thing</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:30:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it magically dissapeared between 2.3.3 and 2.4.1</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:30:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; To be honest I hadn't noticed, maybe the format of the legend changed for thresholds</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:31:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; possibly, I have no way of checking that though</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:31:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd love to be able to set it back to how it was</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:31:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; because it was pure awesomeness</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:32:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; One of these days I'm going to punish all these people listening to Internet radio killing our bandwidth...</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:32:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:32:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; block the ports :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:32:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; or the sites</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:32:30] &lt;ckrough&gt; or flash</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:32:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt anyone really has a need to visit radioone.com or whatever</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:32:43] &lt;ckrough&gt; flash is the best and worst thing to happen to my intarwebs</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:32:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; so just BL all the sites</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:32:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; if only my packeteer had the shaper license, i could throttle by content</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:32:59] * ckrough goes back to FIDOnet</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:33:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; I could actually say... Pandora, Myspace, flash audio/video, 32k/sec max</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:33:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:33:16] &lt;twm1010&gt; alas, I only have analysis</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:33:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; packet shaping is fun fun</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:33:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah, we use it on the WAN quite a bit</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:34:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; then again, one of our linux utility servers has a squid proxy running i can pipe through</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 12:35:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:06:35] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; so for some reason, I'm getting a value or 12.06M for a performance monitor I created</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:07:29] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; I deleted the old rrd file, the monitor returns a cacti-formatted line and the data source is set to cacti parser...hmmm</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:08:14] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; but for some reason, last_update from rrdtool shows 1256234705, and ds[ds0].last_ds = "43" which is correct</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:09:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: hunh?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:09:17] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; yeah it's weird</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:09:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: the "M" is because of the default formatting for the graphpoint</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:09:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; if that's what you're complaining about</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:10:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to go in to the template, click on the graph, click on the graph point</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:10:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; and change format from %5.2lf%s to %5.2lf</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:10:56] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; yeah - I guess I'm trying to figure out why it's showing a value of 12.something instead of 44, which is correct and represented as last_ds in the rrd file</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:11:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; because it's auto-converting it due to the $s</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:11:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; erm, %s</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:11:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you want the exact value being given by SNMP then you need to remove the %s</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:11:57] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; ahkk</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:12:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; %5.2lf means..... 5 places to the left, and two places to the right of the decimal point</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:12:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; you can manipulate it to round things up/down :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:12:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; well, up, based on decimal places at least</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:13:05] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; hmmm...but now it's showing 12063616.79 for current value in graph...</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:13:25] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; actual value returned by the monitor is 44, and is shown as 44 in last_ds in the rrd file</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:14:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; what type is the datapoint, counter, gauge, derive?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:14:12] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: catching up with an earlier conversation&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; you can change the legend for the graphs for thresholds in the Graph Point</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:14:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you probably have the wrong datapoint type</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:14:51] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; it's set as gauge</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:15:06] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; what's the diff between the datapoints?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:15:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; gauge just records the current value</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:15:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: ok, that's not really what I was getting at, it used to dynamically show the value of the threshold after the name in the legend</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:15:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: now it doesn't</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:16:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; derive takes the delta between the last and current values, used for anything that is a "total" type counter</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:16:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; counter is... a counter :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:16:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: hmmm... dunno</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:16:31] &lt;cgibbons&gt; hurm</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:16:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: but it magically dissapeared between 2.3.3 and 2.4.x</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:16:50] &lt;twm1010&gt;&#160; did you maybe set it to "absolute" ?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:17:18] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; well it's set as gauge so I have no clue why it's getting 1256235005 for it...</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:17:25] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; nah, it's set to gauge</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:18:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; cryptographrix: kill the RRD and try again I guess</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:19:04] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; coolcool, yep</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:22:59] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; ty for datapoint type explanation two1010</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:23:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; probably got created as one type, and continued to be so aftewards</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:23:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; I think everything starts as gauge type</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:23:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:23:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; it does</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:23:59] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; I'm going to guess that, at sme point, I may have set it to either counter or derive and having changed it back to gauge at some point because I didn't know the datapoint types</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:24:10] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; either way, I'll find out in 3 cycles</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:24:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:56:20] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; so I have to present zenoss to the rest of the tech team - anything super unique about zenoss that I should point out that I might not have learned or thought of yet?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 13:59:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; show them how easy it would be to monitor a 10,000 node server farm</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:01:03] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; once we got a hadoop cluster up :p</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:01:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; cryptographrix: if you write a Hadoop ZenPack, that'll be eligible in the ZenPack contest launching Monday</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:05:22] &lt;ckrough&gt; cryptographrix: autodiscovery + modelling and the ability to monitor *anything* you can think of</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:05:36] &lt;ckrough&gt; given enough coffee and python</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:07:53] &lt;zenethian&gt; you can do anything.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:12:32] &lt;cgibbons&gt; you an do anything AND we have cool swag</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:13:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; aclark: just saw your tweet about the buildout&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; passed the word on to our build engineer.&#160; He's pretty busy getting 2.5 out, but he'll be looking at your buildout soon</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:15:18] &lt;aclark&gt; mrayzenoss: right, ian you mean? been talking to him</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:15:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Ian's one of the developers, we have a build engineer as well</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:15:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; he and Ian will be handling the move to buildout</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:15:46] &lt;aclark&gt; mrayzenoss: Ah, cool</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:15:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Ian's done the Python 2.6/Zope 2.12 work so far</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:16:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; but we're going to move to a buildout</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:16:20] &lt;aclark&gt; mrayzenoss: excellent</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:16:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and I'll be roping in the folks to help push Zenoss into distros</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:16:30] &lt;aclark&gt; cooool</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:23:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; gotta run, be back in an hour</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:32:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, the synthetic transaction that I had setup and working fine earlier suddenly just stopped working</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:32:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; grrr</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:33:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; seems to be working though, weird</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:33:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; SYNTHETIC TRANSACTION SUCCESSFUL|time=4.94;;;0.00</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:35:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; getting nan values on the time graph though</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:45:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; there, now it's working again</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:45:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll have to keep an eye on it</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:49:45] &lt;cgibbons&gt; geesh I think I could write blog entries on developing with Zenoss as a full-time job. there is so much to talk about.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:49:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:50:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:50:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; So if I were to choose/need to develop a new subclass of Device or OSComponent (or HWComponent)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:50:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; how can I add instances of that new class</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:51:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; to an organizer or device, without modifying the code in the core zenoss classes</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:51:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; i.e. where the current manage_addFoo defs are</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:51:37] &lt;davetoo&gt; and the relations</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:52:47] &lt;cgibbons&gt; PrinterToner does that, if you want an example, but let's say you created a FooBar Device, in your new Device Class you'd set the targetPythonClass property to be that python object and that'll do it</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:53:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; What about the addDevice dialogs</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:54:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'll look at that pack</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:54:14] &lt;cgibbons&gt; it's just a matter of picking that Device Class that you're adding (i.e. /Server/MyFooBarClass)?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:54:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh, I see</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:54:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; zPythonClass</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:54:45] &lt;cgibbons&gt; and the big limitation there is a device can't be two things at once... so if a device is a PrinterTonerDevice it can't also be a FooBarDevice</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:55:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; right;</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:55:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; The bigger question for me is actually how to add new HW or OS component types</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:55:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; but I thought I could have more control by creating a new Device type</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:56:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; where I could then add new relations</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:57:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; but thinking about it, I'd really kind of need to subclass DeviceHW or</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 14:57:24] &lt;cgibbons&gt; PrinterToner does that, too. It adds a new component, but since it is a new kind of component (not just another one of the existing ones), the PrinterTonerDevice gets created and a new relationship is defined in the two objects so that they can be linked. Then it'll show up where it needs to show up because the view properties of the device &amp; component are also updated.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:00:04] &lt;davetoo&gt; I want to create a new class, Sensor, which will have a Boolean and a Continuous (gauge?) subclass, and the gauge subclass will have attributes for thresholds set in the device itself.&#160; The idea is that as I model a Cisco device, the graph thresholds are set dynamically to the actual thresholds configured in the hardware</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:00:11] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; hey guys - how do I set location for google map?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:00:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; so I don't have to guess</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:00:43] &lt;cryptographrix&gt; location path?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:00:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; So a typical heirarchy would be something like&#160;&#160; Sensor-&gt;Gauge-&gt;Voltage or Sensor-&gt;Gauge-&gt;Temperatur</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:00:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; e</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:01:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; anyway I will spend some time looking at PrinterToner</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:02:14] &lt;jb&gt; look at the AIX SNMP pack too</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:02:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:02:29] &lt;cgibbons&gt; both good ones, nice &amp; to the point</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:02:42] &lt;cgibbons&gt; this is a way too hard thing to do unfortunately</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:02:47] &lt;jb&gt; the AIX SNMP pack will give you an example of how to establish new classes and relations</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:02:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; I've been drawing out a class heirarchy in UML in Visio :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:02:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok,</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:03:14] &lt;jb&gt; my IBM 3584 zenpack shows you how to establish new relations as well</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:03:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; I had a feeling that there must be some way to do it other than monkeying with the original class code</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:03:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; in fact seems to me that having the component types defined the way they are now is kind of a mistake</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:03:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; bad dependencies/coupling</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:05:08] &lt;cgibbons&gt; unfortunately the system is tightly coupled so you have a lot of things like that.</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:05:41] &lt;davetoo&gt; Which is why I ask the experts like you guys for your workarounds :)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:07:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; jb: where is your 3584 zenpack?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:08:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; I see it</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:28:19] &lt;jrock2004&gt; Anyone have a good site to read about the apache slots</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:41:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:42:04] &lt;davetoo&gt; I have a couple of OSF1 servers to monitor</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:47:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, think I need to turn up the command timeout value in zProperties for this synthetic transaction script to work properly...</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:56:27] &lt;cgibbons&gt; osf/1 ?!</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:57:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; osf/1 is Tru64 back when DEC owned it</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:57:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; old-school to da max</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:58:23] * aclark .oO(Digital DecStations running Ultrix&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;)</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 15:58:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span><span> [22-Oct-2009 16:00:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; somebody say Tru64? </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3464.html">docs/DOC-3464</a></span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 16:03:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; that may work with osf/1 but it's a long shot</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 16:06:47] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yeah i did a lot of work with the whole osf/1 / digital unix / tru-64 saga... sadly</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 17:04:49] &lt;cgibbons&gt; shew finally</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 17:11:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes, was I about OSF/1</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 21:25:06] &lt;salax&gt; hi all</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 21:43:07] &lt;salax&gt; hi, how do i disable auto discovery for zenoss?</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 21:43:23] &lt;salax&gt; it seems it detected and log all of the ips that i dont want</span><br/><span> [22-Oct-2009 21:43:31] &lt;salax&gt; how to turn it of?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 00:00:46] [disconnected at Fri Oct 23 00:00:46 2009]</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 00:00:46] [connected at Fri Oct 23 00:00:46 2009]</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 00:00:56] [zenoss-logger (logger bot) has joined #zenoss]</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 05:12:02] &lt;MorkBork&gt;

good morning folks</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:20:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; morning</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:21:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, this synthetic transaction pack is working out quite nicely, the site that I setup the transaction for last night failed and an alert was sent to the client</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:21:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; Very nice.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:21:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've sent Sonny a bunch of possible improvements (mostly cosmetic)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:21:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well, it's in SVN if you want to make them</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:21:37] &lt;twm1010&gt; We do alot of that using alertsite, so unti someone tells me to duplicate the effort I won't</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:21:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; like changing the names of the thresholds to "Response Time - Warning" and "Response Time - Critical" instead of just Warning and Critical</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:22:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: meh, I'd rather leave it up to the pack maintainer lol</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:22:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; Ubuntu 9.1 just around the corner :D</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:25:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; hunh/</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:25:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; Ubuntu 9.4 has been out forever</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:25:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; or not</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:25:41] * rmatte scratches his head</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:25:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; 9.04</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:25:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I think that's 9.10</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:26:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh right, 9.04</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:26:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; my bad</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:26:05] &lt;zenethian&gt; thinking of 9.04 maybe?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:26:25] &lt;zenethian&gt; I wonder if 9.10 will really add anything</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:26:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the difference between 8 and 9 was night and day</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:26:46] &lt;zenethian&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:26:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; 9 is a billion times less buggy</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:26:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; and looks a lot nicer too</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:27:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; (well, the default theme that is)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:28:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm looking at a youtube video of it and it really doesn't look any different than 9.04</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:28:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; most of the changes are probably on the backend</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:29:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; I think Ext4 as default might be the big thing.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:29:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; though people who have never seen it before are all "OMFG$%!$%^$@ AWESOME EFFECTS!&#160; A FRICKIN' CUBE!!!!!" then you tell them that that's been around for like 4-5 years...</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:30:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but I've heard good and bad things about Ext4</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:30:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure how quickly I want to jump to using it</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:30:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; looks like a new package management front-end</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:30:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; especially since ext3 is rock solid anyways</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:30:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; meh, I generally do package management from CLI anyways</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:31:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; apt-get FTW</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:31:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; I really want to use it, but i have an iMac at home, and to be honest I'm quite happy.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:31:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; I doubt I'll even go to OSX 10.6 anytime soon.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:31:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I tried to get my dad using Linux but he couldn't understand why he was no longer able to download random .EXEs from whatever sites and install a bunch of crap on the computer</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:31:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I showed him the package manager, but he didn't like having to use it</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:32:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; "What if I want to install this piece of spyware infested crap, I won't be able to do that!?"</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:33:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; People's preferences are so all over now, that I think the only correct answer is "use the one you like"</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:34:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:34:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; I loathe Apple's lag in proprietary overpriced hardware, but the OS is very nice.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:35:00] &lt;suprsonic&gt; is it possible to supress certain traps from being reported on in zenoss?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:35:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: to be fair, their hardware isn't all that overpriced, it's really good quality stuff, generally cutting edge as well</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:35:32] &lt;twm1010&gt; suprsonic: yes, if you classify the trap and set it's zproperty to drop, the event won't be created.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:35:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: the issue is that all they sell is high end stuff, they don't have any lower end products available, such as an apple netbook or something</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:35:44] &lt;suprsonic&gt; sweet</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:35:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte:&#160; some of it :)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:35:47] &lt;suprsonic&gt; thanks twm1010!</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:36:07] &lt;twm1010&gt; I do wish there was a mid-range desktop</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:36:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; the Mac Pros being servers-in-disguise</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:36:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; If they had an apple netbook for like 4 or 5 hundred bucks I'd pick one up in a second</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:37:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; Though, I will agree, there seems to be a higher quality control on the componenets</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:37:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; The new mac pros are going to have a 6 core processor in them</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:37:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; 6 %$%^&amp;^ cores!</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:37:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; (Although I still believe that cell processing is the thing of the future, I'm just waiting to see when they smarten up and start using them in actual desktop machines)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:37:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; they perform great in the PS3</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:38:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; PS3 is basically just a cheap supercomputer</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:38:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:38:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; Sure</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:40:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; some companies and agencies went out and bought a whole bunch of PS3s, threw Linux on them, clustered them, and voila, a supercomputer</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:40:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; it was cheaper than doing it with actual business grade servers</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:40:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; how much cheaper, I wonder</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:40:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; quite a bit apparently</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:40:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; and that was at the PS3s old higher price</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:40:57] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm actually a little miffed lately, as powerful as our servers are, there seems to be a push from management to compartmentalize our systems but at the same time reduce servers</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:41:04] &lt;suprsonic&gt; where would I set the community for zentrap?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:41:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; suprsonic: on the device that's sending the trap, not in zenoss</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:41:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; basically, they tell us, you can't mix an e-mail server and a file server</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:41:56] &lt;suprsonic&gt; so does zentrap accept any community?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:42:07] &lt;twm1010&gt; i'm fuzzy on that lately.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:42:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: it accepts the community set for collecting data globally I believe</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:42:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; zSnmpCommunity</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:42:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I'm not 100% on whether it actually needs to be sent with the correct string or not</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:43:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; been meaning to ask cgibbons about that</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:43:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was under the impression that it did need to have the correct string</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:43:55] &lt;suprsonic&gt; rmatte is that on the device?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:45:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; I believe zentrap will accept any community, honestly.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:45:22] &lt;suprsonic&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:45:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; That may be true, but it really shouldn't lol</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:45:37] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm not using "public" on any zproperty anywhere, yet some devices traps are making it there.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:45:38] &lt;suprsonic&gt; cause I've been struggling on getting traps to show up on a device registered in zenoss</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:45:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; Might be worth getting an answer to then.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:46:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: you're sure you've configured the traps to be sent to the correct IP and that there's no firewall blocking the traffic?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:46:15] &lt;suprsonic&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:46:23] &lt;suprsonic&gt; and I see them coming in via tcpdump on zenoss server</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:47:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; wow, from an old IRC chat, involving me</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:48:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; cluther: There isn't a configuration knob for accepted community strings. It just accepts everything.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:50:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:50:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; guess that answers it (didn't know)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:50:17] &lt;twm1010&gt; LOL</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:50:20] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm the one who asked for it</span><br/><span><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:50:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; cell processors look so badass: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://news.spong.com/asset/228179/11/11413/entity">http://news.spong.com/asset/228179/11/11413/entity</a></span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:51:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, time to do some expect scripting</span><br/><span><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:51:11] &lt;twm1010&gt; check it </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/2565">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/2565</a></span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:51:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; Recommended by twm1010 on the #zenoss IRC channel.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:51:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:51:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; Opened 22 months ago</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:51:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; long time</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:52:48] &lt;twm1010&gt; So then, it should take anything. I'll test that out later.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:53:13] &lt;suprsonic&gt; looks like zenoss creates two processes or traps</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:53:16] &lt;suprsonic&gt; is that right?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:53:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; you mean like 2 zentrap threads?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:53:56] &lt;suprsonic&gt; possible</span><br/><span><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:54:02] &lt;suprsonic&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/d7d876505">http://pastebin.com/d7d876505</a></span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:54:14] &lt;suprsonic&gt; looks like it</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:59:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; it runs a few thresded processes</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 10:59:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; threaded*</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:06:32] &lt;suprsonic&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:06:35] &lt;suprsonic&gt; and its listening</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:06:43] &lt;suprsonic&gt; but not registering any traps that I send it</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:06:49] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I'm sending a cold start trap</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:07:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; do a tcpdump</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:07:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; see if the traffic is at least coming through</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:07:39] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I've confirmed that</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:07:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you tried just restarting zenoss then trying again?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:08:04] &lt;suprsonic&gt; heheh done that too</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:08:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; You're running Zenoss on Linux I assume?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:08:28] &lt;suprsonic&gt; FreeBSD</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:08:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, I kind of got the feeling of that from "sockstat"</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:08:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:08:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; FreeBSD + Zenoss == Uber Quirky</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:09:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; either way, I doubt this is a problem with Zenoss itself, as long as zentrap is running it has to be something else</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:09:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; you running a firewall on that box?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:09:39] &lt;suprsonic&gt; nope</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:09:40] &lt;suprsonic&gt; disabled</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:10:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, not sure, doesn't sound like anything should be wrong then, I haven't installed or managed Zenoss on FreeBSD, so I don't know of any common issues associated with it</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:11:23] &lt;suprsonic&gt; maybe I'll try ubuntu</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:11:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just know that almost everyone I've seen try to use Zenoss on FreeBSD run in to weird issues</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:14:19] &lt;salax&gt; it is easier for me to use ubuntu server with zenoss</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:14:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; Ubuntu is what we use for our Zenoss servers and it works perfect</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:16:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; Ubuntu, and install Zenoss using the stack installer</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:17:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; much easier, and guaranteed to work properly</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:20:28] * davetoo yawns</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:22:48] &lt;suprsonic&gt; everything else works</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:22:52] &lt;suprsonic&gt; just curious that its just traps</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:25:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, syslog is working?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:25:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're looking at incoming versus outgoing</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:26:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's possible that you're somehow running something else on the trap port</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:26:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; FreeBSD's inetd suite is a pain in the ass</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:26:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; (one of the reasons why I never install it)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:27:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; lsof is your friend :)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:27:19] &lt;suprsonic&gt; you'd be the first</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:27:28] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I think its crazy simple inetd</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:29:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's crazy simple in the sense that it runs all sorts of crap by default unless you comment it out in the config</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:29:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, some of it's stuff, such as it's ftp server, are not as secure as some that you can download</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:29:25] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I think you and I are talking about something different</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:29:38] &lt;suprsonic&gt; cause default FreeBSD has nothing turned on but syslogd</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:29:46] &lt;suprsonic&gt; and inetd everything is disabled by default.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:29:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; probably, I'm talking about FreeBSDs suite of net related daemons that are enabled by default</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:30:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, that must be relatively new, I remember having to comment out the lines in the config manually</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:30:41] &lt;suprsonic&gt; must have been years ago, cause its nothing like you're discribing.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:30:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; I haven't used FreeBSD in like 4 years</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:31:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; The first time I used it was like 10 years ago</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:31:44] &lt;suprsonic&gt; its my prefered platform</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:32:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; It used to be for me, but after working with Linux for a while I really started preferring it to FreeBSD</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:33:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; better support, better compatibility, and compiling everything from source all the time gets old after a while</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:33:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; (I switched to Gentoo after FreeBSD but eventually switched to Ubuntu because compiling everything was overly time consuming)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:34:03] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I wonder if net-snmp sends traps via tcp now rather than udp and that's why its not registering?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:34:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; I don't think so</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:34:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: shouldn't make a difference</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:34:44] &lt;suprsonic&gt; rmatte trap only listening on udp</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:34:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; there's a new trap-like thing called snmp "inform"</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:35:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but I doubt that it's sending in tcp</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:35:33] &lt;davetoo&gt; no, I think it's still udp with app-level 3-way</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:35:54] &lt;suprsonic&gt; yeah, its sending via UDP</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:35:56] &lt;suprsonic&gt; darn</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:36:32] &lt;davetoo&gt; Wonder if zenoss can handle informs</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:36:52] &lt;suprsonic&gt; its just a simple cold start trap</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:37:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: I would recommend just using Ubuntu or CentOS or whatever to run Zenoss on, you won't run in to as many stupid problems like this and you won't have issues when upgrading between versions of Zenoss (I've heard horror stories)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:37:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: any particular reason why you insist on FreeBSD (other than a sense of personal loyalty to it)?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:39:01] &lt;suprsonic&gt; you're not going to like my answer</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:39:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:39:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; try me</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:39:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:39:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:39:26] &lt;suprsonic&gt; tiny install base and extremely fast</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:40:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; mhmmm, I highly doubt that it's really got much of an edge performancewise over Linux.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:40:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I used to be a FreeBSD fanboy, and that's just fanboy talk lol</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:40:13] &lt;suprsonic&gt; you'd be suprised</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:40:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; anyways, I need to head out to lunch, I shall return shortly.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:40:28] &lt;suprsonic&gt; also, I'm very anal</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:40:51] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I need something very organized well thought out.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:41:04] &lt;suprsonic&gt; and FreeBSD fit that requirement with ports</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:43:26] &lt;zenethian&gt; Courtesy of bash.org: &lt;Algorithms&gt; I just threw a squirrel carcass in a cardboard box and installed NetBSD on it.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:49:25] &lt;zenethian&gt; (I am a NetBSD fanboy)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:50:03] &lt;suprsonic&gt; got zenoss running on it?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:50:20] &lt;zenethian&gt; Nope never tried.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:50:36] &lt;zenethian&gt; I know, I'm useless.&#160; :-)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:50:41] &lt;suprsonic&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:50:50] &lt;zenethian&gt; I should try it someday.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:51:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I've seen NetBSD &amp; OpenBSD installs</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:51:28] &lt;zenethian&gt; Though I should disclaim that I've only worked for Zenoss for 4 days now, so I've only installed it on Ubuntu and Mac OS X thus far.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:51:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; right now it's 92% Linux, 7% OSX, 1% FreeBSD</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:52:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and a handful of OpenSolaris installs</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:52:05] &lt;zenethian&gt; I'm sure that someday I'll feel masochistic enough to try installing to some flavor of BSD.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 11:55:39] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I know its something very simple Im missing</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:21:02] &lt;eidolon&gt; this is... odd.&#160; i'm getting 'localhost zenprocess heartbeat failure' - but settings-&gt;daemons shows everything up and running.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:32:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; ports pales in comparison to portage</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:32:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and aptitude is just as well maintained</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:33:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; portage is available for freebsd though</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:36:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll have to setup a freebsd vm and screw around with it to see what's new</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:36:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; eidolon: false reading? try clear all heartbeats?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:36:34] &lt;suprsonic&gt; wait until 8.0</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:36:46] &lt;eidolon&gt; i just did a clear all heartbeats to see what's up.&#160; so far it hasn't recurred (did some googling)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:36:48] &lt;suprsonic&gt; will be out soon</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:36:57] &lt;suprsonic&gt; some awesome features in it</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:36:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are up to 8? wow</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:37:03] &lt;suprsonic&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:37:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; mrayzenoss: you get those stats above from the zenoss servers checking in to see if an update is available?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:37:09] &lt;suprsonic&gt; production ZFS</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:37:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; I started on 4 or 5 (can't remember which)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:37:17] &lt;suprsonic&gt; zfs ftw!</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:37:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; think it was really late in to 4, going in to 5</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:38:12] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: yeah</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:38:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's anonymous data</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:41:52] &lt;RoundQube&gt; where are the logs stored say if an interface (fa6/39) went down on a switch?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:46:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; rutroh, its nerfgun day</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 12:47:06] &lt;twm1010&gt;

Well, hold on.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 13:35:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 13:35:48] &lt;twm1010&gt; Wait... no.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 13:35:57] &lt;davetoo&gt;

That model seems like a good one for our new cluster-centric product</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 13:36:43] &lt;reyjrar&gt; I've got like 55 hosts to do now, and by the time I finish puppet integration it may be 150..</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 13:37:02] &lt;reyjrar&gt;

I know there was a zendmd way to do it</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:44:07] &lt;jmp242&gt; Let me coalese a bit on new users - the FAQs are much easier to find on the new forums, but still seem to be not discovered by the new users</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:44:09] &lt;rocket&gt; but thats not very user friendly to a cmdline phobe ..</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:44:34] &lt;rocket&gt; perms and settings that is .. eg alerting rules etc</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:44:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; jmp242: I'll add the FAQ to the download followup email</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:45:13] &lt;jmp242&gt; per rocket, I think some way to get a console at the webgui level ... more interactive than just the commands you can create</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:45:35] &lt;jmp242&gt; might be cool - there are some projects for that IIRC already in the OSS world.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:45:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; interesting idea</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:45:50] &lt;jmp242&gt; Basically, there are a lot of users who don't seem to get SSH, or putty or whatever</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:45:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:46:00] &lt;jmp242&gt; and how it's different than the web GUI logon</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:46:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; another product I worked on had a hidden SQL prompt</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:46:27] &lt;jmp242&gt; but somewhat combining some of the dual or triple or quadruple nature of Zenoss might help new admins</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:46:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so maybe a zendmd shell or even a full shell</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:46:56] &lt;jmp242&gt; yea, maybe zendmd</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:47:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'll throw that into an enhancement ticket for Stone Crab</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:47:20] &lt;jmp242&gt; somehow you have the security problems though, so maybe some sort of ksu style SSH java client</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:47:38] &lt;jmp242&gt; where the zenoss users can ksu to the command line to be the linux zenoss user</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:47:50] &lt;jmp242&gt; so you have the auditing, and you're not just giving everyone a shell either</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:48:11] &lt;jmp242&gt; but it's sort of hidden from the user</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:49:06] &lt;jmp242&gt; you know, the web java SSH client will log in with a zenossuser (GUI level user), so zenoss creates local accounts or some such for that user (or allows linking accounts for existing unix infrastructure), and then it auto ksus to zenoss</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:49:11] &lt;jmp242&gt; when you bring up the applet</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:50:17] &lt;jmp242&gt; I've just noticed a bunch of people posting recently who aren't really linux people trying to do fairly complex stuff right away</span><br/><span><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:52:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

seriously you'd probably save money on time alone.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:56:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; its in the works, i did an analysis&#160; a few months back and figure out that the reports that come off this thing could easily go electronic, and stay that way</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:57:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; Between the power consumption, materials, and support costs we're going to save $56,000/yr</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:57:34] &lt;zenethian&gt; nice, you could hire a minion with the savings.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:57:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; For some reason they didn't see that as a reason to give me a $56,000/yr raise, but... oh wel</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:58:06] &lt;zenethian&gt; they should at least give you 10%</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:58:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; Well unless sales pick up, we expect raises to continue to be frozen next year.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:58:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; heh, I saved the State of TX over $100K a year as an intern&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; didn't get a raise</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:58:35] &lt;rocket&gt; twm1010: I have an incremental savings of over $400,000 a year here in hardware costs and I dont see that either :p</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:58:55] &lt;rocket&gt; mrayzenoss: I beat you :p</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:58:57] &lt;twm1010&gt; good to know i'm not alone :)</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 14:59:34] &lt;zenethian&gt; I saved $200 by switching to Geico.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 15:00:03] &lt;rocket&gt; once we are done reworking the ibm support disaster recovery contract to use the new server model the total savings will probably approach nearly a million or so ... :/</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 15:00:45] &lt;rocket&gt;

where do i go to set thresholds for Perf/Interface?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 17:14:35] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok so this is annoying, I have a device or 2 the snmp collector has decided to stop collecting ifHCInOctets on but its collecting the others</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 17:16:34] &lt;kobalt&gt; majikman: you click on devices, then hit the down arrow and choose all templates</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 17:16:55] &lt;kobalt&gt; the interface templates have the threshold you should have ethercsmd and the 64 one</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 17:17:35] &lt;kobalt&gt; its &gt; all templates&gt; then either ethernetCsmacd or ethernetCsmacd_64</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 17:17:49] &lt;majikman&gt; ahh... thanks</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 17:18:06] &lt;majikman&gt; what happesn if i create a custom one and i forget under which template i created it for? is there an easier way to search for it?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 17:18:30] &lt;kobalt&gt; not that I know of, but you can see all the templates there</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 17:20:24] &lt;majikman&gt; hmm.... that'd be a nice feature to have if someone has a lot of templates. it can be a pain to have to go through all the templates to find the threshold</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:01:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:01:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm sure all the Zenoss brand people are gone,</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:01:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; or at least the developers :0</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:11:00] &lt;kobalt&gt; hehe yeah</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:11:36] &lt;kobalt&gt; ever had zenoss stop graphing on ifHCInOctets but it does the outs?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:11:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; no</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:12:14] &lt;kobalt&gt; mine has done it on like only a couple devices</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:12:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; which version?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:12:36] &lt;kobalt&gt; of zenoss?</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:12:38] &lt;davetoo&gt;

thinking about restarting zenoss</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:18:41] &lt;davetoo&gt; check event.log, zenhub.log, and zenperfsenmp.log for errors,</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:18:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; in particular snmp timeouts</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:18:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; that's what usually causes dropped samples</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:19:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; and with that, I'm off for the weekend.</span><br/><span> [23-Oct-2009 18:19:16] &lt;kobalt&gt;

?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:39:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; No A Number</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:39:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; blah</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:39:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Not A Number</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:40:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it means the values haven't been recorded yet</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:40:26] &lt;suprsonic&gt; mrayzenoss correct me if Im wrong, but you're interested in the freebsd port of zenoss right?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:40:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; absolutely</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:40:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we're about to push out 2.5</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:40:56] &lt;suprsonic&gt; well traps dont work</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:40:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and the Subversion trunk is going to switch to Python 2.6 and Zope 2.12</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:41:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; at all?&#160; there are a lot of FreeBSD users</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:41:35] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I tested freebsd and ubuntu using the same host sending traps</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:41:46] &lt;suprsonic&gt; only ubuntu works</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:41:52] &lt;kobalt&gt; so I have a graph that use to graph and then it stopped.... only on the in Octets it use to work, I can snmpwalk it and I have removed the rrd file and let it rebuild and its not graphing and giving nan</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:42:08] &lt;suprsonic&gt; socket is open, but nothing gets processed</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:43:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: it takes 15 mins for it to start graphing</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:43:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; 3 polling cycles</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:43:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll see "nan" until then</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:43:45] &lt;kobalt&gt; I deleted and restarted zenoss on friday...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:43:45] &lt;kobalt&gt; its nan this morning</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:44:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; suprsonic: did you 'chown root:zenoss /usr/local/zenoss/bin/zensocket' and 'chmod 04750 /usr/local/zenoss/bin/zensocket' ?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:44:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you tested the datasource?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:44:29] &lt;kobalt&gt; yes, like I said it use to work hehe</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:44:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to the template, click on the data source, put the device name in to the test field and click test</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:44:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure you actually get output</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:44:42] &lt;kobalt&gt; it works</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:44:52] &lt;suprsonic&gt; mrayzenoss I have</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:45:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you only said that you can snmpwalk the device, that isn't proof that you can snmpwalk that particular value</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:45:01] &lt;suprsonic&gt; -rwsr-x---&#160; 1 root&#160; zenoss&#160; 15305 Oct 23 15:22 zensocket</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:45:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've actually seen OIDs wander</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:45:35] &lt;kobalt&gt; when I say I snmpwalked it I did the actual oid that its not gathering</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:45:50] &lt;kobalt&gt; plus the test from the template works</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:47:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; in some cases the OID will display a value in an snmpwalk (which is what the test uses), but Zenoss won't like it because it's actually an SNMP index value rather than a specific OID</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:47:58] &lt;kobalt&gt; its funny it seems to be just this one interface, it graphs the data from other interfaces</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:47:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; for instance, it could show more than just 1 value, but it's not</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:48:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; try adding a .0 or .1 to the end of the OID</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:48:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; see if it picks up the value after doing that</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:48:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; suprsonic: I don't know&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; there must be something missing.&#160; I know there are a lots of FreeBSD systems in production environments...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:48:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I just don't run it myself</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:48:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: what kind of interface is it though?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:49:09] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: its a gig interface on a router, using the same 64 template that my other 4 routers are using lol</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:49:26] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I'll keep at it</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:49:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; suprsonic: I'll keep an eye out and ask around</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:50:00] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: it does not make sense, it use to work then it just stopped graphing in octets, other interfaces work fine</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:50:21] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I found a post back in 2008 looking for the same solution that I'm experience, but no reply.</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:50:38] &lt;suprsonic&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.mail-archive.com/zenoss-users@zenoss.org/msg23956.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/zenoss-users@zenoss.org/msg23956.html</a><a class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto://www.mail-archive.com/zenoss-users@zenoss.org">//www.mail-archive.com/zenoss-users@zenoss.org</a><span>/msg23956.html</span></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:54:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, this doesn't relate to Zenoss or anything that I directly need to know, have a friend who is in college, a question on one of his assignments is what the difference in the following 2 lines means in a syslog.conf file...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:54:36] &lt;rmatte&gt;

what's the - mean before /var... on the first line</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:54:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've been scouring through manpages and see no reference to it</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 09:56:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, apparently it means "Don't sync after each write"</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:16:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: no idea then, delete the RRD again, restart Zenoss, and see if that fixes it</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:17:03] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: thats what I did on friday not sure what is going on but thanks =)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:17:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, if the template is applied to it properly, the OID is walkable, and nothing has changed since it was last working then there obviously shouldn't be anything wrong with it</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:18:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, was the port up when you modeled it?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:18:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it's showing as down on the OS tab you won't get a graph</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:18:56] &lt;kobalt&gt; it is up</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:19:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's actually showing as up on the OS tab in Zenoss?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:19:09] &lt;kobalt&gt; its been up for quite a long time</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:19:10] &lt;kobalt&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:19:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:19:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; then no idea</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:19:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:19:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; I need to find a friend with a BFR to do a full snmp walk</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:20:35] &lt;kobalt&gt; Im remodeling it, then pushing changes to see if that makes any changes</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:22:26] &lt;davetoo&gt;

kobalt: actually I didn't even think about that, network equipment has a tendency to change the interface indexes</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:26:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: but Zenoss saves the indexes when it models</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:26:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: so a remodel will probably fix it</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:26:40] Cthalupa2 is now known as Cthalupa</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:26:54] &lt;kobalt&gt; funny thing is I am getting out octets</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:27:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: hmmm, that's really weird then</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:27:11] &lt;kobalt&gt; its not like its not graphing anything its only graphing outs</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:27:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; because if that were the case you wouldn't be getting anything lol</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:27:44] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: yeah fun stuff ! lol</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:28:40] mattd is now known as mdereus</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:28:49] mdereus is now known as mdereus`</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:29:17] mdereus` is now known as mdereus</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:29:25] &lt;mdereus&gt;

Are there any documents on best practices for Zenoss? By default it reports a lot of event errors that I don't care about.</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:54:41] &lt;Diddi&gt; is it possible to modify event messages? Right now I've got an event saying "threshold of high utilization exceeded: current value 4095735",&#160; which I've found out is the transfer speed of the network card</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:58:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Diddi: yeah, take a look at some of these: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../community/documentation/wiki/event_transforms.html">community/documentation/wiki/event_transforms</a></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:58:58] &lt;Diddi&gt; great, i'll look into it. thanks!</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 10:59:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; mdereus: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2521.html">docs/DOC-2521</a><span> has some tips&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; a lot of best practices are around getting everything monitored, then turning down the volume of things you care to pay attention to</span></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:05:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:05:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; I've been advised by a few zenoss, inc folks that running that many hub worker threads might not work well</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:06:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; how many?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:06:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I think the rule of thumb is 1 per core?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:07:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or, don't exceed that</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:07:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; I keep hearing that after three or four, the "master" hub process gets too tied up dispatching to the workers</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:07:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; well, I have a 16-core machine :)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:07:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, 1 per core isn't necessarily the best...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:07:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; on a 4 core system I do 3 zenhub workers</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:07:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, I guess 16 would be nuts</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:07:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it just shifts the bottleneck</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:07:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; whichy basically gives 1 core to the other processes</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:08:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: ok, but how much processing power?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:08:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; 15GHz?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:09:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; Xeon 3ghz</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:09:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, didn't even know those could do 16 on a single chip</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:09:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; isn't that 4x4?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:09:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes, 4x4</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:10:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so you have 4 xeons in there then</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:10:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; suprsonic: Casey Hillman's page is down right now, I assume you followed </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3514.html">docs/DOC-3514</a><span> right?</span></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:10:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; so 12GHz?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:10:37] &lt;davetoo&gt; It was purchased to be a VMWare host I think,</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:10:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was just about to say, why the heck aren't you running ESX on that beast</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:10:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:11:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; quite honestly, if you're installing Zenoss on the actual physical server, that's going to blow it out of the water no matter how many workers you run :P</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:11:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd run 8 workers and then set some of the other zenoss processes to run parallel processes</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:12:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; (some of them support the "parallel #" option in their configs, where # is the number of parallel processes to run</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:12:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; actually I'm not sure that will end up being the production master</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:12:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; I usually just do "parallel 2"</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:19:22] &lt;RoundQube&gt; hello all</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:19:57] &lt;RoundQube&gt; Zenoss all of a sudden on Friday stopped drawing graphs. I restrated the server (and zenoss/mysql services) to no avail. Any ideas on what I can try next?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:20:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: when did you restart Zenoss?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:21:01] &lt;RoundQube&gt; about 45 mins ago</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:21:03] &lt;gwb235&gt; drawing graphs, or putting data into the graphs?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:21:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: have you done a "zenoss status" to make sure that all of the daemons are running?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:21:22] &lt;RoundQube&gt; gwb235 drawing as far as I know for now, i haven't looked at the database to see if the data is there</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:21:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: you just don't see any graphs?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:21:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; or are there actual errors?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:22:01] &lt;gwb235&gt; drawing vs. updating.&#160; if it's problems updating only, are the updates/data points from zencommand or zenperfsnmp?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:22:25] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte correct, it may have been after installing zenpacks... how do I uninstall them? looking at the zenpacks tab, it errors regarding the asterisk zenpack... which makes sense since that crap is unstable lol</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:22:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: so you don't see any graph images no matter where you check?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:22:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; (I just want to get this 100% clear)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:22:57] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte nope, not in any of my 18 devices</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:23:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: ok, have you tried a different browser or viewing it from a different computer?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:23:26] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte IE/Firefox and diff computers</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:23:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: or clearing your cache for that matter</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:23:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: can you post a screenshot?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:24:05] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte of the zenpack error? sure</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:24:18] &lt;RoundQube&gt; i just want to uninstall tha asterisk zenpack</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:24:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, of what not seeing the graphs looks like</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:24:25] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte ok sure thing one sec</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:24:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:24:56] &lt;RoundQube&gt; im sure its related to the zenpacks, now that I recall Friday afternoon I was messing with the Asterisk zenpack and now Monday i come to see no graphs are being drawn</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:25:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I just need to see a screenshot to see if it's a template binding issue or an actual technical issue</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:26:16] &lt;RoundQube&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.imgur.com/XHy7T">http://www.imgur.com/XHy7T</a></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:26:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so it's not what I though</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:26:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're not actually physically unable to see the graphs, they are just not drawing data</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:27:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: is it ONLY on interfaces, or is it literally every single graph?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:27:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; which means the rrd files are there, they just aren't getting populated</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:27:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:28:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm just trying to figure out if his problem is only related to interfaces or every single graph</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:28:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; need to be very specific</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:28:49] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte every single graph</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:29:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; throw me a screenshot of performance graphs</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:29:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; memory and cpu</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:29:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; for example</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:29:22] &lt;RoundQube&gt; you'll see the same thing, empty graphs</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:29:24] &lt;RoundQube&gt; will get them for you though</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:29:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:30:50] &lt;RoundQube&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.imgur.com/TFB5c">http://www.imgur.com/TFB5c</a></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:32:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, you've checked "zenoss status" to make sure everything is running?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:32:58] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte all good there</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:33:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; check your zenhub log file</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:33:22] &lt;RoundQube&gt; i tried removing the zenpacks i installed friday but it states "not installed"</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:33:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; also your zenperfsnmp log file</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:33:33] &lt;RoundQube&gt; but the zenpacks tab on web interface errors</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:33:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you restart zenoss before or after you installed the packs?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:34:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; what version of Zenoss are you running?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:34:10] &lt;RoundQube&gt; restarted zenoss after installing zenpacks because it needed Zope to be restarted</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:34:21] &lt;RoundQube&gt;

hmmm, ok, let's try something...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:38:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; you know what zendmd is I assume?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:39:31] &lt;RoundQube&gt; i dont, also zenhub is not running</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:40:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you do a "zenhub start" as the zenoss user, what happens</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:40:49] &lt;RoundQube&gt; stays starting then completed successfuly but after i run 'service zenoss status' it shows not running</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:41:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you just type "zenoss status"</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:41:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; does it show as running?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:41:32] &lt;RoundQube&gt; not running</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:41:40] &lt;RoundQube&gt; everything else is running&#160; however</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:41:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, I don't know if this will work with zenhub not running but hopefully...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:41:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; as the zenoss user, type zendmd</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:41:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; no, needs zenhub</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:42:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, shitty</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:42:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; zeo, zope, zenhub</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:42:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; do zenhub start -v10</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:42:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; see if it shows any errors</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:42:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; also check $ZENHOME/log/zenhub.log</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:42:46] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte no errors</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:42:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; check the log</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:43:43] &lt;RoundQube&gt;

(I hate it when Zenoss gets that screwed up, becomes ridiculously difficult to fix...)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:44:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; y'know, maybe I should go back to sleep</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:44:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: eugh, can you restart that entire server?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:44:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; I think zendmd can run without zenhub after all</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:44:14] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte did that before i came on here</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:44:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; like the physical server?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:44:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: ok, try typing zendmd</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:44:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: I thought so, it interfaces directly with zope</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:44:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; so as long as zope is running it should work</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:44:54] &lt;rmatte&gt;

bah</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:52:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:52:57] &lt;RoundQube&gt; let me just backup my database and reinstall</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:52:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; check /opt/zenoss/ZenPacks/ZenPacks.AndreaConsadori.Asterisk-1.2-py2.4.egg/ZenPacks/AndreaConsadori/Asterisk/skins/ZenPacks.AndreaConsadori.Asterisk</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:53:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; see if it actually exists or not</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:53:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; do the same for...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:53:09] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte doesn't exist</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:53:17] &lt;RoundQube&gt; i removed them, like a dumbass earlier hehe</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:53:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you pretty much screwed your system</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:53:40] &lt;RoundQube&gt; damn</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:53:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; don't just go randomly deleting stuff like that :P</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:53:53] &lt;RoundQube&gt; lesson learned =)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:54:06] &lt;RoundQube&gt; ill reinstall, just need to figure out how to backup the mysql database and restore later</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:54:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; deleting zenpack directories is like one of the absolute worst things you can possibly do</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:54:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; deleting a zenpack directory does not delete the zenpack from Zenoss, so never do that</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:54:50] &lt;RoundQube&gt; learned that now i guess hehe</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:54:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:55:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; there might still be a way to salvage the install, but how long would it take to reinstall and reconfigure everything?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:55:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; was this a relatively new install?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:56:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually hold on, I have an idea</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:56:10] &lt;RoundQube&gt; very new, just added devices manually (18 of them) so i dont want to repeat that</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:56:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; do you still have the zenpack files?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:56:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; (the eggs)?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:56:18] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte yes i do</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:56:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, if you unzip those eggs you'll get a zenpack directory</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:56:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; do that for each egg and move the directory in to /opt/zenoss/ZenPacks/</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:56:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; hopefully that'll work</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:57:00] &lt;RoundQube&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:57:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; If it does then we can probably use zendmd to remove those packs (if they still aren't functioning correctly)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:58:00] &lt;RoundQube&gt; how do i backup from the command line just in case for now?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:58:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; just tar up $ZENHOME basically</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 11:59:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; wow, google updated their HTML PDF reader to not suck</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:00:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; tar czf complete-backup.tar.gz $ZENHOME</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:00:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; do that</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:00:57] &lt;RoundQube&gt; got it</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:01:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:12:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; there he is!</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:12:35] * rmatte points at cgibbons </span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:12:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; get him!</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:17:56] &lt;mdereus&gt; mrayzenoss: Thanks for the link, sorry had to step away for a while</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:33:16] &lt;Jimbo1228&gt; hey guys, I'm getting an error 20 when trying to install zenpacks through the zenos interface, I've rename the file to .zip but its still giving me an error</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:33:18] &lt;Jimbo1228&gt; any ideas?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:35:14] &lt;RoundQube&gt; Jimbo1228 unzip it so you get the .egg file inside, dont just rename it</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:35:25] &lt;RoundQube&gt; then use the webinterface to install the .egg zenpack</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:36:08] &lt;mdereus&gt; I had that problem at first too. :)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:37:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; Jimbo1228: it's not supposed to be an egg, the new Zenoss site automatically zips all the packs</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:37:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to unzip it to get a .egg and install that</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:37:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; as RoundQube said</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:40:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; RoundQube: any luck with fixing your install?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:40:41] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte i got the zenpack errors to go away, awaiting the graphs to see if they populate</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:40:47] &lt;RoundQube&gt; assuming it will be 30mins or so</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:40:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:41:05] &lt;RoundQube&gt; zenhub is now running</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:41:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; why did you delete the zenpack directories in the first place?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:41:14] &lt;Jimbo1228&gt; rmatte: I unzipped it and it extracted it to a folder instead of an egg file</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:41:33] &lt;RoundQube&gt; rmatte figured that was the way to uninstall... need to read docs more</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:41:49] &lt;mdereus&gt; Reading is your friend. :)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:41:54] &lt;mdereus&gt; and searching</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:42:02] &lt;RoundQube&gt; mdereus indeed, it saves a lot of headache in the future</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:42:04] &lt;mdereus&gt; when I exhaust all searching then I post here or the forum</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 12:51:01] &lt;etank&gt;

based on the event id</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:33:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;&#160; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2554.html">docs/DOC-2554</a></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:34:02] &lt;etank&gt; mrayzenoss: yeah</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:34:28] &lt;etank&gt; basically i just want an event with qcm_CollectDataJob_ in the summary or message to be put in history</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:34:53] &lt;etank&gt; does what i have look like it would work? how can i test it?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:35:10] &lt;etank&gt; i tried creating an event manually but it stays in status</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:43:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; etank: is the event coming in with /Unknown event classification?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:45:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; etank: you may not actually even need a transform for what you're trying to do</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:46:09] &lt;etank&gt; rmatte: no. it is in /App/Jobs</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:46:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; you don't need the \S+ at the end for starters</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:46:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; since re.search searches from start to end</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:46:49] &lt;etank&gt; ok.</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:47:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; import re</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:47:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; if re.search('qcm_CollectDataJob_', evt.summary):</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:47:36] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; evt._action='history'</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:47:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what you want</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:48:04] &lt;etank&gt; isnt that essentially what i have?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:48:20] &lt;etank&gt; i just used a variable to hold what it is that i want to match</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:48:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, yeh, but you're overcomplicating it by setting the variable</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:48:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not necessary</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:48:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; keep it as simple as possible</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:48:48] &lt;etank&gt; and this needs to go in the transform</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:48:54] &lt;etank&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:49:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; that is the transform, yeh</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:49:44] &lt;etank&gt; i see my biggest problem</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:49:50] &lt;etank&gt; no : after the if</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:49:57] &lt;etank&gt; stupid mistakes :/</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:49:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, when the event comes in does it have an eventClassKey?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:50:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I assume you're setting that in the general transform for that class, but if it has an eventClassKey you should really be mapping the event and then applying the transform to the mapping</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:50:36] &lt;etank&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:51:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; event mappings are best practice whenever possible.</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:51:23] &lt;etank&gt; it is already in eventClassKey&#160; SQLSERVERAGENT_208</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:51:34] &lt;etank&gt; i am putting the transform there</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 13:52:44] &lt;etank&gt; so does it sound like im doing it right rmatte ?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:02:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; sorry, had to step away for a minute...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:02:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, sounds like you're doing it right...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:14:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; time to setup a new Zenoss VM, woohoo</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:14:42] &lt;superdug&gt;

yes, we do want women in bikinis at the prize ceremony</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:50:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; next question</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:50:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:50:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; would you prefer 4 prizes handed out by a judges based on quality, complexity, utility, or do you like having a random element to the winners?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:50:47] &lt;zenethian&gt; In order to comply with anti-sexism laws, we must also have an equal number of men in bikinis then.&#160; :P</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:50:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; oh no</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:51:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; like 2 by judges, 2 by random?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:51:08] * zenethian grins</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:51:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the thinking being that random prizes encourages people to contribute stuff that may not win, but is still useful</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:51:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; but if we go all prizes by judges, people may submit more complex stuff, thinking they have better odds of winning</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:51:55] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: I looked at zenperfsnmp.log and it seems there is a error</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 14:52:34] &lt;kobalt&gt;

lol was just going to ask that</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:10:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, zendmd won't work unless Zenoss is running</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:10:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:10:35] &lt;kobalt&gt; that is what I thought</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:10:39] &lt;kobalt&gt; but wanted to make sure</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:10:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; zeodb and zope at least</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:12:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:13:27] &lt;kobalt&gt; woot no errors</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:13:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice, that's the second Zope db that I've saved today</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:13:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:13:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm on a roll</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:13:53] &lt;kobalt&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:14:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; now if you re-add the device that you removed everything should hopefully work properly</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:14:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm sure that corrupt device was the issue</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:14:11] &lt;kobalt&gt; lets see if it works now hehe</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:16:24] &lt;kobalt&gt; yeah I was not able to readd the device</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:16:24] &lt;kobalt&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m56ede9ea">http://pastebin.com/m56ede9ea</a></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:16:24] &lt;kobalt&gt; thats from /Deviceloader</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:18:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:18:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; so that's when you try to add the device back?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:18:45] &lt;kobalt&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:18:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; crap...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:18:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:19:25] &lt;kobalt&gt; I tried to add it by host name, I would try to add it by ip</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:19:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, try by ip</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:19:51] &lt;kobalt&gt; could that is</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:20:59] &lt;kobalt&gt; I did a easy add so lets see what it does</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:21:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, did you restart Zenoss after the reindex?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:21:37] &lt;kobalt&gt; well it added it by ip but did not set the host name</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:21:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, rename it to the hostname</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:22:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; Manage -&gt; Rename Device I believe</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:22:13] &lt;kobalt&gt; no I did not restart after the reindex do I need to</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:22:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; I would do a restart just for good measure</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:23:01] &lt;kobalt&gt; restarting it</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:23:40] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok added and restarted</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:23:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:23:55] &lt;kobalt&gt; should I delete the RRD files and see if it will collect now?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:23:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; after the restart try renaming the device to what it was before</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:23:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; then try anothe reindex</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:24:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; and see if it errors again</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:24:11] &lt;kobalt&gt; I renamed it then restarted</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:24:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, don't mess with the RRDs just yet</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:24:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; try the reindex anyways</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:24:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it finishes without errors then you're good</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:24:41] &lt;kobalt&gt; trying the reindex</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:24:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; otherwise this will get a bit more complex to fix</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:31:43] &lt;kobalt&gt; done no errors!</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:31:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: I replied to </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../message/41149.html#41149#41149">message/41149#41149</a></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:31:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; good</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:31:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; now see if it'll graph properly</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:32:19] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok we will see in about 15 minutes</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:32:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: thanks.&#160; How long does pastebin store stuff?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:32:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I made that one forever</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:32:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; it defaults to a month</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:33:12] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; hi to all. I have the following problem: Zenoss is pulling the routing table from the cisco 3745 router via SNMP.&#194;&#160; It should not do this - the routing table has 400,000+ routes and this raises the CPU utilization on the router. How can I disable it?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:33:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: easy to fix...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:34:15] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; mrayzenoss: evening... have you found some info regarding patch 15003 for FreeBSD?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:34:31] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; rmatte: remove routes?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:34:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: well, are you complaining about the fact that Zenoss even tries to collect them, or about the fact that it's saving them in Zenoss?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:35:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; what I was going to suggest is that you go in to zProperties and change zRouteMapCollectOnlyLocal to True</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:35:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; that'll keep it from actually storing the routes in Zenoss</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:35:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; though it may still try to gather the routes (I don't think it does though)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:35:43] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; rmatte: oh.. thanks :)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:36:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; It'll still collect local routes</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:36:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I doubt that those 400000 routes are local</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:36:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; BGP I'm guessing?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:36:25] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; yep.</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:36:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:36:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; we had similar issues with some devices for one of our clients, setting that option seems to have helped a lot</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:36:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's worth a shot</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:37:12] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; btw. some one faced problems with the level3 recently?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:37:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; sergeymasushko: what's the issue with 15003?&#160; It's included in 2.5, I doubt we'll push out a 2.4.6</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:37:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; (we didn't quite have like 400000 routes to deal with though, but it was probably like 50000-100000</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:37:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: FreeBSD users can't use zenpatch, it doesn't work</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:38:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; oh...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:38:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: also, I tried to walk someone through patching it by hand the other day but that didn't work either for some reason</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:38:35] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; mrayzenoss: we've talked about it in the channel on Mon, Oct.19</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:38:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; they should technically be able to download the .patch file and do: patch whatever.file &lt; whatever.patch</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:39:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it doesn't seem to work for whatever reason</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:39:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; let's get another ticket for zenpatch on FreeBSD then&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; maybe we can get someone from </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../groups/freebsd.html">groups/freebsd</a><span> to weigh in on the ticket once it's opened</span></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:40:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; is it some sort of assumption of path?</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:40:31] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m41fe8e58">http://pastebin.com/m41fe8e58</a></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:40:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I believe so, but I'm not 100% sure (don't remember)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:40:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh right, that's what it is</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:41:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not able to actually locate the files to patch them</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:41:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; but when you manually specify the location of the file that doesn't seem to work either</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:41:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: specify the path to the files by hand when it prompts, and paste what you get</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:41:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; some sort of BSD version of patch?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:41:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; are there differences between BSD patch and GNU patch?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:41:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; BSD should use the exact same patch utility</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:41:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't think it's different than the linux on</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:42:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; one*</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:42:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; just brainstorming</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:42:34] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m5d3ea541">http://pastebin.com/m5d3ea541</a></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:43:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, so it's not patching cleanly for whatever reason</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:44:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; sergeymasushko: you could technically do those modifications by hand, but there's really no reason why patch shouldn't be able to do it</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:45:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; looks like you missed a patch</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:45:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, did he?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:45:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; according to pastebin, he went from 11466 to 15003</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:45:30] &lt;rmatte&gt;

13190 is the version before 15003</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:47:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 11466 is older</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:47:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; then I assume he installed from source</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:47:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm guessing the source build is flawed</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:48:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; dunno, I always build from source</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:48:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, how do you explain having an older version of that file?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:49:02] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; on the web interface on the settings-&gt;versions I see the following: Zenoss: &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Zenoss 2.4.5</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:49:02] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; OS: &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;FreeBSD (i386) 7.1.0</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:49:02] &lt;rmatte&gt;

so the 2.4.5 source probably includes old versions of files</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:52:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the only way I can explain that</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 15:52:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

ah</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:03:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; which means that not only does the ZMI properties view blow up for those,</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:04:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; a couple of tools that I have that depend upon that, no longer work</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:04:08] &lt;davetoo&gt;

that would be more of a question for someone like cluther or cgibbons methinks</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:27:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; that's why I prefixed it with 'cgibbons: you still here?'&#160;

mrayzenoss: if someone were to download the demo of the enterprise version of Zenoss, I was under the impression that they would no longer be able to use Core (as they've already had exposure to the enterprise code and enterprise ZenPack code)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:36:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: Is that true?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:37:12] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; no, we've had people use the Enterprise demo, then decide they don't have the budget</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:37:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Sales sends them to me to introduce to the Community</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:37:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok, someone here was under that impression for whatever reason and explained it to me that way</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:37:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; are current enterprise users entitled to use core as well?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:37:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'd assume they have the courtesy to not copy code from Enterprise</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:37:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; they are and they do</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:37:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:38:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; good to know</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:38:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we depend on the good behavior of our customers</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:38:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's a good stance to take really</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:38:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:39:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's hard to take any other stance when you deliver source</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:39:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; :p</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:39:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:39:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; although someone with exposure to enterprise packs could duplicate the functionality without directly copying the code</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:39:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you'd really never know</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:39:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well, that's why I'm the gatekeeper for ZenPacks hosted by us</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:39:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:40:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I mean, I have run into ZenPack piracy before, but what can I do?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:40:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:40:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, we're being legit about it, was just curious :)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:40:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; no problem</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:40:53] &lt;kobalt&gt; mrayzenoss: any word on making the netflow zenpack open to the public</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:41:12] &lt;rmatte&gt;

hrm</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:53:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok do zenoss stop</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:53:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; and check zenoss status until everything is completely stopped</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 16:54:04] &lt;rmatte&gt;

nice, so it's complaining about that exact same device</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:00:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; I honestly don't know how to fix that... well, I sort of do, you'd have to do it from the zope management interface, try to find the entry for that device and delete it, but it's tricky and easy to screw something up</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:00:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; you might be better off just doing a completely reinstall</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:00:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; complete*</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:00:39] &lt;kobalt&gt; ...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:02:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, might as well give it a shot...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:02:12] &lt;kobalt&gt; it just squawked at me removing that device</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:02:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; after your Zenoss URL (whatever.com:8180) put zport/dmd/Devices/manage</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:02:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; then on the left navigate to the device class for that device</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:02:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; so /Server/Linux or whatever</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:02:54] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:02:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; then click on "devices" in the right pane</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:03:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you should see the device</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:03:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; put a checkmark next to it and select delete...</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:03:22] &lt;kobalt&gt; its not there</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:03:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; does it show up in the device list at all?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:03:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; (you did just try to remove it)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:04:30] &lt;kobalt&gt; its not there now</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:04:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:04:42] &lt;rmatte&gt;

in the log it gives the same about spn-bsw0</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:06:43] &lt;kobalt&gt; is this a db issue?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:06:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, it is</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:06:49] &lt;kobalt&gt; or somthing esle</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:06:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; a zope db issue</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:07:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's something leftover in the db from that device</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:07:04] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you wouldn't really want to because in all probability saving the node list would save the problem as well</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:11:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; quite honestly though, if it's only 18 devices that's not much</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:11:48] &lt;davetoo&gt;

472....</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:12:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; you said you only have 18 in there</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:12:28] &lt;kobalt&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:12:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh wait nevermind, that was the last guy I helped with zope today</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:12:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so 472, hmmm</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:13:25] &lt;kobalt&gt; I was going to say lol</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:13:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh, you need sleep :)</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:13:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; instead of a reinstall you're going to want to fix this then lol</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:13:25] &lt;kobalt&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:13:26] &lt;kobalt&gt; plus I have a lot of custom templates built</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:13:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; ask cgibbons or cluther if you see them around, I have to go soon but I'll see if I can dig up a solution before I leave</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:15:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmmm</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:15:49] &lt;davetoo&gt; well I have a tool</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:15:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; is there a directory left over in $ZENHOME/Perf for the device that you deleted?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:15:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; and a patch to zenbatchload to fix it,</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:16:04] &lt;davetoo&gt; but the tool isn't sanitized for outside use</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:16:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm just trying to figure out why it's even still trying to look for that device name</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:19:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, I'm out of ideas for today and I need to head home</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:19:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll be around tomorrow</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:21:25] &lt;kobalt&gt; no file in the perf dir</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:23:24] &lt;kobalt&gt; oye this sucks lol</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:23:37] &lt;kobalt&gt; I really dont want to load 472 devices again</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:26:51] &lt;kobalt&gt; did you say you had somthing to fix my issue davetoo ?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:29:53] &lt;davetoo&gt; not to fix your issue,</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:30:07] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:30:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; but I made some fixes to zenbatchload</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:30:16] &lt;kobalt&gt; thats what I thought just wanted to make sure</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:30:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; and wrote a tool to dump my device list into that format</span><br/><span><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:31:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="thread/11793?tstart=0">thread/11793?tstart=0</a></span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:33:41] &lt;davetoo&gt; So you could could, as a hack, capture your Device List table and edit into a format usable by zenbatchload</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 17:49:23] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok got that part fixed woot now it actually starts</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 20:47:57] &lt;Diddi&gt; hi! i'm trying to add threshold for my software raid.. but after configuring everything I get "Error reading value for ..... oid ### is bad", but I can snmpwalk and get the values just fine from command line</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 20:48:07] &lt;Diddi&gt; am I missing something?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 20:52:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; verify the snmp indices; if you've rebooted the server since you modeled it, they could have changed.&#160; Also verify the snmp version that zenoss is using, compared to your snmpwalk call.</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 20:52:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; zenoss defaults to v1</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 20:52:54] &lt;Diddi&gt; v1 works when I snmpwalk from cli from the zenoss-server.. that makes me feel that it shouldn't be any problem</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 20:54:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; does v2 work?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 20:54:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; remodel it anyway</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 20:55:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; that's the most common cause of that</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 20:55:10] &lt;Diddi&gt; alright</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 21:14:24] &lt;Diddi&gt; hm, that didn't work</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 21:20:27] &lt;Diddi&gt; or maybe it did.. :p</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 21:26:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; which version you running?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 21:27:08] &lt;davetoo&gt; What happens when you run 'zenperfsnmp run -v10 -d &lt;devicename&gt;'?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 21:27:14] * davetoo going off to dinner, back later</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 21:34:00] &lt;Diddi&gt; debug and info messages flashing by.. but I can't see anything about my swraid.. and I can't see any error/warning</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 21:46:32] &lt;Diddi&gt; in the template for the device, when I add snmp source, there's a button for testing the source. Testing it returns correct value, but I still get debug-messages that oid is bad</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 22:44:15] &lt;Diddi&gt; the whole thing involves a new MIB, which (i think) i've added correctly into zenoss.. could it be related?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 23:29:35] &lt;Diddi&gt; werid thing is that only 7 of 8 oids are considered bad</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 23:29:43] &lt;Diddi&gt; why one is not, i have no idea</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 23:31:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; MIBs are only used for traps</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 23:31:18] &lt;Diddi&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 23:31:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; what version are you running?</span><br/><span> [26-Oct-2009 23:32:15] &lt;Diddi&gt; zenoss 2.4.5</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 00:00:46] [disconnected at Tue Oct 27 00:00:46 2009]</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 00:00:46] [connected at Tue Oct 27 00:00:46 2009]</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 00:00:56] [zenoss-logger (logger bot) has joined #zenoss]</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 03:44:37] MattD is now known as mdereus</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 05:20:11] &lt;tripitaka&gt; Hello,</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 05:20:21] &lt;tripitaka&gt; I have a device with two IPs, how can I monitor both of them?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 05:37:46] &lt;Apocalipse&gt; hi...</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 05:38:09] &lt;Apocalipse&gt; i am looking for zenpack foundry monitor...</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 05:38:18] &lt;Apocalipse&gt; where can i download it?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 05:38:27] &lt;Apocalipse&gt; i didnt find it...</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 05:39:53] &lt;Apocalipse&gt; ?</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 06:47:51] &lt;tripitaka&gt; Apocalipse: from </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2883.html">docs/DOC-2883</a><span> it looks like the foundry pack is enterprise only</span></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:13:23] &lt;cgibbons&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:15:28] &lt;ckrough&gt; ayup</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:39:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; morning</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:40:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 2.5 should be coming out today</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:40:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; w00t :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:41:05] &lt;cgibbons&gt; xfingers</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:41:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; any word from Egor on WMI Datasource?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:42:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; he is MIA</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:42:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; hasn't answered my ping either</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:42:53] &lt;cgibbons&gt; we'll probably wind up converting it ourselves</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:43:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; hopefully its not too much work</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:44:13] &lt;cgibbons&gt; it wouldn't be for me (I converted the 2 core windows daemons to the new collector framework) but for him it would be some learnin'</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:44:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; Would that new collector framework pretty much break any zenpack that has a collector plug-in?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:45:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; nope, not at all. it's opt-in only. it broke his because he made use of this common class that the 2 windows daemons used to use between themselves, but was rendered redundant so it was removed. thus the problem with not having an actual API the ZenPacks can use.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:45:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; Gotcha.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:46:16] &lt;cgibbons&gt; luckily it's a pretty easy conversion. i'd expect it would take me a full day tops.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:47:10] &lt;cgibbons&gt; if I get bored on my plane trips this week maybe I'll make some free time :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:47:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah i picked up a new book for my plane trips next week</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:47:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; mac osx unix: 101 byte-sized projects, perhaps i'll finally learn scripting</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:48:58] &lt;cgibbons&gt; nice!</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:49:07] &lt;cgibbons&gt; best way to learn something, do it. well for me anyway :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:49:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; well i figure i'm going to be there i'll have the laptop, might as well do something productive</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:49:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; usually i just bring my USB NES controller and play dr. mario</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:50:49] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i have a pretty hard time concentrating on planes, even for reading</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:55:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; ah well i don't on the plan itself, but i have a lot of downtime in the terminal</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 08:55:22] &lt;cgibbons&gt; brb room change</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:12:17] &lt;twm1010&gt; back in a bit, this laptop is getting nuked :|</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:48:20] &lt;cgibbons&gt; moisy</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:49:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, zenprocess on my busiest Zenoss server suddenly insists on going over cycle time every polling cycle, yet it has way less datapoints to poll than zenperfsnmp which is doing perfectly fine</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:53:49] &lt;cgibbons&gt; might be how big the process tables on the target devices are, or how the target devices compute those tables in the agent</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:54:39] &lt;cgibbons&gt; if you're using 2.4.5 zenprocess has a bunch of debug options from the command-line</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:55:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I think I'll check the log file for starters...</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:56:07] &lt;tripitaka&gt; My 2.4.5 zenprocess keeps dying with the following log error: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.pastebin.ca/1645204">http://www.pastebin.ca/1645204</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:56:44] &lt;tripitaka&gt; google tells me it's some kind of python error, nothing specific about zenoss</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:57:10] &lt;tripitaka&gt; any ideas on what could cause that?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:57:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have no idea, maybe cgibbons does</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:57:33] &lt;cgibbons&gt; dats a bug</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:57:43] &lt;cgibbons&gt; lemme see</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:57:54] kob is now known as kobalt</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:58:39] &lt;cgibbons&gt; looks like that is a bug in the debug log message at line 247 of zenprocess.py</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:59:11] &lt;cgibbons&gt; easy to fix if you wanna edit that file</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:59:24] &lt;tripitaka&gt; can do</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 09:59:39] &lt;cgibbons&gt; go to line 247 and change update.name to cfg.name</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:00:01] &lt;tripitaka&gt; done, restarting</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:01:28] &lt;cgibbons&gt; if you want to tickle that code, change a device somehow that's being monitored by zenprocess</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:02:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; bah, as if zenprocess doesn't support the "parallel" option</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:02:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; dinosaur of a daemon</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:04:05] &lt;tripitaka&gt; osprocess deleted and added on a host, and the process is still up</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:04:07] &lt;tripitaka&gt; thank you!</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:05:19] &lt;cgibbons&gt; cool!</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:05:29] &lt;cgibbons&gt; that shouldn't be in 2.5.0, that daemon got rewritten</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:05:52] &lt;tripitaka&gt; One more while we're at it - I've been looking for a way to monitor (ping) multiple IPs on a single device. is this possible?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:08:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; tripitaka: well, why wouldn't you just model the device so that Zenoss picks up on the interfaces and monitor the interfaces via SNMP?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:08:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; just as if not more reliable</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:08:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; or do you have multiple IPs bound to a single interface?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:08:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; in which case, why would you even care to ping all of them since you really only care about the physical interface itself when monitoring</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:10:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2494.html">docs/DOC-2494</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:10:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; That's a guide on setting up SNMP polling for interfaces</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:10:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; hello Matt</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:11:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; why hello doc-2494</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:11:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; except, this would almost have to be done per-interface</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:12:00] &lt;tripitaka&gt; interesting</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:12:32] &lt;twm1010&gt; i mean i could edit the standard template, but i also have plenty of servers that have multiple interfaces and some that aren't always on.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:13:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: hunh?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:13:21] &lt;tripitaka&gt; the situation I'm trying to resolve involves a router with multiple WAN interfaces. When a WAN link fails, the interface does not necessarily go down, as the switch it is connected to is still good. However the routing breaks such that I cannot ping the interface bound to that failed WAN link</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:13:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: it only applies to interfaces which you have actually set to be monitored</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:13:51] &lt;tripitaka&gt; so what I really need to do is to ping the loopback and interface addresses of the router</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:14:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; but aren't all interfaces not excluded automatically "monitored" ?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:14:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; tripitaka: yeh, so setup SNMP monitoring like I suggested</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:14:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; if a WAN interface fails it's operational status will be different than when it's ok</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:14:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; and Zenoss will pick up on it and alert on it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:14:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; Just set up the monitoring as outlined in the doc that I pasted</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:14:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; 'interface' != 'link'</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:14:52] &lt;tripitaka&gt; rmatte: the WAN interface stays up, it's operational status is fine, but a device a few hops away in the ISP's network has failed</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:15:04] &lt;tripitaka&gt; [router]----</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:15:05] &lt;tripitaka&gt; er</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:15:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; tripitaka: ah, I see what you're saying</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:15:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; so to detect issues in the cloud</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:15:38] &lt;tripitaka&gt; ----eth0[router]eth1-------[switchA]------(ISP)-------[zenoss server]</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:15:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; tripitaka: just add additional devices with those IPs and name them something slightly different the monitor them for ping only</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:15:58] &lt;tripitaka&gt; if the ISP fails, I can no longer ping eth1 on the router</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:16:20] &lt;tripitaka&gt; rmatte: I have tried that, but I get 'a device with this IP already exists'</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:16:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; tripitaka: yeh, if you've modeled the device and the interfaces are attached to it it won't be possible</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:16:52] &lt;tripitaka&gt; when it discovers the host it finds all its IPs, and if there is a conflict with an existing host it will die</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:16:55] &lt;tripitaka&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:17:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; tripitaka: there's really no way around that since that's the intended design...</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:17:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; What happens if you add them as non-snmp devices first</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:17:55] &lt;tripitaka&gt; no way to add an IP address service, or similar?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:17:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; tripitaka: I thought there was a way to enable ping monitoring for interfaces but I could be wrong</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:18:14] &lt;tripitaka&gt; that would be great</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:18:20] &lt;tripitaka&gt; can't see one though</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:18:25] &lt;tripitaka&gt; feature request?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:18:33] &lt;kobalt&gt; there is</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:18:37] &lt;twm1010&gt; could you not use the nagio check_ping in a perf template?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:19:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: actually, yeh, you could</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:19:03] &lt;tripitaka&gt; twm1010: good idea</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:19:07] &lt;kobalt&gt; from the device go to os, then choose the interface you dont want to monitor then click the down arrow, choose monitoring</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:19:07] &lt;tripitaka&gt; kobalt: how?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:19:13] &lt;kobalt&gt; then disable</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:19:37] &lt;kobalt&gt; when you choose the interface I mean the check box</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:19:41] &lt;kobalt&gt; not the link</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:20:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: ummm, I don't think you understand his question fully</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:20:06] &lt;kobalt&gt; if you have a lot of interfaces there is a zendmd script to use</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:20:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: he's asking how to monitor interfaces via ping and snmp simultaneously</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:20:31] &lt;tripitaka&gt; the interface itself stays up during these events</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:20:40] &lt;kobalt&gt; oh hehe</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:20:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; tripitaka: from what I can see, the check_ping script is your only option</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:20:52] &lt;tripitaka&gt; in fact, the only notification I get is from zenoss, complaining that the bandwidth on the backup link has exceeded a threshold :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:20:55] &lt;kobalt&gt; sorry I read disable monitoring on the interface sorry</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:20:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; tripitaka: based on an old thread: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://74.125.93.132/search?q=cache:LuDPBCGTeQcJ:forums.zenoss.com/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D6834%26view%3Dprevious%26sid%3D4692400474d0489b334df5c0df510de5+ping+monitoring+interfaces+zenoss&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca">http://74.125.93.132/search?q=cache:LuDPBCGTeQcJ:forums.zenoss.com/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D6834%26view%3Dprevious%26sid%3D4692400474d0489b334df5c0df510de5+ping+monitoring+interfaces+zenoss&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:20:59] &lt;kobalt&gt; its early</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:21:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; tripitaka: also, you probably want to setup the snmp status monitoring anyways, it's really effective and useful</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:24:54] &lt;tripitaka&gt; looks like a mixture of check_ping amd DOC-2494 is the way to go</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:25:11] &lt;tripitaka&gt; thank you both</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:27:44] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: so yeah I fixed the node issue hehe, it was still in the collectors</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:27:53] &lt;kobalt&gt; I have not added that node back yet tho</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:29:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:30:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; would be nice if that little zendmd blurb was available as a button somewhere in the collectors section of Zenoss</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 10:30:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've seen that issue pop up a few times</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:02:41] &lt;cgibbons&gt; hurm</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:07:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; Who's the expert on unit-testing zenpacks?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:12:33] * mrayzenoss looks at the developers&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; cgibbons and zenethian</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:17:08] &lt;cgibbons&gt; que?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:19:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; davetoo wants to write unit tests!</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:20:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; For (at least) one of the enterprise zenpacks</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:20:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; Trying to get solaris 2.8 ssh monitoring going</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:21:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; but the options for the runtests command seem to have changed a lot</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:22:33] &lt;davetoo&gt; one question is whether the rest of the test infrastrucuture exists in the release rpms</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:24:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; bbiaf</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:26:02] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yeah it does</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:26:20] &lt;cgibbons&gt; QA even uses it as part of their artifact testing</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 11:43:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-4423.html">docs/DOC-4423</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:03:19] &lt;mdereus&gt; Am I the only noob here that's watching the Getting Started webcast?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:03:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hate how when you run a python script and redirect output to a file, like ./myscript.py &gt; file.txt it doesn't write the output to the file until the python script terminates</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:04:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's annoying when you want to capture output and watch the output simultaneously</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:04:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; You have to do some lower-level tricks to make the ouput unbuffered, I think</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:04:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; bleh</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:10:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm so publicly releasing this script when I'm done with it, it could easily be modified to do anything</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:10:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; (The ticket create daemon that I'm writing)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:10:29] &lt;davetoo&gt; heh</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:10:36] &lt;chemist&gt; rmatte: will it work with RT?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:10:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; Finally have a nice quiet day to work on it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:10:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; RT?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:11:14] &lt;jb&gt; the most well known open source ticket system? :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:11:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; chemist: all it's doing is calling on a perl script which one of my coworkers wrote which actually creates the tickets...</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:11:42] &lt;chemist&gt; sounds like it will work with rt :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:12:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; I thought OTRS was the most well known open source ticketing system</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:15:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; OTRS is what we're using and it's quite good</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:15:52] &lt;chemist&gt; RT is pretty good too</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:15:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; then again we had to modify it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:16:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; we did quite a few custom mods to it to get it to how we wanted it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:16:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; RT looks nice but it's not really the style of ticketing that we needed</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:17:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; we based our modifications to OTRS on a Remedy based system that we use as well</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:17:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; The Remedy based system is owned by a different company (The company that I worked for 3 years ago), the company got liquidated so we support their contracts and they just run the servers.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:26:32] * twm1010 sees 2.5.0 for download :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:26:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; the beta, yeh</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:47:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; Question does the nsloopup in zenoss only do a nslookup or does it do a host file look?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:49:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: it works with hosts files</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:50:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: we pretty much only use hosts files</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:50:11] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: hrmm</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:50:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: and I have the hosts files automatically update every hour based on the Zenoss device inventory</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:50:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if a device gets renamed or something, or the IP changes, the hosts file is always up to date</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:51:13] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: I have serveral networks that are static NAT'd behind routers so the ip we manage and the ip of the device may not be the same</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:51:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:51:44] &lt;kobalt&gt; so for instance I have a device with a 10.10.10.1 address but the devices actuall address is 172.25.1.2</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:52:12] &lt;kobalt&gt; I can ping and access it with the 10. address but I get traps from the 172 address</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:52:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, there's no real way of setting it as 172.25.1.2 in Zenoss and having Zenoss monitor 10.10.10.1</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:52:29] &lt;kobalt&gt; how do I get zenoss to see that</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:52:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd have to add it as a comment on the device page</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:52:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; manually</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:52:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; because as far as Zenoss can see, the device is in fact 10.10.10.1</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:53:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; since it can hit that, but can't hit 172.25.1.2</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:53:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; currenly I have HP openview, and what it does is when it gets a trap from the 172 it looks in the host file and sees that address is hostname</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:53:34] &lt;kobalt&gt; so I have 2 entrys for the same host name in the host file</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:53:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: oh, I see, I'm not sure if Zenoss is that intelligent, you'd have to test it to see</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:54:05] &lt;kobalt&gt; because host files are read top down, my 10. address is first then the 172 address is next</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:54:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; it might work, you need to test it, but that would only be for traps</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:54:53] &lt;kobalt&gt; right I would status ping and poll from the other address</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:55:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; right</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:55:11] &lt;kobalt&gt; most of these networks are trap and status polling</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:55:24] &lt;kobalt&gt; I would not be doing snmp graphing etc</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:55:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; wouldn't the trap look like it's coming from 10.10.10.1 though?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:55:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; NATing generally works both ways does it not?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:56:00] &lt;kobalt&gt; you would think but its not working that way for some reason</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:56:41] &lt;kobalt&gt; I am getting traps from the devices currently as their native ip</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:57:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmmm, they must be sending the IP as part of the trap</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:57:19] &lt;kobalt&gt; and have the host file setup on the server</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:57:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, I'm not sure if Zenoss is coded to do that</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:57:43] &lt;kobalt&gt; let me make sure I have the host file in the right place</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:57:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; test it, and if it's not you could open a trac feature request</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:58:38] &lt;kobalt&gt; looks like I do, its /etc/hosts</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:59:34] &lt;kobalt&gt; I wonder if I add the device as 10. and then make the host file only read the 172</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 12:59:43] &lt;kobalt&gt; will it cause conflicts</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:02:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; the hosts file takes priority over dns</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:02:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; so probably</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:04:49] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok Im going to test this hehe, adding a device by name lets see which ip it picks up</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:07:24] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok it picked it up as the 10 (which makes sense cause its the first ip)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:10:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:10:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can manually change the IP though</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:11:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; then send test traps and see if it picks up on the fact that they relate to that device</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:14:24] &lt;kobalt&gt; thats the fun part</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:14:44] &lt;kobalt&gt; they are not my network, its a customers netowrk hehe</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:16:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:16:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; you don't have access to them somehow?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:16:46] &lt;kobalt&gt; I do</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:17:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; login and send a test trap somehow</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:17:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:32:56] &lt;kobalt&gt; well so far so good it seems I am getting traps from it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:34:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 13:36:32] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yippie!</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:10:36] &lt;mdereus&gt; mrayzenoss: Thanks for the webcast today.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:11:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I was a little rushed, trying to get 2.5 out</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2.5 RC2?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; or final?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; final</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, is it out today?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; like as in right now?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we're still working on a few things</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, you can find it on SF</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; a suggestion then</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; update the channel topic</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:12:55] &lt;mdereus&gt; haha</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:13:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that's in the queue of things to fix</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:13:15] &lt;rmatte&gt;

But what if I could tie a template to that particular process</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:43:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; __jd__: we have almost 100 windows servers monitored on one of our Zenoss boxes via pure SNMP, so we just added the processes that we wanted to monitor to the list and remodeled everything</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:43:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; __jd__: there already is a template tied to processes by default</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:43:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; to collect CPU and memory usage for the process</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:43:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; __jd__: you could make a local copy of that template and then modify it for a specific process</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:43:57] &lt;__jd__&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:44:05] &lt;__jd__&gt; that sounds perfect :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:44:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to the process on the device that you want</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:44:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; then go to the Template tab</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:44:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; then click the "Create local copy" button</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:44:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; then click on the template</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:44:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; and do whatever you want with it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:44:59] &lt;__jd__&gt; very nice</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:45:22] &lt;__jd__&gt; I think I must have been looking at Services instead before.. didn't notice this :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:45:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could also create templates higher up in the tree and just bind them to whatever you want</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:45:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:45:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, services doesn't have a template by default</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:45:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; from what I can remember anyways</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:45:55] &lt;__jd__&gt; can you just bind the template to /Processes/memcached, for example?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:46:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I'm not a fan of WMI monitoring anyways so I barely ever use services</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:46:03] &lt;__jd__&gt; and anything that has memcached gets it?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:46:16] &lt;__jd__&gt; well I guess I meant IpServices :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:46:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; __jd__: nah, it would be more of a per process thing</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:46:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; per process per device</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:47:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; hopefully they make the template system more powerful in the future</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:47:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; it is a bit limited at the moment</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:47:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; makes things that should be dead simple quite tedious in some cases</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:47:40] &lt;__jd__&gt; it has a lot of potential for sure</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:47:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; but overall it's not that bad</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:48:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's better than anything else that I've personally seen</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:50:10] &lt;__jd__&gt; yea.. I think a lot of it is basically relying on zope's inheritance model.. so I think that limits it a bit</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:51:00] &lt;__jd__&gt; I'd like to be able to put templates everywhere :).. Like, why not under /Locations, for example? :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:51:39] &lt;__jd__&gt; maybe devices in the remote datacenter have different response time thresholds, etc.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:52:05] &lt;__jd__&gt; right now, I just emulate that under with organizers..</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:52:19] &lt;__jd__&gt; under Devices, rather</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:53:29] &lt;__jd__&gt; It's on the right track though I think..&#160; I worked with some of the ZenOSS founders at USi in Annapolis where they built USi's monitoring system.&#160; And it was pretty slick to say the least :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:53:42] &lt;l2huynh&gt; if anyone can give me some pointers, how do I configure zenoss to use a backup internet connection to send email alerts if the primary connection goes down?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:54:08] &lt;__jd__&gt; I still have a friend who works there..&#160; USi was bought by AT&amp;T now and they're replacing the whole monitoring infrastructure with AT&amp;T's telco-focused garbage</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:54:37] &lt;__jd__&gt; l2huynh, I think you would do that at the OS level</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:55:34] &lt;l2huynh&gt; so the switch over would be seamless to zenoss?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:56:15] &lt;kobalt&gt; by using metrics on your routes in the server</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:57:00] &lt;kobalt&gt; have your primary connection set to a metric 1 and your backup to metric 2 the OS will move to the 2nd route if the perfered route is down</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:57:15] &lt;kobalt&gt; or like 10 and 20 on the metrics</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 14:57:53] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I understand, my concern if it make any differences to zenoss once the switch over occurs?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:03:00] &lt;kobalt&gt; zenoss probably would not see it, unless you have it monitoring that route specificly</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:05:48] &lt;l2huynh&gt; my main objective is to get alert sent out</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:08:01] &lt;kobalt&gt; you could have it ping the next hop ip as a dummy device and then if it cant get to it, generate a alert</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:08:20] &lt;kobalt&gt; if your next hop ip is pingable</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:08:56] &lt;l2huynh&gt; right, and will zenoss be able to send alert out through the back up connection or will it just keep sending out the primary connection and get lost?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:09:36] &lt;kobalt&gt; well if its trying to send out a alert it will just send, its the OS who decides how to get out then the routing table will send it out</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:10:26] &lt;kobalt&gt; zenoss does not nessarly know that is the route out, it just says hey its down, send alert, the OS says ok I cant get to that one so Ill go out the backup</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:10:38] &lt;kobalt&gt; does that make sense</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:11:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you need to configure the routes correctly on the linux box itself</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:12:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenoss doesn't bind to a specific interface</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:12:17] &lt;l2huynh&gt; well, that's a relief</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:12:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; (to my knowledge)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:12:46] &lt;l2huynh&gt; thanks guys</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:13:05] &lt;kobalt&gt; no it just goes with the OS, I have 3 interfaces on mine, I have shut interfaces down and Zenoss dont care</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:13:11] &lt;l2huynh&gt; make matter much more simpler this</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:13:18] &lt;l2huynh&gt; way</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:13:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:14:45] &lt;l2huynh&gt; now asking for recommendation, I'm moving away from vm appliance, kindda leaning towards suse, is it a good choice?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:15:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: we use Ubuntu here and it's been great</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:15:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; Ubuntu Server edition</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:15:15] &lt;kobalt&gt; I run centos 5 but Im a rh/fedora guy</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:15:45] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I see,</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:15:49] &lt;kobalt&gt; Im also trying my hand at freeBSD.... may not be the best hehe</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:16:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have 11 Zenoss Core boxes running on Ubuntu and haven't really had any problems with them.&#160; Installs and upgrades via the stack installer have been flawless.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:16:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; wow</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:16:38] &lt;l2huynh&gt; the reason I'm moving away from vm appliance is that now I keep getting heartbeat failure and could not figure out why</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:16:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's really up to your personal preference though</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:17:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: well, that is probably just because the VM doesn't have adequate resources to properly run Zenoss</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:17:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: Zenoss isn't the most lightweight piece of software, but then again doing monitoring in general is quite intensive</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:18:46] &lt;l2huynh&gt; do you see any advantage of moving away from vm?</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:18:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: install it on a machine with adequate resources and you may also be interested in some of these tweaks: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2521.html">docs/DOC-2521</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:19:22] &lt;l2huynh&gt; great, thanks</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:19:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: well, we run all of our Zenoss boxes in VMs, but they run on ESX on blade servers that have 15GHz of processing power with 32 gigs of ram in each, so they are more than adequate</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:19:42] &lt;l2huynh&gt; right,</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:19:58] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I have 1 gig ram for VM, maybe that's the problem</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:20:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; l2huynh: If you're just going to be using it for 1 installation to monitor internal stuff you might as well put it on it's own dedicated box with like 4 gigs of ram and 3GHz of processing or something</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:20:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, 1 gig is definitely not enough</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:20:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; all of my VMs have a minimum of 2</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:20:28] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I see,</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:20:34] &lt;l2huynh&gt; well, thanks for the inputs</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:20:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; one of them has 5 gigs (but I'm monitoring like 380 devices on it)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:20:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I could get away with 4 on that one though</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:21:03] &lt;l2huynh&gt; i'm just monitoring 40 devices</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:21:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; the extra gig is just overkill because when we get a flood of events Zenoss kicks off like 380 ticket create scripts at once (to create tickets in our ticketing system) and drowns the box</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:21:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm actually working on a ticket create daemon right now which will eliminate that problem</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:21:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; at which point we'll bring the box back down to 4 gigs</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:21:53] &lt;l2huynh&gt; that's great</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:22:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; for 40 devices you can get away with 2 gigs of ram and some decent processing power</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:22:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, what types of devices?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:22:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; mostly servers?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:22:32] &lt;l2huynh&gt; mostly cisco</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:22:35] &lt;l2huynh&gt; routers</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:22:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, then yeh, you can definitely get away with 2 gigs</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:22:50] &lt;l2huynh&gt; we have about 10 servers, but just ping is fine</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:22:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; server monitoring is much more intensive than monitoring routers and switches</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:23:15] &lt;l2huynh&gt; well, thanks rmatte,</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:23:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd recommend at least 2GHz of processing power as well</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:23:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; no problem</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:23:26] &lt;l2huynh&gt; I feel better</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:23:45] &lt;l2huynh&gt; keep beating myself for all these heartbeat failure</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:24:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; l2huynh: sorry to jump in late, RHEL/CentOS is the most tested platform FYI</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:24:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:24:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; l2huynh: Ubuntu is probably the most popular</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:24:27] &lt;cgibbons&gt; matt: whatever bug you're talking about now is a p3.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:24:31] &lt;l2huynh&gt; ohh, I see</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:24:34] &lt;l2huynh&gt; thanks ray</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:41:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; and you would do that on your e-mail server, not the zenoss server</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:42:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; wee, scrolling issue</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:42:07] &lt;twm1010&gt; i'm 2 hours late to that party</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:44:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:44:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was wondering what the heck he was talking about</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:50:59] &lt;kobalt&gt; well here goes nothing, just started 2.5 build on FreeBSD</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:51:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; woot, think we finally got the ticket create script that my daemon calls on debugged, now to create over 1000 tickets to test it...</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:51:31] &lt;cgibbons&gt; nice</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:51:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; the regex that we were using in it didn't like [], {}, (), _, and some other stuff</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:52:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; so some of the tickets were failing to be created</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:53:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just wish my lab box were faster, this is going to take forever</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:53:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh well</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:54:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; the script isn't really designed for an event queue with over 1000 events in it lol</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:54:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; it reads the whole queue on each ticket create</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:54:35] &lt;kobalt&gt; oh run</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:54:41] &lt;kobalt&gt; s/run/fun</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:54:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:54:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's still not too bad, takes like 5 to 10 seconds per ticket</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:55:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; it takes a lot less when the queue is smaller</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 15:55:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; the ticket create script that I'm calling on is really the bottle neck</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:00:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.com/trac/ticket/5659#comment:3">http://dev.zenoss.com/trac/ticket/5659#comment:3</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:07:17] &lt;majikman&gt; i keep getting a lot of these in my event.log file. are they normal? INFO ZODB.Conflict database conflict error (oid 0x2d, class Products.ZenUtils.PObjectCache.PObjectCache) at /zport/RenderServer/render (11443 conflicts, of which 3 were unresolved, since startup at Tue Oct 20 01:51:28 2009</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:10:30] &lt;majikman&gt; also... i had some errors that popped up in my event log so i put my servers into maintenance mode. now that they're back up, i took them out of maintenance mode but the clear for those events never seem to come through. is that expected?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:14:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: push changes to your collector</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:15:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: the collector probably still sees them as being in maintenance mode</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:15:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: click on Devices on the left</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:15:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; then go to Manage -&gt; Push Changes</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:15:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; that should hopefully resolve your issue</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:15:33] &lt;majikman&gt; ah, thanks. trying that now</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:15:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:16:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should work but let me know if it doesn't</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:20:18] &lt;majikman&gt; still nothing yet....</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:20:49] &lt;majikman&gt; btw, when am i supposed to push changes?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:20:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; what kinds of events are they?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:20:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; ping?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:21:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; any time you make a config change that you want the collector to pick up on right away</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:21:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; the collector only comes back to Zenoss to update configs automatically every hour</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:21:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if you remodel a device to pick up new interfaces for instance, you would want to push changes so that the collector knows to monitor those interfaces immediately</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:21:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; or if you remove an interface, or a process, or anything</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:22:00] &lt;majikman&gt; oic, thanks</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:22:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:22:12] &lt;majikman&gt; this is from the zenmodeler /Cmd/Fail Connection was refused by other side: 111: Connection refused.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:22:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:23:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; that came from zenmodeler though, not sure if it'll actually clear until it attempts to model the devices again</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:23:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you probably have it set as the default, which is 6 hours between models</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:23:38] &lt;majikman&gt; oh...</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:23:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could do "zenmodeler run" as the zenoss user to force it to run through a modeling cycle</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:23:43] &lt;mdereus&gt; rmatte: confirmed I did the stack install, had to refresh my memory on what I did</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:23:43] &lt;majikman&gt; yea, i left it at default</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:23:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; "zenmodeler run -v10" if you want to see more details while it's modeling</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:24:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; mdereus: ah ok, then your upgrade will be very easy, you just download the newer stack installer and run it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:24:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; mdereus: then hit enter at the 2 prompts to accept the settings and off it goes</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:24:34] &lt;mdereus&gt; just downloaded it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:25:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I generally stop zenoss before running it, but it should do that automatically before installing</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:25:27] &lt;mdereus&gt; following the installation documentation</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:26:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; mdereus: yeh, the installation documentation instructs you to back stuff up beforehand which is a good idea.&#160; I never do that since all my Zenoss boxes are VMs so I just take snapshots of each before upgrading so that I can just revert back if anything screws up</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:26:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; I haven't had anything screw up on an upgrade yet though</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:26:53] &lt;mdereus&gt; yeah, I have Ubuntu running on a VM</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:27:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; then just snapshot it if you can</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:27:11] &lt;mdereus&gt; I could do that, but I'm not offended by having to learn more command line linux</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:27:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; easier than doing the backup</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:27:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:27:36] &lt;mdereus&gt; awww, a command line install progress bar, how cute</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:27:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just more of a pain if you have to restore from backup</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:27:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; easier to just revert to the snapshot and have everything magically work again</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:28:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, just a heads up, the progress bar will stop at 100% for a while, don't kill the installer or anything, it is actually doing something</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:28:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; ;)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:28:51] &lt;cgibbons&gt; bbialw</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:29:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; is a little while less than a bit?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:29:11] &lt;mdereus&gt; haha, that's where it's at right now</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:29:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it'll eventually finish, just give it some time :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:29:34] &lt;mdereus&gt; I looked at a different screen, looked back at putty and it was stopped, kind of panicked</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:29:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:33:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; brutal, one of our clients has some virus infestation at one of their locations, a lot of their workstations are doing a DDoS on google.com :P</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:33:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's going to be a big cleanup</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:37:57] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; good luck taking down google</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:38:02] &lt;mdereus&gt; 2.5 up and running, looks sweet</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:38:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe, I doubt the google servers are even breathing hard</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:38:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; mdereus: good stuff</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:38:38] &lt;mdereus&gt; I wish everything was that easy and painless.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:38:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup, the stack installer is awesome</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:39:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss1: you guys should get a stack installer made for FreeBSD :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:40:17] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; you know I think they make one</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:40:27] &lt;mrayzenoss1&gt; and a Solaris one as well</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:40:33] &lt;mdereus&gt; I hate comparing Zenoss with Nagios (as it's the only other thing I've experienced) but setting up and configuring Nagios is like trying to single handedly construct the Titanic.</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:40:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; they could have it detects and correct all the little problems (like syslogd settings and stuff) with the user's permission of course</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:40:51] &lt;kobalt&gt; hehe well im installing it from source right now</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:41:00] mrayzenoss1 is now known as mrayzenoss</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:41:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; mdereus: yeh, Nagios is very brutal to setup</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:41:36] &lt;majikman&gt; rmatte, i ran the remodel and it processed one of the servers that has an event still but that event didn't go away</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:41:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; majikman: events don't go away</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:41:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: quite honestly, just move the events to history manually, it won't hurt it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:42:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: it was a command failed event from zenmodel, generally you'd expect it to auto-clear if zenmodel were run again successfully</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:42:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, an argument could be made for that&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; ticket :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:42:55] &lt;majikman&gt; yea, what rmatte said</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:43:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, just move them to history by hand</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:43:12] &lt;majikman&gt; mrayzenoss, are you saying i should submit a bug?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:43:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; please don't submit bugs, we already have enough, bug reports are always nice though :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:43:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it seems that modeling should be a very black &amp; white issue</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:43:49] &lt;kobalt&gt; lmao</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:44:00] &lt;kobalt&gt; @rmatte</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:44:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; if you can't model something, you probably have to fix something, it shouldn't just magically get better</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:44:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:44:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so why bother with a clear event?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:44:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you know you're going to have to fix it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:46:02] &lt;majikman&gt; mrayzenoss, i've already fixed it but the event isn't automatically clearing</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:46:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, it won't</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:46:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you have to move it to history&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; or wait 4 hours</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:46:33] &lt;majikman&gt; why wait 4 hours?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:47:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; under Event Manager-&gt; Event Aging Threshold (hours)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:47:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:47:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; events that don't duplicate clear out after 4 hours</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:47:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; some events auto-clear, some don't, apparently that's one of the ones that doesn't clear</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:47:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; snmp traps are another example of events that will never clear themselves</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:47:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; or syslogs</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:48:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can always go and map a Clear event for them</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:48:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; you know, that's one thing I've never done is mapped a clear event, think I'll work on learning that tomorrow since I really should know it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:48:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've mastered every other aspect of event manipulation :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:48:38] &lt;majikman&gt; ok. i'm going to wait 4 hours just to make sure i don't have an issue wiht my installation</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:49:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it'll be in the Event History after 4 hours if it hasn't had a duplicate come in</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:49:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: hehe, all waiting 4 hours is going to do is have the system auto move the event to history</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:49:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's the exact same as moving it to history by hand</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:49:35] &lt;majikman&gt; cool. well, technically, the last time the event occrued was 3 days ago....</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:49:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, but what's the event count on it?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:49:54] &lt;majikman&gt; 1</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:50:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, then just move it to history</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:50:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; the issue is resolved otherwise you'd have a higher event count</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:50:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the last time would be recent</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:50:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; majikman: the "Last Seen" is 3 days ago?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:50:45] &lt;majikman&gt; mrayzenoss, the name of my column is lastTime</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:51:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ahh.. in 2.5 it's been updated to "Last Seen" :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:51:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, if the lastTime is from 3 days ago and the event count is only 1 then just move it to history</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:51:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not setup to clear itself</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:51:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; only thresholds, ping events, and process events are configured to auto-clear themselves by default</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:51:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, and snmp agent down events</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:52:14] &lt;majikman&gt; sweet.... 2.5 has been released</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:52:26] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, we're polishing the release notes</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:52:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; everything else will stay there indefinitely unless you manually move it to history or have automatic event aging setup</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:52:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; and even with automatic event aging, it will never clear critical events (it's a bug/oversight in the design of the auto-aging system)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:53:26] &lt;majikman&gt; oic</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:53:30] &lt;majikman&gt; interesting to know</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:53:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: If you're using Zenoss for production I'd highly advise waiting until like 2.5.3 before upgrading to it lol</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:53:43] &lt;majikman&gt; haha, ok</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:53:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: it still has several annoying bugs/nuances that haven't been fixed yet</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:54:44] &lt;majikman&gt; i also have an issue with zenoss having issues with connecting to the snmpd server on the machines being monitored and amongst my 50 or 60 some odd boxes, zenoss is sending me well over 200 mails a day</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:54:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: you guys should post a list of patches for 2.4.5 somewhere since stock 2.4.5 is quite buggy until like 4 patches are applied to it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:55:17] &lt;majikman&gt; buggy? what bugs?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:55:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, what kinds of problems?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:55:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: command based alert event counts not incrementing, not being able to set device model info manually, stuff like that</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:56:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: I'll see if I can get a list for you...</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:56:46] &lt;kobalt&gt; I would like that also</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:57:11] &lt;kobalt&gt; or point me to where to find the info hehe</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:57:15] &lt;majikman&gt; oh... the mails i'm getting is zenoss saying it can't connect to the snmp agent, then that it can't read from the process table. then anywhere from 1 to about 10 minutes later, it will say process table up and snmp up</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:57:16] &lt;__jd__&gt; l2huynh, /me too</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:57:16] &lt;__jd__&gt; err</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:57:16] * __jd__ too</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:57:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/query?status=assigned&amp;status=backlog&amp;status=closed&amp;status=new&amp;status=verification&amp;group=patch_state&amp;patch=2.4.5&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=priority&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=component&amp;col=changetime&amp;report=6&amp;order=status">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/query?status=assigned&amp;status=backlog&amp;status=closed&amp;status=new&amp;status=verification&amp;group=patch_state&amp;patch=2.4.5&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=priority&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=component&amp;col=changetime&amp;report=6&amp;order=status</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:57:56] &lt;majikman&gt;

hmm&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; maybe I can follow up with QA to add a report of "Accepted 2.4.6 patches"</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:59:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: that sounds like more connectivity issues on your part</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 16:59:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; here it is: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/query?status=assigned&amp;status=backlog&amp;status=closed&amp;status=new&amp;status=verification&amp;group=patch_state&amp;patch=2.4.6&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=priority&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=component&amp;col=changetime&amp;report=6&amp;order=status#no2">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/query?status=assigned&amp;status=backlog&amp;status=closed&amp;status=new&amp;status=verification&amp;group=patch_state&amp;patch=2.4.6&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=priority&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=component&amp;col=changetime&amp;report=6&amp;order=status#no2</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:00:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 2.4.6 proposed</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:01:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: the other 2 patches you want are 15003 and 14397</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:02:13] &lt;majikman&gt; rmatte, thats what i thought too so i waited until one of those events would pop up and tried to snmpwalk that server and it worked fine. in fact, the servers are only 1 hop away</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:02:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ok, sent a note to our QA manager about making a permanent report for un-released but accepted 2.4.X patches</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:03:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: would be nice</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:03:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; since it's very unlikely there will be a 2.4.6</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:03:23] &lt;majikman&gt; how do i see what time the zen snmp walker is scheduled to execute at and which log file does it log errors into?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:03:26] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we're also looking into adding the Voting module in Trac, so you can vote on tickets</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:03:38] &lt;majikman&gt; mrayzenoss, that'd be an awesome addition to Tra</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:03:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I recommend that any 2.4.5 users run this command as the Zenoss user: zenpatch 15003 &amp;&amp; zenpatch 14397 &amp;&amp; zenpatch 15214</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:03:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; then restart Zenoss</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:04:21] &lt;majikman&gt; oh wow... thats all it takes to patch an installation of zenoss?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:04:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: what kind of box are you running Zenoss on?&#160; How much memory and CPU power?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:04:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: yessir, zenpatch is god</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:05:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; majikman: yeah, zenpatch goes to Subversion and gets the patches.&#160; The next release will roll them up</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:05:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so as long as your patches are pulled from the right branch, you're good to go</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:05:33] &lt;majikman&gt; rmatte, dual quad core xeon with 16 gigs of ram</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:05:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: I suggest you do some of the tweaks listed here: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2521.html">docs/DOC-2521</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:05:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; it will dramatically improve performance</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:06:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; especially on such a beefy box</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:06:06] &lt;majikman&gt; ahh... thanks</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:06:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:06:49] &lt;majikman&gt; crap, i probably should have backed up before i patched. i'm getting this now when i try to run /etc/init.d/zenoss start </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m262614e6">http://pastebin.com/m262614e6</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:06:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hey rmatte, why don't you start a wiki article of post-2.4.5 updates, listing your recommendations?&#160; That way there'll be a page people can be pointed to if they choose to stick with 2.4.X for awhile</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:07:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: I could just post it on my blog if that's ok?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:07:47] &lt;majikman&gt; whats your blog url?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:07:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; (my Zenoss community blog that is)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:07:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that's fine, I like the wiki idea because other people can update it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:08:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you could put it on the wiki&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; then blog about it :p</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:08:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:08:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and then start a discussion thread for maximum karma</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:08:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../blogs/ryanmatte.html">blogs/ryanmatte</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:08:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a bit bare since I just started it recently</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:09:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll add a wiki page and blog about it as you suggested :P</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:09:34] &lt;majikman&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:10:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: any suggestion for a title?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:10:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: "Post-2.4.5 Patches"?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:10:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that sounds fine, I'll find excuses to send people towards it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:11:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:11:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you could mention in the wiki that WMI Data Source isn't updated and doesn't work with 2.5</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:13:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; Ok, I'll make another page for that after</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:13:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; That should really be mentioned on that ZenPack's page Matt</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:13:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it could go on that same page, as a reason for sticking with 2.4.5</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:13:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe you could add a big bold disclaimer at the top of the page?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:14:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: you can do it, it's a Community page</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:14:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I'll add the disclaimer in to this wiki document</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:14:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, I shall</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:20:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3392.html">docs/DOC-3392</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:20:46] &lt;rmatte&gt;

mrayzenoss: it trashed my King Crab install, I had to reinstall King Crab</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:24:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; fair enough</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:24:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: had tons of errors afterwards, couldn't even use the zenpack command, so couldn't remove the pack, it was brutal</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:27:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, Jive is so tempermental, I went back to correct my wiki entry (since it apparently didn't like the code tag entry) and it totally trashed the formatting on me</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:27:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; stick with the HTML view</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:28:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; html view is blank</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:28:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the abc view is screwed</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:28:39] &lt;rmatte&gt;

oh my god, now I'm getting a "This document needs some content" error when I try to publish the updated page</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:32:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; even though there is freaking content</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:32:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; grrrrr</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:33:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; does egor do IRC?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:33:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I haven't seen him in weeks</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:33:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; he used to be on a fair amount but he's been quite busy recently</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:33:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; now it's not allowing me to backspace the content</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:34:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, this is really frustrating</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:34:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should not be this difficult to update a wiki page</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:35:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, I had to swap over to the html view and back to be able to edit</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:35:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; then swap over and back to publish</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:35:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; weird</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:36:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; and now it's working fine</span><br/><span><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:37:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-4434.html">docs/DOC-4434</a></span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:37:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; voila</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:38:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:38:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; bookmarked :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:38:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; how about a bit of text describing the bugs so we don't have to follow the links ?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:38:57] &lt;majikman&gt; am i correct in saying that zenoss has syslog functionality much like syslog-ng?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:38:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: it's a wiki, go for it :P</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:39:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: correct</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:39:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: zensyslog is the daemon that handles it</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:39:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; I wouldn't say "much like syslog-ng"</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:39:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a syslog daemon, but it's certainly not configured in the same way as syslog-ng</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:39:55] &lt;majikman&gt; well... i can pull syslog entries from other servers into a central location and categorize the events based on severity?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:40:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can actually have syslog-ng in between the devices and Zenoss</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:40:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:40:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; we have one box with syslog-ng in between, it forwards off all of the security syslogs to a file, and sends the rest to Zenoss</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:40:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; majikman: my advice is to use a central syslog-ng server as a pre-filter</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:40:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; because processing syslog events in zenoss is rather "expensive"</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:40:43] &lt;majikman&gt; ahh... then have zenoss pull from the syslog-ng server?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:40:48] &lt;majikman&gt; oic</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:40:54] &lt;majikman&gt; is there a tutorial on how to set that up?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:40:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; You should get rid of all the known-benight noise</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:40:59] &lt;majikman&gt; or is there a zenpack for it?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:41:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, have syslog-ng actually forward the desired events on to Zenoss</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:41:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; benignt</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:41:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; arg</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:41:12] &lt;majikman&gt; benign?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:41:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure about a tutorial, definitely not a zenpack</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:41:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; benign</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:41:16] &lt;majikman&gt; haha</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:41:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; benighted</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:41:33] &lt;majikman&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:42:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; you basically just change the syslog port of zensyslog (which is a quick config change in zensyslog.conf), then configure syslog-ng (which is not Zenoss related, but there's plenty of documentation out there on configuring syslog-ng)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:42:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; you just need to add a line to zensyslog.conf: syslogport&#160;&#160; 5514</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:42:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; then configure syslog-ng to forward whatever events to that port</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:42:55] &lt;davetoo&gt; Does that actually work correctly now? :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:42:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's not absolutely necessary</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:43:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; It didn't used to</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:43:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; if the syslog load is fairly light Zenoss is more than capable of being tuned to drop or change events using event transforms</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:43:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: yeh it does not</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:43:32] &lt;majikman&gt; well, my zenoss box is pretty beefy so i'm going to run the centralized syslog system on the same box. if i do that, is there still a point in using syslog-ng?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:43:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: used to have to actually change it in the source code</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:43:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; does now*</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:43:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; majikman: ease of configuration</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:44:10] &lt;davetoo&gt; you'll have to go through hundreds of pointy-clicky steps in zenoss to configure it to drop known noise</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:44:12] &lt;majikman&gt; davetoo, are you saying that using syslog-ng will provide me ease of configuration?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:44:17] &lt;majikman&gt; oh ok</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:44:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: well, let's put it this way, are you going to have security devices sending thousands of syslogs to the server per second, or are you just having the odd device syslogs coming in from routers, switches, and servers?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:44:19] &lt;majikman&gt; cool, thanks</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:44:33] &lt;majikman&gt; rmatte, probably thousands</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:44:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; then with the non-noise, you do event mappings and maybe transforms</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:44:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: thousands per second?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:45:02] &lt;majikman&gt; well, maybe not thousands per seconds. but definitely more than the odd device syslogs</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:45:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenoss can be set to only accept syslogs above a certain severity, so that can filter out a lot of the noise</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:45:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you just use transforms for the rest</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:45:24] &lt;majikman&gt; what i would like to do is get apache to log php errors into syslog and forward those to a centralized sys log servers so my php developers can see errors in tehir code</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:45:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; but if it's absolutely ridiculous how many events are coming in then you'll need to resort to using syslog-ng to perform filtering</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:45:56] &lt;majikman&gt; ok, i'm going to use syslog-ng</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:46:00] &lt;majikman&gt; thanks for the advice</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:46:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: why don't you just have a separate syslog-ng server setup just for that purpose?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:46:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: that doesn't strike me as something that needs to be stored in Zenoss</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:47:03] &lt;majikman&gt; rmatte, well thats just one of the reasons i want syslogging</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:47:10] &lt;majikman&gt; of course, i'd like to still see the syslog form the servers</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:47:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; I understand that, but your syslog solution will obviously depend on how much noise you have coming in</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:47:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it's a lot then you definitely want syslog-ng filtering</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:47:54] &lt;majikman&gt; right...</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:47:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; If we had all the security syslogs flooding in to Zenoss it would probably destroy it lol</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:48:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; it certainly would make it useless as a monitoring solution</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:48:11] &lt;majikman&gt; but from what you guys are saying, zenoss doesn't seem to have the capability to do good filtering</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:48:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; since the event console would be flooded with crap</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:48:37] &lt;majikman&gt; so i don't want to use zenoss for syslog so i'm goign to use syslog-ng and just forward important stuff to zenoss</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:48:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss can do filtering fine, it's more of a performance thing</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:48:44] &lt;majikman&gt; and keep the other stuff in syslo-gng</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:48:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; syslog-ng is specifically designed to be absolutely hammered with syslogs</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:48:54] &lt;majikman&gt; rmatte, sounds to me like it doens't do it fine then :)</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:49:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss doesn't perform quite as well under that kind of load</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:49:12] &lt;majikman&gt; exactly... thats why i'm going to use syslog-ng</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:49:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: eugh, you're totally not getting what I'm saying</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:49:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I've heard 10K/minute is our cap</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:49:41] &lt;majikman&gt; ok... what are you saying?</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:49:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, syslog-ng can handle like 100k per minute, so it's obviously better suited for filtering really really noise networks</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:50:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; s/noise/noisy</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:50:28] &lt;majikman&gt; right, i understand that</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:50:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm just saying that zenoss has the functions to filter just fine, but it's not going to be able to handle getting absolutely pounded by syslog messages</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:51:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you were getting like 5000 syslog messages a minute and wanted to filter out all the crap, Zenoss could do it, you'd just need to configure it properly</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:52:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; it really depends on how many syslog messages are going to be coming in per minute</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:53:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; when I said "does it fine" I was referring to the ability to filter messages, I wasn't referring to the performance of it being hit with hundreds of thousands of messages per minute</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:53:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; it all depends on the load</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:53:19] &lt;majikman&gt; i understand where you're coming from. my thought is this... i don't want to use zenoss only to find out that i'm getting more syslog messages than i thought or if i need to grow, i'm goign to have major growing pains. so instead, i'm just going to start with syslog-ng</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:54:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, if you think you're going to have heavy load now or down the road that's the best approach to take</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:55:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; later all, look for the blog post tonight</span><br/><span> [27-Oct-2009 17:55:44] &lt;rmatte&gt;

when the Event Class Key is set to defaultmapping on a mapping Zenoss will attempt to apply the mapping against any event that ends up in /Unknown (as they generally have a blank event class key)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:17:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; any questions?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:17:19] &lt;nickanderson&gt; mmm im sure</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:18:36] &lt;suprsonic&gt; any ideas on my issue?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:19:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; mrchippy1 and jp are looking through the mib processing code</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:19:21] &lt;suprsonic&gt; sweet</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:19:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's most likely some bug, I've seen that behaviour before</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:22:07] &lt;nickanderson&gt; so either I must be misunderstanding something or I shouldnt do what I wanted to do</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:22:33] &lt;nickanderson&gt; I dont know all the possible traps this LOM might send and where they might get mapped in event classes</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:22:58] &lt;nickanderson&gt; I dont want to go to all these classes and do specific ip transforms</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:23:11] &lt;nickanderson&gt; that seems like highly duplicated effort</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:23:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; nickanderson: oh, I see what you mean, hmmm</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:23:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, try the transform in /Events and see if it works</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:23:38] &lt;nickanderson&gt; nada</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:23:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:23:44] &lt;nickanderson&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:23:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what I thought, but always worth a try</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:24:08] &lt;nickanderson&gt; I also tried just adding the ip of the LOM in the OS interfaces of the "parent" device</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:24:11] &lt;nickanderson&gt; nada</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:24:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, it won't set the IP based on interfaces</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:24:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; only device IPs</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:25:09] &lt;nickanderson&gt; so there is no great way to "merge" two devices?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:25:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; what if you add a hosts file entry with that IP and the hostname of the device?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:25:25] &lt;nickanderson&gt; that seems unmaintainable</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:25:27] &lt;nickanderson&gt; mmm</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:25:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe Zenoss will pick up on the fact that the IP resolves to that device name</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:25:35] &lt;nickanderson&gt; oh maybe im an idiot</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:25:43] &lt;nickanderson&gt; I shouldnt trap directly to zenoss</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:25:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:25:48] &lt;nickanderson&gt; I should trap to the host</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:25:52] &lt;nickanderson&gt; and have it fwd</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:26:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that would be ideal</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:26:02] &lt;nickanderson&gt; eh?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:26:09] * nickanderson slaps himself</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:26:11] &lt;nickanderson&gt; thanks rmatte</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:26:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:26:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:26:59] &lt;Aziraphale&gt; doesn't that miss the point of an ILO card?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:27:13] &lt;Aziraphale&gt; if the host has to work for the traps to arrive?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:27:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; man, I went to see Law Abiding Citizen 2 days ago, frigging amazing movie</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:27:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; go see it people</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:27:27] &lt;Aziraphale&gt; sounds boring ;)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:27:43] &lt;nickanderson&gt; Aziraphale, slightly but I have monitors on the host anyway</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:27:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; Aziraphale: nah, it's action packed lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:27:58] &lt;kisielk&gt; what CMS is being used for the new Zenoss community/</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:28:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

Aziraphale: I will get notified by zenoss when the host is down, from the LOM im interested in Hardware status like pwrsply failure</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:28:26] &lt;mrchippy1&gt; suprsonic: can you go into zendmd and type the following: dmd.Mibs.oid2name( '1.3.6.1.4.1.674.10893.1.20.200.0.901', True, False )</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:28:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; Aziraphale: you certainly don't need an ILO card to tell you when a host is down :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:29:08] &lt;Aziraphale&gt; rmatte: well, you might want to know *why* ;)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:29:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; Aziraphale: that's what ILO logs are for</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:29:26] &lt;NauTiluS1&gt; hi</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:29:30] &lt;suprsonic&gt; k</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:29:31] &lt;Aziraphale&gt;

so any trap received gets associated with that device</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:33:23] &lt;suprsonic&gt; mrchippy1 returns '', would you like me to sent the trap again?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:33:47] &lt;mrchippy1&gt;

i went to /events/unknown and it showed the other transform i wrote as inherited</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:38:18] &lt;nickanderson&gt; thats good to know</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:38:39] &lt;mrchippy1&gt;

I skipped the one in '/usr/local/zenoss/zenoss/lib/python/Products'.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:43:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know it's harmless</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:43:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; but can I just delete one of those directories to fix it?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:43:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; (I think it's because the location of Five changed during a previous update but it never removed the old location</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:44:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; it happens on new systems too</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:44:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; (I think)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:44:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it didn't happen on a fresh install of King Crab</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:44:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it only started happening after my update from 2.3.3 to 2.4.1</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:44:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; yeah, the Zope stuff got moved to $ZENHOME/lib/something....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:45:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so the one in $ZENHOME/Products is most likely the obsolete one</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:46:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; only for 2.5</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:46:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, going to try something...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:46:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; how can it be only for 2.5?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:46:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; (I wonder if the migration cleans that up)_</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:46:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; this is on a 2.4.5 box</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:46:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; the zope library move to $ZENHOME/lib/....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:46:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; I think..</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:47:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; of course, I've been running on insufficient sleep for a couple of weeks :)&#160; So I could be mistaken about the sequence of versions on my development system.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:49:37] &lt;venturaville&gt; I'm playing with a fusion I/O card behind zenoss</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:49:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; what is that?</span><br/><span><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:50:09] &lt;venturaville&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.fusionio.com/Products.aspx">http://www.fusionio.com/Products.aspx</a></span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:50:17] &lt;venturaville&gt;

I'm comparing it to SAN, and so far it doesn't look like it does much for RRD storage (jury is still out)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:51:18] &lt;venturaville&gt; but the GUI is much snappier</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:51:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; if you could fit all of your RRD files...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:51:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:51:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; venturaville: based on experience?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:51:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; or by specs?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:51:45] &lt;davetoo&gt; who's on the jury? :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:51:47] &lt;venturaville&gt; looking at in graphs</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:52:02] &lt;venturaville&gt; the GUI is subjective, but myself and one other person</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:52:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; Good *n*x support?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:52:41] &lt;venturaville&gt; I'm using the HP drivers for it, and they seem to work without a hitch</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:52:45] &lt;venturaville&gt;

How big is your zenoss system(s)?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:55:25] &lt;venturaville&gt; (100K data points)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:56:39] &lt;bigegor&gt; Sorry. I'm was VERY busy last 2 month.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:56:58] &lt;venturaville&gt; the slow points still seem to be the hub and the events from mysql</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:57:11] &lt;twm1010&gt; Understandable :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:57:40] &lt;bigegor&gt; New WMIDataSource with zenoss 2.5 now in SVN and need some testing</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:58:12] &lt;mdereus&gt; yay bigegor</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:58:25] &lt;venturaville&gt; any chance this version has support for WMI proxies......</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:58:58] &lt;twm1010&gt; woot!</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:59:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; will gladly test for you Egor!</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 11:59:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; let me update my beta to 2.5 and Ill get right on it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:00:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; so if Rusty told us that WMI performance monitoring doesn't work very well, was that due to issues on the Zenoss side?&#160; Or Windows?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:00:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; mrayzenoss: will my 2.5Beta5 upgrade to 2.5prod?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:00:13] * davetoo doesn't know jack about WMI </span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:00:15] &lt;bigegor&gt; not now i have only rewrite zenperfwmi daemon for ZenCollector infrastructure</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:00:58] &lt;venturaville&gt; k</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:00:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; Ah, well I'll be ready to test when you are.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:01:29] &lt;venturaville&gt; oh wait this is WMI data source not WBEM</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:01:38] &lt;venturaville&gt; (they get mixed up in my head)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:01:45] &lt;bigegor&gt; WMI</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:02:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; bigegor: comment about WMI performance monitoring?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:03:30] &lt;bigegor&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:03:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; was just things that needed improving in Zenoss?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:03:44] &lt;jb&gt; hey egor</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:03:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; wow, he is alive</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:03:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; hey egor</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:03:52] &lt;bigegor&gt; hey</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:04:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; Rusty told us in training that WMI was good for modeling, not so good for performance monitoring.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:04:17] &lt;jb&gt; why?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:04:23] &lt;jb&gt; WMI works fine for performance monitoring</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:04:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: it works fine for performance monitoring, provided that it stays stable on the actual server's side</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:04:33] &lt;jb&gt; and its necessary in many cases</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:04:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've noticed that the WMI service fails a lot</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:04:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; it can get quite annoying</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:04:50] &lt;jb&gt; mine don't ever fail..</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:04:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; jb: rmatte is dead on, i've seen WMI lock up alot, and it can take quite a bit of other stuff with it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:05:14] &lt;twm1010&gt; especially on older/WIN2K stuff, but i've seen it mess up some 2003 boxes too</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:05:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; jb: then you've either tuned it to perfection or you're lucky, I've used it to monitor a small number of servers in the past and constantly had problems</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:05:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: I've seen it tends to affect systems with lots of mismatches and such, SNMP informant can suffer from the same affliction.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:05:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's fairly rock solid on server 2003</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:05:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; on server 2008 it's a nightmare though</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:06:01] &lt;jb&gt; its usually SNMP on windows boxes that&#160; messes up before WMI</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:06:06] &lt;jb&gt; i dont monitor any 2000 boxes though</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:06:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: I don't use snmp informant, just plain jane Windows SNMP service, works nicely</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:06:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm using WMI to monitor 16 to monitor servers at our e-commerce hosting facility and it's rock solid, but those servers were very tightly built</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:06:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: although I had to write scripts to collect the CPU and memory usage info since it reports it in the stupidest way possible</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:07:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; but other than that it works great</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:07:04] &lt;bigegor&gt;

I would like to drop the source tree for it somewhere...suggestions for where?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:13:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:13:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: Yeah... I'm in the same boat, about every 9 months I try and entertain the management on getting Enterprise</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:14:23] &lt;venturaville&gt; we just switched to it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:14:33] &lt;venturaville&gt; on the whole it was probably worth the money</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:14:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: Yeh, we don't have the cash to pay for it, it wouldn't be cost effective since it would almost cost as much as we're charging the actual clients for the monitoring service</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:14:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; well we have this shiny new NOC in India</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:14:49] &lt;davetoo&gt; and a team of guys to watch the monitor</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:15:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; We're running three monitoring systems right now.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:15:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; venturaville: well yeh, the support alone is worth the coin</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:15:05] &lt;davetoo&gt; so it was time.&#160; We have five sites, ten "core" systems.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:15:10] &lt;twm1010&gt; Hobbit, SolarWinds, and Zenoss</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:15:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I setup my 11th core server 2 days ago lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:15:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll eventually be up to over 20</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:15:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; well I'm much, much happier with the daemon stability in 2.4.x</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:15:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; zenperfsnmp no longer sucks goat's a**</span><br/><span><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:16:35] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I've yet to update to 2.4.5, I'm on 2.4.2</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:16:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; unfortunately zenprocess still sucks horribly</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:16:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:17:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; I can't predict how zenprocess will behave, if I have to match against parameters (java and zope/zenoss itself )</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:17:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; plus, I have *seen* the process table time out regularly on busy machines.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:17:36] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, perhaps i will step us up to 2.4.5 with those patches</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:17:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; well yeh, the regex handling is definitely broken</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:17:41] &lt;davetoo&gt; snmpd just doesn't get the cycles.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:17:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; but performance-wise, it's bad too</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:17:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's the only daemon that constantly goes over cycle time on one of my boxes</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:19:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; How do you determine ideal cycle time?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:19:09] &lt;twm1010&gt;

as long as I don't get "waiting for next cycle..." anymore I'm happy</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:20:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: tinypic.com</span><br/><span><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:20:27] &lt;twm1010&gt;

is that one of your beast servers with the 16GB of ram you mentioned?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:26:07] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; rmatte: In Case upgrade from 2.4.5 with installed ZenPack WMIDataSource to 2.5, would it be crashing King Crab?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:26:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a VM with 5GB of ram assigned to it on a blade that has 32GB of ram in it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:26:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; Troubadix09: I haven't tested that, but I would advise against it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:26:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; Troubadix09: VERY likely.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:26:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; Troubadix09: I'll be sure to test that out when I have a second</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:26:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; Troubadix09: I'm almost positive that it would though</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:27:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: the cycle times are also long because I'm monitoring devices all over the place on that box</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:27:49] &lt;Troubadix09&gt;

I only have 1 zenoss box which actually monitors our local stuff</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:28:15] &lt;twm1010&gt; Troubadix09: So you already upgraded to 2.5, or an upgrade to 2.4.5 caused your problems?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:28:34] &lt;twm1010&gt;

Troubadix09: your Zenoss install is totally trashed now</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:31:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; are ALL the daemons stopped?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:32:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: it doesn't matter, even if he gets all of the daemons running he won't be able to use the zenpack command</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:32:18] &lt;twm1010&gt; zenpacks can be installed via cmd line why not removed?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:32:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll error out when he tries to use it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:32:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:32:26] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; twm1010: yes, all are stopped, only the zope-deamons running</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:32:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: I tried everything to fix it after installing the pack on my 2.5 test box and I couldn't fix it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:32:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I eventually just had to completely reinstall</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:33:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; Troubadix09: If rmatte got stumped, and he's pretty determined... then you're probably screwed.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:33:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:33:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; i wonder is the conflict in the zope database or in the code or both?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:33:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; I actually may take some time tonight, install it again on my test box, and see if I can figure it out, but it was extremely brutal the last time I tried</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:33:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; Could he overwrite most of the zenoss files and leave the database alone?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:34:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're basically handcuffed since some daemons won't start and the zenpack command errors</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:34:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; zendmd is screwed too</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:34:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; as far as I can remember</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:34:11] &lt;twm1010&gt; doh!</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:34:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; bummer...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:34:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:35:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; So, even if Egor updates... I'll probably have to remove WMI datasource, all the other performance zenpacks that rely on it, and all custom templates i've created that use it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:35:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; I put a huge disclaimer at the top of that ZenPack's page not to install it on 2.5 lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:35:15] &lt;twm1010&gt; then upgrade, then put it all back.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:35:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yeh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:35:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; jinkies, thats a shit-ton of work</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:35:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: well, you might be able to do a straight update on 2.4.5 then upgrade</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:35:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; it depends how he codes the pack</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:36:17] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; rmatte: thats not right, you warn to install it on 2.5 but in my case it was installed on 2.4.5</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:36:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: but you certainly won't want to be updating until there's some sort of fix</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:36:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; Troubadix09: I warn not to install it because I assume that the only reason that you'd be visiting the ZenPack page is to install it :P</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:37:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; Troubadix09: I'll update it to include warnings about updating as well</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:37:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; It would be slick if Zenoss would refuse upgrades if there are known conflicts with installed zenpacks</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:37:46] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; rmatte: for me it is to late ... lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:38:32] &lt;twm1010&gt; sounds like my upgrade path might be a little rocky</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:38:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; I guess its time for me to build a true development system</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:39:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yeh, I have a lab box setup and it's great to have</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:39:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: actually I have 2 setup right now, 1 with 2.4.5 and one with king crab</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:39:54] &lt;twm1010&gt; I could swear there was a recorded zenoss demonstration that mrayzenoss built</span><br/><span><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:41:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; voila: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3392.html">docs/DOC-3392</a></span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:41:13] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; rmatte: One Question ... I'm on VMware appliance, can I recover, when i start a fresh VMWare appliance with zenoss 2.4.5 and restore a complete backup?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:41:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; updated</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:41:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I'll update my wiki page as well</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:41:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; Troubadix09: restore from what backup?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:41:49] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; rmatte: well done ;-)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:42:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; Yes, you probably can do that</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:42:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, my wiki page already has the correct wording, so we're good</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:42:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; Might I recommend from now on when doing upgrades to leverage the Snapshot feature :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:42:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, snapshot is HIGHLY recommended</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:43:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a great advantage of using a VM, so use it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:43:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, back to logging this change ticket...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:45:48] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; rmatte: yes, next time I use it ... :-)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:47:16] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; twm1010, rmatte: thanks for help, I'm leaving now</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 12:47:43] &lt;Troubadix09&gt;

lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:06:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm pretty sure he means jumping into code</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:06:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:06:57] &lt;twm1010&gt; looking at that is interesting though, you see he does mention in there where the cycle times come from</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:06:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not THAT good at python yet, so I'll have to pass</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:07:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:07:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I just meant someone could build the ZenPack and test it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:08:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:09:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'll build it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:10:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'll attach it to the ZenPack page and label it "BETA"</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:10:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; ok, i'm game to test it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:11:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; off to the brick-and-mortar office</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:12:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; done</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:12:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I'll test it once it's built</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:13:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's up</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:13:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, I just need to finish what I'm working on then I'll get started on that</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:14:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; mrayzenoss: we also need to figure out an upgrade path for existing users</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:14:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; we were discussing that before</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:14:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, our lab ESX hosts is soooo slow it's brutal</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:14:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; twm1010: good point</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:14:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yeh, I'll test an upgrade</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:14:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: since I have a lab box that I can do it on</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:15:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'll see if it can be installed against 2.4.5 before an upgrade</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:15:17] &lt;twm1010&gt; A guy was in here earlier and saw that upgrading to 2.5 with the old one installed fried his install</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:15:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; if I remove the 2.5 dependency</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:15:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, saw that</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:15:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yeh, which I predicted would happen</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:15:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; then he's like "well you didn't say anything about upgrading"</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:15:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; still&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; we need an upgrade path</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:15:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; I thought that was implied</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:15:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:16:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; can anybody say publically here when 2.5.0 Enterprise is expected to be posted?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:16:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; nobody will say it publicly :p</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:16:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; or /msg me directly :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:17:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; loaded to Stack 2.5 without issue</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:17:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; on SLES10</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:18:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; adding the exchange pack too</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:18:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; stop and start zenoss</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:18:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; and do a zenpack --list</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:18:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; for starters</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:18:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; davetoo: I'm getting nothing but gibberish</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:18:55] &lt;cgibbons&gt; I expect it will be posted before 2011!</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:20:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; in fact let me test WMI performance too</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:24:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; bah, got disconnected from our crappy lab ESX host during a change and can't get connected to the vmware console again</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:25:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; K, just waiting for 3-4 collector cycles</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:26:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; no debug evts yet</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:28:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; woops, since i didn't restart zenoss, zenperfwmi wans't running yet</span><br/><span><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:29:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

</span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.pastebin.org/49326">http://www.pastebin.org/49326</a></span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:33:14] &lt;zenethian&gt; that is pretty hardcore.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:34:03] &lt;cgibbons&gt; did you restart zenhub?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:34:38] &lt;cgibbons&gt; (the hub service didn't provide all the data the daemon is looking for, so that's usually the culprit)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:36:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; at first no, then I restarted the entire stack</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:44:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll be testing out the actual upgrade process going from the old pack to the new one and from 2.4.5 to 2.5 in a few minutes</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:49:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; curious to see if you can get the new pack to work at all</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:50:01] &lt;cgibbons&gt; when you patched did you get all teh files in the changeset, twm?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:51:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; I used a fresh 2.5 install, with the build that Matt posted just now.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:51:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm installing 2.4.5 on my king crab box right now...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:52:03] &lt;cgibbons&gt; ah he built it i see, wonder if he got all the files</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:52:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I just did a svn update to grab the latest and built it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:52:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; didn't test it, we're all assuming egor was done</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:52:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; hehe "_</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:52:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:52:44] &lt;cgibbons&gt; if you look @ the WmiPerfConfig.py file and look @ line 98, it should say proxy.namespace = namespace</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:54:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; I have that here</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:54:53] &lt;cgibbons&gt; weird, should be good then, assuming zenhub really got restarted. that's from just eyeballing the code though, i haven't tried it either.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:55:19] &lt;cgibbons&gt; and on that note, my airplane is here so hasta</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:55:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:58:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, finished installing 2.4.5, going to install the old zenpack...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:59:14] &lt;mrchippy&gt; suprsonic: i just send myself a trap using snmptrap and the correct oid made it through to the event</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:59:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; perhaps you'll fair better, but i'll feel better if you get the same issue</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 13:59:43] &lt;mrchippy&gt; suprsonic: what version zenoss are you running?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:00:19] &lt;rmatte&gt;

k</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:19:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; restartin.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:19:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool, I never even knew about tac</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:19:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; that could actually come in quite handy</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:20:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; I restarted zenoss again, started fine yet again</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:21:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; still no joy here.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:21:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; k, will uninstall stack, remove zenoss, reinstall, and try again</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:21:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: I'm curious, what if you configure Zenoss not to monitor any device via WMI</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:21:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; then try to start it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:21:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe it's actually choking on the cycles</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:21:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; mine has no devices to cycle for right now</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:21:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, good thought, let me axe the one device i setup</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:22:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:22:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; nope</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:22:56] &lt;rmatte&gt;

ok, so that was a fresh install of the beta pack on a fresh 2.5 instance?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:24:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; no, it was an upgraded beta 2.5 to 2.5 prod instance</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:24:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; thats why i want to axe it and start over</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:24:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; won't take too long</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:24:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, axe everything and start over</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:24:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it works on a fresh install then it's good, since I've already proven that it'll work with an upgrade</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:25:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:25:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't have any WMI devices though, so when you get it working if you could test the actual monitoring that'd be good</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:25:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; i will, i have all the eggs extracted and ready</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:25:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:25:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; and when i try this on prod you can bet i'm gonna shut down and backup the entire stack :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:25:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hate having to unzip eggs</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:26:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; they really really need to fix that Jive issue</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:26:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I take snapshots on my prod boxes before doing anything to them</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:26:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; snapshots are awesome, such a time saver</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:26:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; yeah, my prod boxes isn't a VM though so...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:26:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:27:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; a copy of the stack directory should do the trick</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:27:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; well it damn well should be :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:27:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:27:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; eh, our ESX servers are... shall we say... overloaded</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:27:37] &lt;twm1010&gt; none of them are SAN attached, disk I/O bloat all over</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:27:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe, sounds like our lab ESX box</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:27:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; we desperately need a second lab box</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:27:57] &lt;twm1010&gt; my test box is just a desktop</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:28:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm confused on our direction lately, we've got this big push to "consolidate" servers right</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:28:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; but at the same time a mandate to keep certain things separate</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:28:48] &lt;rmatte&gt;

yeah... i mean, we're moving from old netware boxes that do everything</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:30:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; to lots of windows boxes each doing one thing</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:30:54] &lt;twm1010&gt; im confused how that can be considered "consolidating"</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:31:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's such a waste</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:31:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I guess these are these are the kinds of people who don't like it when their food touches</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:31:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:32:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; ignore the second "these are" accidentally pasted it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:32:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:37:15] &lt;kmtsun&gt; are there any online resources you guys know of... that covers how to add MIBs to zenoss?&#160; I'm trying to add on for my PDU's</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:37:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; kmtsun: the Zenoss Admin Guide</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:37:49] &lt;kmtsun&gt;

it's a writeup that I did in regards to installing Cisco Mibs in Zenoss</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:39:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll be basically following the same process, so give it a read</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:41:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: how's the install coming along?</span><br/><span><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:43:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; The writeup is also available here: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://demonic.cc/?p=20">http://demonic.cc/?p=20</a></span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:44:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: works fine on new install :D</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:44:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: sweet deal</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:44:47] &lt;mdereus&gt; rmatte: is demonic.cc your personal site?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:44:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; hey egor, we just got done testing your pack, perfect timing</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:44:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; mdereus: yes it is</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:45:05] &lt;bigegor&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:45:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; so, anybody here authenticating against AD instead of LDAP?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:45:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; we tested it on a fresh install of 2.5 and it worked fine</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:45:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; I installed 2.4.5, installed the old pack, upgraded to the new pack, and then upgraded to Zenoss 2.5 and it worked as well</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:45:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; so upgrading will be simple enough</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:45:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: could you test the actual monitoring real quick?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:47:54] &lt;bigegor&gt; WMIDataSource 2.0 doesn't support WMI name spaces other then root/cimv2 for now.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:48:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:48:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; did 1.0 support more than that?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:48:39] &lt;bigegor&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:48:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:48:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, let us know when you add the support and we'll test again</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:48:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: kinda busy</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:49:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you're off to a good start</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:49:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: ok, that's cool</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:50:55] &lt;kmtsun&gt; thanks rmatte... very good resource</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:51:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; kmtsun: no problem</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:52:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: authenticating against AD with Core is basically impossible</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:52:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; got enterprise</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:52:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; impossible?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:52:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; i got it to work</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:52:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't even know how possible it is in enterprise lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:52:49] &lt;davetoo&gt; we'll find out</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:52:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: really?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:53:04] &lt;davetoo&gt; The basic authentication is a standard Zope product</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:53:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I spent like 4 hours one day walking a guy through all sorts of different things to try and it never worked</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:53:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: yeh I know, Zope plugins</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:53:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: we use LDAP for authentication</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:53:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; Our so-called "Enterprise" corp IT ldap system is garbage</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:53:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:54:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; we just use openldap</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:54:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; works perfectly</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:54:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; one system is missing a good percentage of the users, and the other one which *was* working</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:54:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; suddenly has some kind of new data that makes the zope roleManager blow up</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:55:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; so I'm going to try the AD servers that our group runs :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:55:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:55:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; figuring out the LDAP stuff for Zenoss was tricky at first</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:57:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; Nice, my LDAP guide on this thread got slaughtered</span><br/><span><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:57:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../message/30127.html#30127#30127">message/30127#30127</a></span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:57:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; think I'll post it properly on my Zenoss blog</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:57:37] &lt;zenethian&gt; j #zope</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:57:39] &lt;zenethian&gt; grr</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:57:47] &lt;zenethian&gt; slash fail. :&lt;</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:57:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; missing a slash in there</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:57:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:58:12] &lt;kobalt&gt; so if I do a upgrade from 2.4.5 to 2.5 will I have to redo my templates? or anything like that, I can see there were issues with the wmi but I dont use the wmi portion</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 14:58:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; Did they actually create a working migration so that an "upgrade" is possible?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:00:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: you managed to get role mappings working in AD too?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:00:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; &lt;CamargoBP&gt; You have to manually add a user to a role, can't map roles to AD</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:00:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; &lt;CamargoBP&gt; I spent weeks trying to get it working</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:00:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; &lt;CamargoBP&gt; Works with openldap but not AD</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:00:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; &lt;CamargoBP&gt; I don't know why</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:00:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's from an old chat</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:01:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; rmatte: not exactly</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:01:11] &lt;davetoo&gt; not mapping from any ldap data,</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:01:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: we heavily depend on roles, so that would be a no go for us lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:01:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; I just used that plugin to pre-cache role assignments for users</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:01:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh, we just don't have anything useful in LDAP to do it with</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:01:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:01:56] &lt;davetoo&gt; I dunno, maybe I can figure out a way to do it by manager or cost-center number.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:02:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; We *were* going to start running our own ldap service just for things like this, in particular for network gear,</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:02:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; but I think that project fell apart.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:03:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:03:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../thread/8820%3Fstart=15&amp;tstart=0.html">thread/8820?start=15&amp;tstart=0</a></span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:03:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; ocnam explains the fix for the role assignment in that thread</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:03:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; I should do some screencaps.&#160; The reason I do this trick is that I tried setting the default user level to ZenOperator, but that's a real-time binding.&#160; You cannot downgrade somebody.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:04:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; so I went back to ZenUser, and then I go into the roleManager via the ZMI, where you can search ldap for a user,</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:04:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; and then add them to the cache with a particular role.&#160; That way I don't have to do the, lame-IMO, "log in first, then log out and call me and I'll finish setting up your account" game.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:04:44] &lt;davetoo&gt;

heh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:16:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; see :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:16:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:17:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; 8 months ago, time flies</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:18:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; Back then I knew less than half of what I know about Zenoss now :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:18:17] &lt;majikman&gt; so i'[m still having a problem with my zenoss installation reporting that it can't read the process list on the device. after doing some poking around, it seems that i need to turn up the timeout it uses on snmpwalk. however, i don't know how to set that in zenoss. can someone help me with that?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:18:36] &lt;davetoo&gt; rmatte: me too</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:18:43] &lt;davetoo&gt; and about 5% of the python I know now</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:18:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: it doesn't use snmpwalk first off, it uses an snmp python library</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:19:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: same, my python skills are improving quite a bit</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:19:26] &lt;majikman&gt; oh... ok. do you know what file its in? or do you know a string i can grep for?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:19:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: Collectors -&gt; localhost -&gt; Edit (tab)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:20:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh wait nevermind, that's the interval</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:20:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; the timeout is actually in zProperties</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:20:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to the zProperties for the device and increase zSnmpTimeout</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's in seconds, 15 by default</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:01] &lt;majikman&gt; sweet, thanks</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; crank it up to like 30 or 60</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:12] &lt;majikman&gt; 15? mines is 2.5</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:22] &lt;majikman&gt; are you looking at ConnectTimeout or Timeout?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; nevermind, I actually increased mine to 15</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:43] &lt;majikman&gt; lol ok cool</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I monitor across slow links, need the extra time</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; I need to customize the login page</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; but I can't find it in zope</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:21:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; I found the normal css</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:22:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: well, obviously all you need to customize is the image, so just search for images, there can't be that many lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:22:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; Not sure that it's "obvious"</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:22:35] &lt;davetoo&gt; I need to add some text</span><br/><span><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:22:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://armour01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/acl_users/cookieAuthHelper/zenoss-login.png">http://armour01.novanoc.com:8180/zport/acl_users/cookieAuthHelper/zenoss-login.png</a></span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:22:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; but, yeah, that's a unique file so that should be a good 'handle'</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:23:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can't add the text to the image?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:23:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; sure</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:23:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; once I figure out how the template works :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:23:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:23:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; 8180?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:23:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I use 8180 on my servers instead of 8080</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:24:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:24:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; we run ZipTie on 8080</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:24:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh sheesh that whole thing is an image</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:24:23] &lt;davetoo&gt; not great</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:24:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh it is lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:24:41] &lt;davetoo&gt; but I have The Gimp:)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:24:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: testing collection now</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:24:43] &lt;davetoo&gt; and even Photoshop</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:24:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm sure the gimp is more sufficient for adding text :P</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:25:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; more than sufficient rather</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:25:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: cool</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:25:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; need to add our logo too, and get the transparency right.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:25:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; but I think I may need to add a bunch of real text, silly legal disclaimer crap.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:25:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:26:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; Well, there's not a heck of a lot of room to add stuff</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:27:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; on the logo on the top left? yeah, its small</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:27:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; found that out :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:27:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; right, but that's only one of several &lt;div&gt;s</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:27:13] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok meeting time</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:27:17] &lt;twm1010&gt; the only way to make room is to make the "zenoss" smaller</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:27:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: he's talking about the login screen</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:27:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: its working, all the graphs show NAN, expecting information shortly</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:27:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: good</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:28:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; "WMIDataSource 2.0 doesn't support WMI name spaces other then root/cimv2 for now"</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:28:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm no WMI expert, what kind of stuff will it not currently be able to collect?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:29:02] &lt;twm1010&gt; neither am i, all i know is that everything i need is generally under there</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:29:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:29:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's probably other trees for stuff like Exchange and IIS</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:29:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh, my calendar is wrong</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:29:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; s/trees/name spaces</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:29:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:30:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; "You mean it's not Friday!?^!&amp;&amp;*%!"</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:30:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; ahh... no, they're under root/cimv2 as well</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:30:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: ah, then I don't see what the issue is lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:31:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; ok, so our upgrade test from 2.4.x was... update WMI datasource, effectively breaking it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:31:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; then upgrade to 2.5, right?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:32:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:32:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; so anyone upgrading to 2.5 will need to update the pack right before upgrading</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:33:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd wait until the formal non-beta pack comes out before hitting prod equipment with it though</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:33:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; and there's some stuff in 2.5 that I refuse to upgrade until it's fixed</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:34:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; sigh... service desk people...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:34:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:34:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; so impatient</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:34:30] &lt;twm1010&gt; "what do you mean it will take a while to restore 2TB of data?"</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:34:57] &lt;folke&gt; twm1010, lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:35:36] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: graphs looking good</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:35:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; i'd say it works fine</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:35:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; good stuff</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:36:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yeh, I love that</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:36:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: I don't think they realize exactly how much data that is :P</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:36:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; 2TB?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:36:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; my favorite as of late "why do you need this from tape backup?" "it wasn't in snapshot."</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:37:04] &lt;davetoo&gt; hah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:37:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:37:17] &lt;folke&gt; hrhr. thats nice :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:37:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; while I navigate to the Netapp in question "You mean like this snapshot from yesterday I'm staring at that has it right now?"</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:37:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; hah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:37:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; gotta love it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:37:56] &lt;folke&gt; aouch 20% snaps that holds 2TB.. pretty big volume :&#229;</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:38:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; The one that grew so much that it filled your quota, because you deleted so much stuff trying to reclaim your quota space? :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:38:04] &lt;majikman&gt; is there anyway to extend the length of the event console? i want to put it on a screen that is going to have a much higher vertical resolution and i'd like the event console to extend down as far as possible</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:38:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; davetoo: nah the 2TB is for something else</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:38:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; but our NetApp volumes are pretty big, nothing smaller than 2TB</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:38:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; we keep them under 4TB because our model filers have a limit for A-SIS dedupe at 4TB</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:38:48] &lt;twm1010&gt; we haven't turned it on yet though</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:39:04] &lt;folke&gt; Ah, we have a-sis limit on 2TB</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:39:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: have you not noticed that it auto-sizes?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:41:01] &lt;majikman&gt; oh... it always seems to leave some white space at the bottom of the screen</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:41:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; trust me, it auto-sizes</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:41:20] &lt;majikman&gt; i figure i could get at least 1 or 2 more events to list in there</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:41:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; it won't be an issue</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:41:25] &lt;majikman&gt; ok, thanks</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:41:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:45:58] &lt;majikman&gt; wow, is it it me or does snmpd runVERY slowly sometimes?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:46:04] &lt;majikman&gt; its taking up 100% cpu usage on one of my servers</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:48:50] &lt;mloven&gt; hey rmatte, mind if I ask you a couple questions about your availability script?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:54:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; go for it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:55:21] &lt;mloven&gt; first off... awesome script.&#160;&#160; It runs great out of the box, but I'm looking to be able to pull availability stats for individual customers (i.e. groups)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:55:48] &lt;mloven&gt; and since my zendmd/python foo is weak, I'm having issues...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:56:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:56:00] &lt;majikman&gt; what is the MIB sub tree in the snmpd.conf you guys are using for zenoss? Mines is currently just .1 and thats way too much data</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:56:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; mloven: it would be simple enough to do... let me just check something and I'll explain how to do it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:56:50] &lt;twm1010&gt; majikman: I don't limit it at all.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:56:57] &lt;mloven&gt; I think I've narrowed down the problem to being due to a space in the customer name....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:56:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I don't limit it either</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:57:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you limit it Zenoss may have issues modelling the device</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:57:28] &lt;mloven&gt; rmatte: but I'm not positive about the space....&#160; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:57:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; mloven: well, what mods have you done so far?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:57:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; mloven: I may be able to correct them for you</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:58:01] &lt;majikman&gt; twm1010, when i'm not limiting it, i constantly get errors about not being able to read process on that device</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:58:38] &lt;mloven&gt; rmatte: well I figured the best approach was just to edit the for d in dmd.Devices.Server.getSubDevices(): section and add in a call for a particular group.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:58:39] &lt;majikman&gt; do you have that issue to?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:59:15] &lt;mloven&gt; rmatte:&#160; we have our groups laid out as /Groups/Customers/customername</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:59:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; mloven: where did you come across that script by the way? or did I paste the link for you?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:59:41] &lt;mloven&gt; rmatte: but in this customer's case, there's a space in the name (i.e. Customer Name)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:59:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; mloven: ah, we do something similar on multi-customer boxes</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 15:59:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; the space shouldn't matter provided it's coded properly</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:00:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:00:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; you may just not be using the most ideal function</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:00:18] &lt;mloven&gt; rmatte:&#160; you pasted the link for someone...&#160;&#160; I may have swiped it...... :-D</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:00:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:00:46] &lt;mloven&gt; rmatte:&#160; yeah, I couldn't figure out how to escape it properly...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:00:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a different approach to suggest, give me a minute to put the code together...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:00:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm pretty sure he pated it for me... and it was a pastebin</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:01:01] &lt;mloven&gt; rmatte:&#160; sure, thanks.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:01:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; i copied and pasted it to some text file buried in my home directory</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:02:23] &lt;mloven&gt; Yeah, rmatte pasted an awesome zencommand script once that I lost.....&#160;&#160;&#160; vowed to never let that happen again...&#160; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:02:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I did?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:02:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; I probably still have it kicking around if you need it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:02:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure which it was though</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:03:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; cruelty: putting the IT guy trying to lose his guts next to the vending machine</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:03:45] &lt;mloven&gt; it's on my list of stuff to ask you for at some point.&#160; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:04:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:05:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; do you remember what it did?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:05:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; im out, later!</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:07:19] &lt;mloven&gt; If I recall correctly it polled a server for the number of CPU's it had, then based the datapoint on that number...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:07:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmmm</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:07:44] &lt;mloven&gt; I was going to tweak it for hard drives....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:09:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it doesn't dynamically assign datapoints</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:09:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have different templates for different numbers of CPUs</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:10:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I use the same command script for each template</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:10:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; do you remember if it was a python script or a bash script?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:10:57] &lt;mloven&gt; bash I think</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:11:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah...</span><br/><span><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:11:34] &lt;rmatte&gt;

they are both used in my Windows SNMP Performance Monitor ZenPack</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:12:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure if that's the one you wanted?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:14:09] &lt;mloven&gt; Yep, I think that CPU one was the ticket...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:14:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:14:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I need to convert those to python eventually</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:14:44] &lt;rmatte&gt;

and you were awol....&#160; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:30:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:30:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I worked from home yesterday, buckled down and got some coding done</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:31:07] &lt;kobalt&gt; hrmm wonder how long this zenbackup will take ...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:31:43] &lt;mloven&gt; well thanks again rmatte.&#160;&#160; I'm off to churn out some reports....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:32:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool, np</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:32:59] &lt;kisielk&gt; hm, my dashboard is blank :/</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:33:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; then add some items to it?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:33:42] &lt;kisielk&gt; I mean, it's not supposed to be. And there's nowhere to add items from</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:33:50] &lt;kobalt&gt; IE?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:34:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; IE8 doesn't play nice with Zenoss if that's what you're using</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:34:16] &lt;kisielk&gt; no, Safari. It wasn't blank this morning</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:34:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:34:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; upgraded Zenoss recently?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:34:42] &lt;kisielk&gt; yeah, I upgraded to 2.5 yesterday</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:34:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; then clear your browser cache</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:34:55] &lt;kisielk&gt; but the dashboard was working after the upgrade</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:34:56] &lt;kisielk&gt; hm</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:34:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's part of the upgrade steps</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:35:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; try it anyways</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:36:22] &lt;kisielk&gt; alright, that seems to have done it, thanks</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:36:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; no problem</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:39:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; mloven: if you ever need other reports like that one I've coded a few</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:39:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; mloven: we're using them to fully automate our monthly reporting for our clients</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:40:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've done cpu, memory, interfaces, filesystem, inventory</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:41:15] &lt;mloven&gt; rmatte:&#160;&#160; that's awesome....&#160;&#160; luckily for us, our customers haven't really expressed a desire for reporting...&#160;&#160; we just got one that all of a sudden wanted availability reporting.....&#160;&#160;&#160; and as you know, Zenoss' built in avail report kinda sucks...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:41:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:41:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; the exporting of it sucks anyways (buggy)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:41:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; they've apparently fixed the exporting in King Crab</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:42:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I haven't tested it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:42:17] &lt;mloven&gt; well, and the fact that you can only run the report for all devices, or a single device, but not groups of devices....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:42:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:42:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's pretty dump</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:42:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; dumb*</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:42:47] &lt;mloven&gt; that gets old quick...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:42:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; the reporting needs to be totally revamped</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:43:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I did a writeup on how the reporting should be improved, I also passed along additional comments about it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:43:32] &lt;mloven&gt; yeah.&#160;&#160; luckily I think they've heard enough bitching about it that they'll probably work that in pretty soon.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:43:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; hopefully it'll make a difference</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:44:30] &lt;mloven&gt; I hear ya.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So yeah, I may hit you up in the future if we run into any customers that want additional reporting.&#160; :)&#160;&#160; thanks for the offer.</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:44:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; Here's what I wrote (pastebin style)</span><br/><span><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:44:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m267b0f98">http://pastebin.com/m267b0f98</a></span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:44:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's actually in a really nicely written doc file</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:44:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; just too lazy to post the file lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:45:39] &lt;mloven&gt; nah, this is awesome...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:48:46] &lt;majikman&gt; do you guys know how many developers work for zenoss?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:49:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; there were 7, and they hired another 2</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:49:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually sorry</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:49:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; there were 5 full time developers</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:49:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; and 2 support developers not working full time</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:49:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; and they recently hire 2 more full time</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:49:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; so they are up to 7 full time with 2 support</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:50:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; the 2 support developers generally do engineering work but do some coding for the project on the side (such as Chet)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:51:20] &lt;mloven&gt; that's really good!&#160;&#160;&#160; but...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:51:31] &lt;mloven&gt; you've only been using Zenoss for 10 months?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:51:42] &lt;mloven&gt; sheesh....&#160;&#160; now I feel really dumb...&#160; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:51:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually I'm basically up to a year now</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:52:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; that doc was written a couple months ago</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:52:26] &lt;mloven&gt; I feel like I spend all my time "fixing" zenoss...&#160; It's rare that I get time to actually do cool stuff with it...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:53:07] &lt;mloven&gt; we have a very spread out cluster, so I'm sure that has a lot to do with it....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:53:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; trust me, I do a heck of a lot of fixing too, but we have a really interesting Zenoss setup here, so I've had to come up with pretty crazy solutions to stuff</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:53:27] &lt;mloven&gt; what's your setup?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:53:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; we're basically trying to setup/code an advanced MSP (NOC) environment from all open source or custom coded stuff</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:53:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; right now I manage 11 Zenoss Core servers</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:53:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; 3 of those servers monitor multiple clients</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:53:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2 are internal</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:54:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; the rest monitor 1 client per box</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:54:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; when events are generated tickets are automatically generated in the ticketing system (OTRS)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:54:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then our front line analysts work the issues from there</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:54:44] &lt;mloven&gt; nice.&#160;&#160; so why the separate servers?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:55:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, setting up multiple collectors with Zenoss core is a pain</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:55:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; and also for security reasons</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:55:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; some of those clients have access to login to Zenoss themselves</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:55:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; we don't want them to be able to see anything other than their stuff</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:56:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; it also reduces the impact if a server goes down</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:56:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; we only lose monitoring on one client instead of 20</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:56:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:56:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's overall just more flexible</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:56:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; setting up a new server takes like 2 minutes</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:57:02] &lt;mloven&gt; true...&#160;&#160; all good points...&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So your front line folks just watch the ticketing system, or do they watch 11 event consoles?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:57:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; we have a VM image named client-base (which I built) that comes pre-configured</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:57:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I just clone the image to a VM, boot it up, change the IPs, hostname, and hosts file, and I'm done</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:58:07] &lt;mloven&gt; tunnel to the customer?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:58:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; mloven: they just watching the ticketing system, though if they click on the device name in the ticket it's a link that brings them right to the device page in Zenoss</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:58:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, we have a tunnel to each customer</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:58:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; we have 2 tunnels to our largest customer</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:58:50] &lt;mloven&gt; interesting...&#160;&#160; that's a really smart way to do it....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:59:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it works well</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:59:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; the system is still very much under development</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 16:59:42] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: what happens if you get a interface that bounces like 20 times in about 10 minutes does it create 20 tickets</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:00:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, there's an event count field in each ticket, it just increments the count on the ticket</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:00:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; and if the ticket is in pending it moves it to open state automatically to bring it to the attention of the analysts</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:00:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; they have the option to put it in a "suppressed" state to avoid it popping back to open if they want</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:00:57] &lt;mloven&gt; we've got a master server, 6 hubs and ~27 collectors....&#160;&#160;&#160; Each customer has their own collector....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:01:10] &lt;kobalt&gt; interesting</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:01:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you're running enterprise I assume?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:01:41] &lt;mloven&gt; we use a ticketing system called Service-Now which we can push incidents to from Zenoss</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:01:47] &lt;mloven&gt; and yep, enterprise :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:02:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, if we were using enterprise we'd probably be using the whole hub -&gt; collector model</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:02:07] &lt;mloven&gt; i.e. I've got Chet on speed dial...&#160; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:02:20] &lt;mloven&gt; you know...&#160;&#160; in retrospect....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:02:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; we were eventually going to do it that way with core but decided against it</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:02:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; and quite honestly, I like having the separate servers myself</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:02:38] &lt;mloven&gt; your way looks pretty good to me right now....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:02:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just use ZenPacks to keep everything synced up</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:02:58] &lt;mloven&gt; well...&#160;&#160; that's an issue too.....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:03:16] &lt;mloven&gt; syncing hubs and collectors is a time consuming process.....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:03:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; but our setup is a year's worth of development work</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:03:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; and we have at least another year to go before it's truly setup the way we want</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:03:34] &lt;mloven&gt; and there's nothing in place to do it automagically</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:03:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; except for Chet :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:04:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; "Chet, sync those collectors"</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:04:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; Chet: "Roger"</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:04:04] &lt;mloven&gt; nah, Chet doesn't like being called for that kind of stuff...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:04:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:04:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, he's a busy guy</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:04:16] &lt;mloven&gt; he ignores my calls/skype chats then...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:04:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:04:46] &lt;mloven&gt; And Rusty's girlfriend yells at him when he works on our stuff....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:04:48] &lt;mloven&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:04:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:05:10] &lt;mloven&gt; It's not my fault our stuff always breaks on Friday night....</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:05:12] &lt;mloven&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:05:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; right now I'm coding a daemon to call the ticket create script</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:08:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've apparently been babbling on to myself for the last minute or two</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:08:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; well, how about mapping/transforming them to a class that uses event commands</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:08:21] &lt;davetoo&gt; and use some kind of queuing system</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:08:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; no</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:08:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; the ticket flood problem?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:08:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:08:28] &lt;davetoo&gt; I've been answering you</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:08:33] &lt;davetoo&gt; you didn't see that?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:08:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:08:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hate netsplits</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:09:56] &lt;mloven&gt; I saw all your comments rmatte.&#160;&#160; They just came all at once at the end of a lot of connect messages...&#160; :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:10:25] &lt;majikman&gt; is there a way to have zenoss dump all the configuration changes to one config file so that i do things like diff it against a previous version?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:12:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: try the zendump command</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:12:54] &lt;majikman&gt; k thanks</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:13:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; majikman: it'll dump all zope values in xml format</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:13:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can diff the dumps</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:13:31] &lt;majikman&gt; so that will save every change i've ever made to zenoss?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:13:42] &lt;majikman&gt; or are some of the changes stored in the databae?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:13:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, no, I don't think Zenoss even tracks previous changes</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:13:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; it keeps a log of when they were done but not what the changes were</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:14:05] &lt;majikman&gt; oh... hmm...</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:14:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; it doesn't have any kind of version control</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:14:19] &lt;majikman&gt; what about zenbackup?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:14:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; what about it?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:14:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm saying the data literally isn't there to grab lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:15:01] &lt;majikman&gt; i don't really need zenoss to do the version control. if it can just dump every setting into a location, i can save all that data to a repository and do diffs later</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:15:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're wanting to somehow extract a change history from Zenoss, but it doesn't exist other than logs of when the changes were done</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:15:12] &lt;majikman&gt; no... i don't want a change history. i just want every setting</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:15:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; ohhhh</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:15:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; then use zendump, that should work fine</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:15:32] &lt;majikman&gt; i'd rather use something like subversion/git that is built for the purpose of versioning anyways</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:15:38] &lt;majikman&gt; ok, thanks</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:16:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; zendump takes a while to run through</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:16:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll probably end up with a pretty big file too</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:16:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:48:38] &lt;kisielk&gt; hm, with the new Event Console</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:48:44] &lt;kisielk&gt; is there a way to filter out devices by priority?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:50:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; not that I'm aware of</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:50:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; not based on device severity</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:53:39] &lt;kisielk&gt; ah, I see you can still create event views</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:55:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; are they easier to get to?</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:55:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; Buried a little deep right now, to be considered convenient :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 17:55:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; I need to look at some of the custom dashboard portals</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 18:21:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm sure the event console will get more features with time</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 18:21:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; anyways, I'm heading home, later guys</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 18:38:18] &lt;davetoo&gt; hmm</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 18:38:42] &lt;davetoo&gt; ldap auth seems different in 2.5</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 19:28:07] &lt;kisielk&gt; davetoo: no they're the same. I just bookmark them</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 19:28:34] &lt;davetoo&gt; I screw myself up by logging into the zope root as admin, and get confused between the two acl_users :)</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 21:09:37] Bryanstein is now known as zz_Bryanstein</span><br/><span> [29-Oct-2009 21:09:51] zz_Bryanstein is now known as Bryanstein</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 00:00:46] [disconnected at Fri Oct 30 00:00:46 2009]</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 00:00:46] [connected at Fri Oct 30 00:00:46 2009]</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 00:00:55] [zenoss-logger (logger bot) has joined #zenoss]</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 01:41:25] jelmer is now known as Guest85358</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 02:17:28] Guest85358 is now known as jelmer</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 02:17:58] jelmer is now known as Guest78392</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 02:18:22] Guest78392 is now known as jelmer</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 04:52:34] masterhumper is now known as sejo</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:20:25] &lt;klinstifen&gt;

both work for me&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; community.zenoss.com redirects to community.zenoss.org</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:22:43] &lt;klinstifen&gt; yeah .org that's what i meant</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:22:45] &lt;klinstifen&gt;

morning</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:53:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; How goes it?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:55:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; just following up on any 2.5 issues that come up</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:56:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; I've got a wild hair to backup my prod box this weekend and then update it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:56:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; As soon as Egor's zenpack goes final</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:56:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well.. there are a couple of 2.5 patches already</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:56:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm... perhaps i'll wait</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:56:59] &lt;twm1010&gt; I usually wait until 2.x.&gt;1</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:57:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; plus i still want to duplicate the upgrade path</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:57:32] &lt;twm1010&gt; 2.4.2 &gt; 2.5.x + wmi update</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:58:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, I'm waiting to hear that what's in Subversion should be published as official by Egor</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 08:59:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; Once this went from my little pet project to people looking at the reports everyday, i can't do shoot from the hip upgrades anymore</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:01:19] &lt;mdereus&gt; twm1010: this is my pet project spawned from our executive committee wanting uptime/availability information, now I can't get the rest of the IT team to adopt it :(</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:01:20] &lt;suprsonic&gt; mrayzenoss any of the patches address my issue?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:02:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; suprsonic: the OID one?&#160; I don't think so.&#160; mrchippy was looking at it, I don't think he found anything</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:02:11] &lt;suprsonic&gt; k</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:02:29] &lt;suprsonic&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:02:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; mdereus: That sounds familiar :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:05:18] &lt;mrchippy&gt; suprsonic: hey, i sent a trap using snmptrap and the zero made it into the event.&#160; if i send you a file + instructions, would you have time to apply it, generate the trap, and send me the output?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:06:06] &lt;suprsonic&gt; sure</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:06:13] &lt;suprsonic&gt; where would you like me to send to?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:07:02] &lt;suprsonic&gt; thanks mrchippy</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:11:51] &lt;suprsonic&gt; this app is fricken awesome</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:12:04] * suprsonic just clicked on Network Map</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:14:31] &lt;eidolon&gt; our network map never actually worked.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:18:50] &lt;QubeZ&gt; hello all</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:19:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hello</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:19:09] &lt;QubeZ&gt; after upgrading to 2.5 from 2.4.5, i have a device in my devices list called EC2Manager, is it safe to remove?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:19:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; QubeZ: I doubt that's some device that was added by Zenoss during the upgrade</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:19:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've done various upgrades and never seen that</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:20:02] &lt;QubeZ&gt; it wasn't there before the upgrade</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:20:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; so yes, it's safe to remove</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:20:05] &lt;QubeZ&gt; thanks</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:20:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh wait</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:20:22] &lt;QubeZ&gt; its in /AWS/EC2</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:20:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's part of that new cloud zenpack</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:20:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you install the EC2 ZenPack?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:20:55] &lt;QubeZ&gt; not manually no, just did upgrade and then installed the core-zenpacks</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:21:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; it is one of the core ZenPacks</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:21:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's included with the core-zenpacks</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:21:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:21:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's brand new</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:21:18] &lt;QubeZ&gt; ahh ok, i dont know what that device is</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:21:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-4423.html">docs/DOC-4423</a></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:21:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can probably just remove that whole ZenPack man</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:21:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless you're monitoring clouds</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:22:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; (I'd advise not just installing the entire core zenpack set and only installing what you actually need in the future)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:22:18] &lt;QubeZ&gt; ZenAWS, i'll remove it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:22:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:22:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we're actually discussing making more of the Core ZenPacks installed by default</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:22:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; AWS, HTTP, Apache, LinuxMonitor, MySQL</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:23:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, you might want to discuss making the EC2Manager device un-removable while the ZenPack is still installed</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:24:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; I woudn't personally see AWS as something that needs to be installed by default</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:24:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; only certain users are actually going to need that</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:24:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; the rest though are quite common needs</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:24:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; if we're going to advertise that it's available and new users show up expecting it...</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:24:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we're trying to make it easier for new users</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:25:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you direct them to the appropriate ZenPack download page :P</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:25:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; the ZenPack page just needs to be better organized than it is now</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:25:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just a big mish-mash</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:25:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: whats the link to your blog post about importing the cisco mibs?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:25:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and by mish-mash you mean alphabetical list :P</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:25:39] &lt;klinstifen&gt; its crazyness!</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:25:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; he means it should be categorized by application</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:25:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: you want the version on my personal blog or my zenoss blog?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:25:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; but I agree, we need some sort of categorizaiton</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:25:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; whichever one is better :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:26:04] &lt;klinstifen&gt; yeah categories might clean up the list a bit</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:26:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; by mish-mash I mean why do I have to scroll through every community ZenPack to find all the core ZenPacks?"</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:26:17] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm importing a mib and i seem to rememember you setting up some paths first that made it easy</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:26:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; for example</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:26:23] &lt;klinstifen&gt; could go generic...ms,*nix,etc</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:26:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; or what if I only want Linux related ZenPacks</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:26:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; once again, scrolling through and reading to find them</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:26:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: I added the Enterprise ones in a sub-list yesterday&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; should I pull out the Core ones?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:26:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a mess lol</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:26:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I'd definitely say so</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:26:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; give the core ones their own table</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:27:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; and we can work on categorizing the rest somehow later on</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:27:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; maybe "Network Devices", "Unix", "Portlets", "Windows", "Databases"?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:27:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte:&#160; i found it :)</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:27:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://demonic.cc/?p=20">http://demonic.cc/?p=20</a></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:28:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; "Miscellaneous"</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:28:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, something like tha</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:28:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; that*</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:28:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; it would look more professional and would be much easier on users</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:28:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, any word on getting the ZenPack ratings actually showing up in the list?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:29:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we're a bit swamped, but that's on the list</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:29:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, I think it might be time for some pruning at some point, if I ZenPack has been rendered utterly obsolete by another pack, then it may be time to pull the plug on it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:30:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; if a ZenPack*</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:30:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; rather</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:30:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I've been pulling them off the main list</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:30:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:30:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the 3 netapps, the extra exchange, I'm going to pull one of the Terminal Services ones</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:30:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; I agree, leave them available if searched for, but they don't need to be in the list</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:30:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; might want to start looking at the WMI ones too</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:31:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'll have the updated list in a second</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:31:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; Egor's packs rendered a couple of them obsolete</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:31:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; second meaning a couple of miutes</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:31:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:31:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; couple of minutes meaning next Tuesday?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:31:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:31:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:31:39] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm working on it right now :p</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:31:48] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte:&#160; you know, i'm STILL moving Cisco mibs..</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:32:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: should have used my ZenPack</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:32:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; its more of a when I'm bored thing, i grab about 60-100 and start moving them 10 at a time,&#160; but its so SLOW</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:32:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:32:20] &lt;twm1010&gt; well, you told me to do it manually :P</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:32:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm pretty sure I didn't say that lol</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:32:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; I always encourage people to use the ZenPack</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:32:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; if you're interested, the zenmib rewrite should be back-portable</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:32:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's just 1 file</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:32:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; takes a heck of a long time to install but a lot less manual labour</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:33:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; It was before you fixed the problem with the utilization that the zenpack caused</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:33:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; ohhhh</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:33:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's a long arse time ago</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:33:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; you might as well just abort, install the pack, and be done with it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:33:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:33:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; I could just delete them all</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:33:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; and then repack zope :|</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:33:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; Happy Halloween: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://gnome-look.org/CONTENT/content-pre1/114589-1.png">http://gnome-look.org/CONTENT/content-pre1/114589-1.png</a></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:33:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:34:06] &lt;twm1010&gt; but, my gui goes really unresponsive moving things</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:34:13] &lt;twm1010&gt; hell, changing device classes, not just moving mibs</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:34:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; According to Trac I figured out that fix 4 months ago</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:34:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; I don't understand why its so slow. I get concurrent access messages often</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:35:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; 2009-07-09 to be precise</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:35:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:35:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; sometimes i can't even delete a device</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:36:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; possible that the box is just too slow?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:36:14] &lt;twm1010&gt; Yes, it is</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:36:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; It's a DL380G4, yesteryear's CPU and processors</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:36:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm going to ask for better hardware when I'm up in Chicago next week</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:37:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, how much processing power and RAM?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:38:21] &lt;twm1010&gt; 1 x 3.2Ghz Xeon (single core) 4GB ram</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:38:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol, the workstation that I built for my mom last weekend could run Zenoss better than that thing :P</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:38:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it only cost like $600</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:39:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that's still decent</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:39:20] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, let me check insight manager, it might have more than one CPU</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:39:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; how many devices are you monitoring with it?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:39:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; 200</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:39:52] &lt;twm1010&gt; alot of server</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:40:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; like how many?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:40:11] &lt;twm1010&gt; 122</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:40:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; windows, linux?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:40:16] &lt;eidolon&gt; "tht's not a lot."</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:40:18] &lt;eidolon&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:40:25] &lt;mdereus&gt; With this new zenactions.py file, what's the best method to update it?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:40:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; mostly windows</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:40:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's pretty intensive</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:40:49] &lt;eidolon&gt; okay, 122 windows servers is pain.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:40:53] &lt;eidolon&gt; that's like 600 real servers.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:40:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; the most I'm monitoring on 1 box is like 80 windows servers (but I'm also monitoring about 120 routers and 120 switches on the same box)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:41:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's a VM too, it can scale over 6GHz if needed and has 5GB of RAM assigned to it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:41:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; Hrmm... no, there are more CPUs</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:41:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; looks like dual hyper-threaded xeons</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:41:46] &lt;twm1010&gt; so, really 2 processors</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:41:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; technically 4</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:42:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; if they are hyper threaded</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:42:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; i've been meaning to figure out how to adjust the smartarray controller to optomize for wirte</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:42:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; The server I have sitting on my desk at home has Quad Xeons with hyperthreading, looks like 8 processors, it's fun fun</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:42:42] &lt;twm1010&gt; writes</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:42:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ok, done.&#160; Check out </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="community/zenpacks?view=overview">community/zenpacks?view=overview</a></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:43:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm open to other suggestions for manageablility</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:43:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: you missed Jabber</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:43:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh you didn't</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:43:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; you just didn't remove it from the other list</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:43:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; left it on the list</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:43:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:44:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; might as well just remove it from the list</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:44:16] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm... anyone happen to know how to adjust an HP smartarray controller's cache balance from within linux?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:44:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; oh, NICE, the raid controller doesn't have a battery</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:44:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; therefore, not using cache at all</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:44:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:44:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:44:41] &lt;twm1010&gt; that's just awesome.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:44:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; fixed</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:45:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; woot</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:45:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; now we just need to categorize the Unix, Windows, Portlet, etc...</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:45:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, I've got some other stuff I need to go work on, but it's a little better today</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:46:28] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: it IS faster to delete the MIBs</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:46:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: yeh, it usually is</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:46:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: because it's not actually writing data, it's just marking them as deleted</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:47:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; the more I remove, the faster it moves</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:47:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:47:16] &lt;twm1010&gt; I should probably repack zope when this is done huh</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:47:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; yar</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:47:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: the most obvious ones for categorization are Windows, Unix, Portlets, and Mibs, the rest can be categorized over a period of time</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:48:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; there are only 3 mib zenpacks</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:48:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but there will probably be more eventually</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:48:47] &lt;twm1010&gt; I've always thought ZenPacks needed classification, in the application itself</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:49:15] &lt;twm1010&gt; force a separation between performance template zenpacks and ones that extend the application</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:49:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; Maybe they should be filed under "Network", "Windows", etc...</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:49:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: basically more modularity</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:49:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:50:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh I see what you're saying</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:50:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we're working on some scripts to make documenting ZenPacks easier&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; that may tie in with it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:50:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; basically "enhancements" versus "packs"</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:50:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Monitoring vs. Features</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:50:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; "Web-Based Synthetic Transactions" is an enterprise pack?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:51:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; there's an Enterprise one and a Community one</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:51:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:51:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; they both use twill from the looks of it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:51:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, the Enterprise one has some extra features</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:52:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; but the Community one is good for most scenarios</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:52:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; the community one is working exceptionally well for me so far, though I've made some tweaks to the template and added a couple of transforms in</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:52:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; just to fancy it up a bit</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:52:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the Enterprise one will let you set thresholds between steps of the script</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:52:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:52:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so if you hit 5 pages, you can alert if page 3 loads slow</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:52:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's pretty cool</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:53:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, I had one of the devs walk me through the differences</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:53:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; the client that I'm using the twill pack for is quite impressed with the accuracy of the alerting</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:53:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; since I usually don't pay attention to the Enterprise stuff :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:53:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; it actually alerts better than the internal diagnostics of the web app itself :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:54:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; cool</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:54:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm also running the HttpMon pack on the same server, and it's neat because the response time graph for the twill pack is almost identical to the one for the httpmon pack</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:54:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; uhh</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:54:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; uhhhhhhh</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:54:57] &lt;twm1010&gt; you guys ever seen the webgui be missing the contextual drop downs?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:55:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: happens once in a blue moon</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:55:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; reload</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:55:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; and if that doesn't work, clear your cache</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:55:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's certainly a browser issue</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:56:27] &lt;twm1010&gt; k</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:57:04] &lt;twm1010&gt; :O someone put my zenoss server into runlevel 5?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:57:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: does the enterprise twill pack allow you to edit the twill scripts right from the UI?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:57:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:57:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and have multiple twill scripts per host</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:57:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; that would be pretty neat</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:57:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and does xml with xpath</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:57:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:57:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; so how long before we can have that in Core?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:57:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:58:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; that's why I was having a dev present it to me</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:58:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; since there's functionality in the Community one, I wanted to see the value of leaving it in Enterprise</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:58:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I proposed moving it to Core</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:58:59] &lt;eidolon&gt; YAYAYAY!</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:59:05] &lt;eidolon&gt; i kicked support in the 'nads, and Nate updated my case.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:59:13] &lt;eidolon&gt; yay pokey annoying customers!</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:59:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I gave them a big list of things to move into Core from the Community and from Enterprise&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; they're assessing them</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 09:59:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the Amazon stuff was slated for Enterprise, we convinced them it belonged in Core</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:00:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; more stuff is coming slowly</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:01:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; well i'll be, you can adjust the raid controller right from insight manager</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:03:39] &lt;twm1010&gt; Anything else that might cause missing context menus?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:04:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; logged in as a read-only user?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:05:18] &lt;suprsonic&gt; mrchippy mind you, 2.4.5 resolved the mibs correctly</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:05:28] &lt;suprsonic&gt; only 2.5 does it not resolve the mib I sent you.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:06:46] &lt;mrchippy&gt; yeah that seems to be what i'm seeing. &lt;&#226;&#8364;&#8221; this sucks</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:50:14] &lt;twm1010&gt; what do you think, about 25% read cache 75% write for zenoss sound about right</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:51:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:51:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd almost go 35/65</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:51:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; :O it won't let me adjust it!</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:51:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; meh</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:51:51] &lt;davetoo&gt; mrayzenoss: do you have a graph of zenoss download rates per day/week?&#160; Seems like we're getting a lot of momentum going :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:51:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; 25/75 should be fine</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:51:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; might be because the battery is missing</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:52:07] &lt;twm1010&gt; no, i mean it won't let me adjust it from 100%read/0%write</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:52:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: well, they did hit over a million downloads hehe</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:52:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: oh, shitty</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:53:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; davetoo: yeah, sourceforge tracks that</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:53:56] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm, that might explain ALOT</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:54:17] &lt;twm1010&gt; i'm using all the disks in a RAID5 for everything, so write cahce would be important</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:55:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:57:57] &lt;twm1010&gt; yep! got it... i need one of these : </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.cdw.com/shop/products/default.aspx?EDC=678111">http://www.cdw.com/shop/products/default.aspx?EDC=678111</a></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:58:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; im hoping one of our other DL380's has it, so i can steal it :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 10:59:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:02:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; So who's the zenoss, in LDAP "expert"?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:02:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; As in, Zenoss using LDAP or Zenoss monitoring LDAP?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:02:35] &lt;davetoo&gt; authentication, sorry.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:02:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; authentication is slightly different for Core vs. Enterprise</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:03:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes,</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:03:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Enterprise has a ZenPack to smooth it over, Core has documentation.&#160; My guess would be npmccallum might be good to ask, since he wrote the first incarnation of the Community one and works for Zenoss now</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:04:24] &lt;davetoo&gt; I have a ticket open, Nick answered it, I was just curious if any of the folks that hang out here work on the enterprise auth</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:04:27] &lt;npmccallum&gt; davetoo: how can I help?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:04:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; I got the AD one to work for the most part</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:04:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; aye :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:05:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; so I'm going off-road and trying to test the enterprise beta zenpacks with core 2.5.0</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:05:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; and zope can't load the new PAS plugins</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:05:26] &lt;davetoo&gt; can</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:05:37] &lt;davetoo&gt; t load UserFolder and some others,</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:05:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; 'cause it can't find libssl.o.4</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:06:16] &lt;davetoo&gt; just wondered if there's known to be something missing right now?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:06:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; well now you're just a rebel aren't ya</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:06:25] &lt;davetoo&gt; impatient :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:07:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; actually I wanted to see if the new version of PAS (1.6.1 vs 1.4) handled better whatever the heck our Corp IT did to their LDAP data</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:07:35] &lt;davetoo&gt; suddenly this week I can't use the roleManager, so I was really just trying to use zenoss to troubleshoot something else :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:07:54] &lt;davetoo&gt; I have a Sugar case open</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:08:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; Nick answered it with a guess</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:08:29] &lt;twm1010&gt; damn every DL380 I have doens't have the writeback module</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:08:38] &lt;davetoo&gt; that's a Dell?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:08:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; hp</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:08:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh, n/mind</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:09:23] &lt;jb&gt; LDAP integration is less than ideal..</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:09:29] &lt;jb&gt; (even in enterprise)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:10:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm going to have probably close to 100 people that need to authenticate into this thing :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:10:44] &lt;jb&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:10:49] &lt;jb&gt; we aren't even using it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:10:54] &lt;jb&gt; but we really need to be..</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:11:14] &lt;kobalt&gt; anyone know what format the date/time is imputted into the database for first and last time?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:11:15] &lt;jb&gt; but won't until its functionality is improved</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:11:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; This isn't really a Zenoss problem I'm seeing, it's Zope</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:11:38] &lt;kobalt&gt; I did a db dump and am trying to format it excel</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:11:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; Hrmmm.. I can apparently enable writecache without a battery, something tells me thats a bit foolish? :D</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:11:58] &lt;jb&gt; davetoo: how do you restrict which LDAP/AD users are able to login to zen?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:12:04] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'm using the ZMI to pre-cache roles for new users, so they don't have to call me and have me upgrade them to ZenManager after logging in the first time</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:12:09] &lt;davetoo&gt; jb I haven't solved that one yet :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:12:16] &lt;jb&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:12:20] &lt;davetoo&gt; but this is all internal so that can wait</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:12:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; for now I've just had to set the default role to ZenManager.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:12:56] &lt;jb&gt; ideally.. i would want to add a user to an AD group which would grant them access.. or at least pre-create their user in zenoss and assign their roles</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:13:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; I really need one or two more levels of access control between ZenOperator and ZenManager :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:13:22] &lt;davetoo&gt; but that's a core zenoss infrastructure project</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:13:38] &lt;jb&gt; also, for some reason.. once you enable LDAP in zenoss.. and then login as a "local" zenoss user (like admin), it tries to authenticate 'admin' against your LDAP source every click in the GUI</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:13:47] &lt;jb&gt; therefore, locking out the LDAP "admin" account</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:14:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; I really would like people to be able to create reports but not rip out my whole system by deleting the wrong zenpack</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:14:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:14:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; and I get tons of errors in the log becaus of that</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:14:23] &lt;jb&gt; yeah</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:14:28] &lt;jb&gt; its really annoying</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:15:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; and in fact that behavior might be triggering this bug; I was looking at packet traces in wireshark and the last thing that I see before the rolemanager blows up is some search involving the string 'admin' in the filter</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:15:52] &lt;davetoo&gt; How about RADIUS?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:15:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; or even NIS :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:15:58] &lt;jb&gt; i opened a ticket months ago about it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:16:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; NIS woudl be grat</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:16:03] &lt;davetoo&gt; great, for me</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:16:06] &lt;jb&gt; we need LDAP</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:16:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; does zenoss by default track disk i/o?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:17:05] &lt;kisielk&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:17:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; My group needs to restart our project to run our own LDAP service, for exactly the reasons I'm having trouble right now</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:17:25] &lt;kisielk&gt; of course it's at a pretty coarse resolution, but it does</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:18:34] &lt;twm1010&gt; lunchtime! back in a bit</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:18:59] &lt;davetoo&gt; I think, if I could figure it out in less than a day, I may try to set up my own ldap server pulling data from corp, just for this project.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:19:02] &lt;davetoo&gt; One that I can control.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:19:33] &lt;davetoo&gt; I was trying out the AD plugin yesterday too, but it doesn't seem to follow referrals,</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:19:44] &lt;davetoo&gt; and I can't get Corp IT to answer their email :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:20:39] &lt;kisielk&gt; hm, seems the dashboard is consistently broken in my Safari</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:20:44] &lt;kisielk&gt; but works in Firefox</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:21:25] &lt;jb&gt; davetoo: yeah :(</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:21:39] &lt;jb&gt; i really wish they would improve the AD/LDAP stuff</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:21:46] &lt;eidolon&gt; safari for me works fine with zenoss.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:21:51] &lt;eidolon&gt; i'm on it from my mac al the time</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:22:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Safari is what I use for a "clean" view, no modifications.&#160; My Firefox has too many plugins</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:22:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Chrome works pretty well too</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:22:59] &lt;kisielk&gt; yeah, it seems my dashboard is blank in Safari now</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:23:07] &lt;kisielk&gt; but works fine in Firefox.. and yes, I've cleared my cache</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:24:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; if you guys are serious about Radius and other authentication modules&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;

the guy said he tested it with Zenoss 2.4</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:26:05] &lt;jb&gt; i'll bug support again</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:26:09] &lt;jb&gt; about the AD/LDAP stuff</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:27:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'll get even less help with our RADIUS than ldap.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:27:58] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'd rather .. build my own ldap service 'cause my group needs to do that anyway</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:30:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; but for now I just have to live with it; have to scramble to bring up my Production enterprise set and migrate the data from the dev system</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:30:17] &lt;davetoo&gt; that was supposed to be done today :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:40:17] &lt;nzle&gt; the zenbackup command doesnt seem to allow wone to specify a name for the file.&#160; whats a good way to script doing a backup and scp'n it off the box?&#160;&#160; Just build up the name from the current date, or is there a way to control, or read fromthe environment the name that was used?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 11:41:23] &lt;nzle&gt; oops,&#160; I stand corrected.&#160; I see the -file option, as well as a way to send the output to stdout.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:01:43] &lt;kobalt&gt; mrayzenoss: any idea what format the time stamps are entered into the mysql db? the data I get when I dump the db is in this format 1256918340</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:05:27] Bryanstein is now known as zz_Bryanstein</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:06:13] &lt;Aziraphale&gt;

template, which means it is not applied to an entire device class, but just a</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:22:31] &lt;eidolon&gt; single device" - which template should i add?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:24:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; eidolon: I'm not following you&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; to much cold medicine I guess.&#160; Do you want to add a template to your device class or the individual device?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:24:39] &lt;eidolon&gt; no</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:25:19] &lt;eidolon&gt; i have an open case in enterprise support.&#160; i'm looking for 'best practices' to add basic url monitoring.&#160; not port and host monitoring.&#160; but url monitoring, in a vhost environment.&#160; the answer seems to be add a /device/server device on the IP, then local template, then data sources.&#160; the question is "wht local template do i add'?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:27:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so you can add a new template for the URL monitoring to your device or the class, then add a data source to that template for HTTP monitoring or WebTX</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:27:34] &lt;eidolon&gt; right.&#160; what new template?&#160; :)</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:28:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; from </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://yourserver:8080/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/perfConfig">http://yourserver:8080/zport/dmd/Devices/Server/perfConfig</a><span> select "Add Template" on the page menu</span></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:28:29] &lt;eidolon&gt; sec..</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:28:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and you can name it whatever you want</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:29:07] &lt;eidolon&gt; yah.&#160; i wish zenoss didn't have this 'everything i monitor has an ip address' problem.&#160; it's irritating.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:29:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; man, we've tried every browser and O/S type</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:29:33] &lt;twm1010&gt; my buddy's Zenoss simply does not have drop down context menus</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:29:44] &lt;twm1010&gt;

it's not a read-only account?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:30:16] &lt;twm1010&gt; its the admin account</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:30:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; bizarre</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:30:35] &lt;eidolon&gt;

clearly he's admin, otherwise the management stuff wouldn't show up on the left</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:33:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; you've tried from a different PC?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:33:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh he's admin since it says "admin" in the top right :P</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:33:16] &lt;twm1010&gt; yep</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:33:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; pretty basic question, but have you at least tried restarting Zenoss?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:33:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; is it hooked into LDAP?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:34:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; no, pretty much right past a finished install of stack</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:34:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; restart it anyways</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:35:03] &lt;twm1010&gt; ah, between my lunch break he has started a reinstall, let us see how it turns out</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:35:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've seen people come in here and be like "I'VE FRIGGING TRIED EVERYTHING!"

"Try restarting"&#160; "OMG, It's fixed!!!!"</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:35:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:35:19] &lt;twm1010&gt; heh, yeah.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:35:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:56:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; so im looking at the disk i/o numbers on my zenoss box</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:56:49] &lt;twm1010&gt; i have nothing to bench this against</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:57:35] &lt;twm1010&gt; averaging 2.3k writes/426 reads</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:58:30] &lt;twm1010&gt; those numbers seem kinda low to me?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 12:58:38] &lt;twm1010&gt; considering it's bytes/sec</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:15:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; that is way too low</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:15:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; that can't be right</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:16:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless it's the average between 1bps and 100000000000MBps</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:16:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:19:31] &lt;Skaag&gt; I'm trying to snmpwalk an hp switch I have, I opened tcp/udp port 161 in the firewall for my zenoss machine</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:19:34] &lt;Skaag&gt; but it still times out</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:19:48] &lt;twm1010&gt; did you set the community strings on both the switch and Zenoss?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:20:25] &lt;Skaag&gt; yes</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:20:36] &lt;twm1010&gt; stop your firewall, to take it completely out of the equation, and try again</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:20:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can walk it from the command line?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:20:49] &lt;Skaag&gt; my firewall log showed a block before, so I added the rule.

I prefer Cisco :-)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:29:45] &lt;twm1010&gt; i thougt HP's CLI is supposed to be cisco-esque</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:31:51] &lt;kisielk&gt; it is</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:32:26] &lt;Skaag&gt; I see it supports v3</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:32:37] &lt;Skaag&gt; yes, I went into the CLI and I feel more at home now</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:37:53] &lt;twm1010&gt; v3 is for encryption, not necessary</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:42:44] &lt;Skaag&gt; crap I enabled v3 and now I don't know how to disable it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:42:53] &lt;Skaag&gt; there's only "enable" for the command, no "disable"</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:43:28] &lt;Skaag&gt; ok I used no snmpv3...</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:44:30] &lt;Skaag&gt; it still won't let me walk it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:44:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: HP's CLI is not cisco-esque lol</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:46:38] &lt;Skaag&gt; it's kinda, thankfully... the 'no' keyword seems to work like in IOS</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:46:43] &lt;twm1010&gt; i siad i thought it was :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:46:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; very slightly</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:46:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; but not really</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:47:01] &lt;Skaag&gt; I don't get it... still can't walk it...</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:47:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've worked with Cisco switches and HP switches and I far prefer the Cisco stuff</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:47:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; though the HP stuff is alright</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:48:15] &lt;twm1010&gt; the spice must flow.... i mean... the snmp</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:48:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; desert power!</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:50:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; or even better, dessert power!</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:50:18] &lt;rmatte&gt;

i've had HP switches put me in autoconfiguration hell before</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:52:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; err, autonegotiation</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:53:12] &lt;kobalt&gt; and try to get qnq to work on a hp switch .... yuk</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:54:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; HP's web interface for config (like CiscoWorks) is really really good though</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:54:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I don't like their CLI</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 13:56:24] &lt;Skaag&gt;

but maybe something else is going on.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:27:07] &lt;Skaag&gt; Does that pfSense egg file add a new class of device to zenoss?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:27:10] &lt;Skaag&gt; how does that work?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:27:22] &lt;Skaag&gt; I tried to change the firewall's class but I don't see pfsense in the list</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:34:44] &lt;gwb235&gt; yikes!&#160; my zencommand died and can't get back up!</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:34:46] &lt;gwb235&gt; :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:38:22] zz_Bryanstein is now known as Bryanstein</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:45:10] * kobalt wonders how long it will take zenback to complete....</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:45:47] &lt;zenethian&gt; 3.744 decimoments</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:46:16] &lt;kobalt&gt; lol, however long that is lol its been running for about 5 minutes now</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:46:40] &lt;davetoo&gt; 11 centiwhiles</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:47:36] &lt;kobalt&gt; now if I read it correctly this creates a snapshot of my current setup, correct?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:58:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; finally got all our stuff back up :|</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 14:58:54] &lt;zenethian&gt; So now what will you do to the guy who did it?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:01:40] &lt;Skaag&gt; our IT guy just resigned, thank god</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:01:45] &lt;Skaag&gt; a few days ago</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:02:15] &lt;Skaag&gt; a messy one, he was... nothing worked properly, ever.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:05:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:06:04] &lt;zenethian&gt; typical</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:06:08] &lt;zenethian&gt; *hides from his IT guy*</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:06:11] &lt;zenethian&gt; ;D</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:06:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; g'day egor</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:06:27] &lt;zenethian&gt; Ours is fantastic.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:06:35] &lt;zenethian&gt; but we're a technology company.&#160; Not everyone is so lucky.</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:06:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: not really a "snapshot" but it backs up most of the database</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:06:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: then you can restore from it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:07:21] &lt;bigegor&gt; hey</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:07:29] &lt;suprsonic&gt; is python required to build zenoss?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:07:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenethian: to answer your question, a bitchogram has already been sent to his group lol</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:07:41] &lt;suprsonic&gt; looks like it comes with its own python install</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:07:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: zenoss is written in python, so yes, absolutely</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:08:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: yeh it does, since it requires python 2.4</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:08:25] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: ok cause Im looking to do a upgrade to 2.5 and if it does not go well I want to restore it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:08:30] &lt;suprsonic&gt; okay, so really two different pythons are used in a base install ey?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:08:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: well, generally you'll have python included with your linux install, which is generally python2.6 these days</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:09:09] &lt;suprsonic&gt; very good, thanks</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:09:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: then Zenoss installs it's own for use with Zenoss</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:09:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:19:07] &lt;jY&gt; i'm trying to delete a device in 2.5.. when I navigate to the device.. i don't see a manage option</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:19:14] &lt;jY&gt; i'm logged in as admin</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:34:11] &lt;suprsonic&gt; zenpack backwards compatible with older versions of zenoss?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:34:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; jY: just go to the device list, put a checkmark next to the device, then select Delete Devices from the dropdown</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:34:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: depends on what features the zenpack uses</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:35:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: generally there's a recommended version listed on the ZenPack page</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:36:50] &lt;suprsonic&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:42:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; REQUIREMENTS:</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:42:00] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Zenoss Version: 2.2</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:42:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; like that</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:44:42] &lt;suprsonic&gt; I assume not too many are updated to 2.5 ey?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:46:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: a lot will work in 2.5</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:46:23] &lt;suprsonic&gt; sweet</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 15:57:56] &lt;rhettardo&gt; so how do i get two devices externally monitored via snmp that are on two different ports?</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:08:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; FYI you're still running a Zenoss release before 2.4: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="blogs/zenossblog/2009/03/05/adjusting-zenoss-schedules-for-dst">blogs/zenossblog/2009/03/05/adjusting-zenoss-schedules-for-dst</a></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:08:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that was fixed in 2.4 and 2.5</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:10:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice hehe</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:10:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I guess I should repost it...</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:11:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; for any stragglers</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:11:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could include it in the montly newsletter</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:11:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; monthly*</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:11:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; just as a reminder</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:11:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; or whatever</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:11:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; alas that went out without me getting to edit it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:11:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; really?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:11:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I never even saw it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:12:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I saw Mark's email about the training</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:12:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; that wasn't it?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:12:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hmm&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; maybe it's just on the blog</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:15:43] &lt;davetoo&gt; ok</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:15:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; where's the ZOPE guru? :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:16:07] &lt;davetoo&gt; need to figure out if the ldap-related zope products had been customized</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:16:27] &lt;davetoo&gt; or whether the stock zope products should work; I want to try to upgrade some of them on a sandbox</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:19:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that would be Ian</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:19:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; perhaps with 2.5, probably not with 2.4</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:19:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 2.5 upgraded us to Zope 2.11.2</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:19:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; with very few patches</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:19:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 2.4 is on Zope 2.8.8 with many patches</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:21:39] &lt;davetoo&gt; I'll try brute force first: download the products from the net and run a recursive diff :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:22:12] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or look at our source for patches, we usually label them</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:22:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/browser/branches/zenoss-2.5.x/inst/externallibs">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/browser/branches/zenoss-2.5.x/inst/externallibs</a></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:23:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: yeh, I never saw an email go out with the newsletter</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:23:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it hasn't gone out yet, so my updates made it in</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:23:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah good stuff</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:23:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the Daylight Saving Time will be on the blog though</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:23:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:23:47] &lt;davetoo&gt; oh, yeah</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:23:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:24:01] &lt;davetoo&gt; my vista64 system jumped that gun&#160; by a week :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:24:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

dude!</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:25:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; This deserves three t-shirts :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:25:14] &lt;davetoo&gt; All your Node are Belong to Us</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:25:22] &lt;rmatte&gt;

and I think that's the next big show</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:25:48] &lt;davetoo&gt; and if you don't use that, I will make some for myself :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:26:00] &lt;rmatte&gt;

then why the heck do you even pay for support?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:26:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:26:50] &lt;davetoo&gt; because they've been away for two or three years</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:27:00] &lt;davetoo&gt; and they're both as busy as I am</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:27:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:27:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we let them leave to go evangelize and find us customers :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:27:50] &lt;davetoo&gt;

lol</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:30:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; done: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="blogs/zenossblog/2009/10/30/adjusting-zenoss-23-and-earlier-schedules-for-dst">blogs/zenossblog/2009/10/30/adjusting-zenoss-23-and-earlier-schedules-for-dst</a></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:30:36] &lt;rmatte&gt;

then it's good</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:32:11] &lt;bigegor&gt; i've update WMIDataSource on SVN, with support for name spaces other than root/cimv2.

sorry, I just hate badly formatted text, spelling mistakes, and bad grammar in documents :P</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:32:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; me too, I was just reposting the post from March</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:33:10] &lt;rmatte&gt;

:)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:34:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; if you promise not to use your powers for evil, I can probably get you more site privs :P</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:35:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; obviously I wouldn't</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:35:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wouldn't risk losing my Zenoss Master status :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:35:35] &lt;davetoo&gt; Hopefully after I'm done with these firedrills I'll be able to finish up my zenpack ideas, and once I've got those working I'll probably ask for some group privs</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:36:06] &lt;davetoo&gt; because if I can pull off what I want to do with the Cisco stuff, I'll want to brag about it :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:36:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:36:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; what do you hope to do?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:36:57] &lt;davetoo&gt; nestable physical model to parallel their snmp model</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:37:12] &lt;davetoo&gt; and in paralell with that, a simpler logical model to get to the sensors and such</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:37:15] &lt;davetoo&gt; the data</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:37:24] &lt;davetoo&gt; Some of my routers have six CPUs</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:37:46] &lt;davetoo&gt; and later IOS and NX-OS no longer provide that single agreggate CPU load oid</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:38:31] &lt;davetoo&gt; it's going to have a configurable filter to keep only the sensors you want</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:38:49] &lt;davetoo&gt; again some of my boxes have &gt; 120 sensors</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:39:19] &lt;davetoo&gt; don't want that many rrd datapoints :)&#160; although that would be a very nice stress test</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:39:30] &lt;davetoo&gt; 5000 datapoints per chassis?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:40:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; how long is that cloud zenpack contest running for?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:40:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; end of February</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:40:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: nice</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:41:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; customers are eligible to win :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:41:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; davetoo: I want to eventually write a ZenPack for backing up configs from devices, going to start off with IOS</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:41:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: back them up to S3 and you can enter the contest :p</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:42:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: I doubt I'll be able to participate in this one, I don't work with any cloud technologies at all right now</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:42:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I tried to make it broad enough to cover provisioning technologies like puppet and chef</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:42:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: although I'm tempted to take a crack at messing around with Chef</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:42:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; so maybe I can build a pack for Chef somehow</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:43:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I've got suggestions for how it could work if you're interested</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:44:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; fire an email to me with the suggestions :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:44:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; save the email too in case anyone else fancies trying their hand at it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:44:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, I need to setup a test box and actually learn a bit of Chef first</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:45:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well, I've been discussing Puppet ideas, we were going to send a dev to training here in Austin but I don't think we're going to have cycles for it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:45:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I figure Puppet and Chef should be similar</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:45:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; at least in what you'd want to monitor</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:46:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:46:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; Chef is basically the same as puppet, but younger</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:46:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; I like where the project is headed though</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:46:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; feel free to do both :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:47:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have no experience with puppet yet either, but we'll see</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:47:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; I need to decide on one or the other for us to use</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:47:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm leaning towards Chef</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 16:57:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; inbox</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:04:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I was thinking something similar</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:04:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:05:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I'll see what I can put together, but I have a lot to learn to do that by February hehe</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:07:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; anyways, I'm out of here gents</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:07:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; have a good weekend</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:07:36] &lt;suprsonic&gt; thanks for the help rmatte</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:07:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:11:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; looks like Egor checked in some more WMI Data Source stuff: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://zenpacks.zenoss.org/trac-zenpacks/changeset/418">http://zenpacks.zenoss.org/trac-zenpacks/changeset/418</a><span>&#160; I guess I could re-rev the BETA version on the site</span></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:11:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or I can wait for him to say something about it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:32:41] &lt;kobalt&gt; if a bug says maintenace status: Patched does that mean there is a patch out there for it or that its scheduled for a patch?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:35:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; which bug?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:36:24] &lt;kobalt&gt; 5696</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:36:34] &lt;kobalt&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5696">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5696</a></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:36:36] &lt;kobalt&gt; sorry</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:36:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; no problem</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:37:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so the state went from new-&gt;assigned when we reviewed it</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:37:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and accepted it for fixing in 2.5.1</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:38:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; when Ian checked in the fix, it went from "assigned" to "verification" and got marked as "Fixed"</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:38:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; when the backport went in, it moved from "Proposed" to "Patched" for the maintenance release of 2.5.1</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:38:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and when QA checked it off, it went from "verification" to "closed"</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:38:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so this ticket is done and QA has signed off on the fix</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:39:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so to get the fix in 2.5, 'zenpatch 15540'</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:39:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; because you want the 2.5.X version of the fix</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:39:35] &lt;kobalt&gt; woot</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:39:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and that's our convoluted flow :)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:39:48] &lt;kobalt&gt; hehe we use the event view alot</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:39:49] &lt;kobalt&gt; lol</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:40:07] &lt;kobalt&gt; its good to know so I can go through and look at them and understand the process</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:40:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; since we fix it in trunk and in 2.5.X, we have a parallel process</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:40:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; some things get rejected from the stable branch because they're too big</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:40:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so they'll get the 2.5.1 tag removed</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:41:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or moved to 2.5.2 so they have more time to bake if they're significant fixes</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:41:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 2.5.1 will probably be out fairly soon</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:41:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; here are the tickets currently tracking for it: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://tr.im/trac_2_5_1">http://tr.im/trac_2_5_1</a></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:41:45] &lt;kobalt&gt; nice I upgraded to 2.5 went pretty good</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:42:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so looking at that list, only QA can move things from verification to closed</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:43:50] &lt;kobalt&gt; so normally when they are in verification its just waiting on QA</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:45:03] &lt;kobalt&gt; so would it be wise to wait on QA before applying patches?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:46:20] &lt;kobalt&gt; and I found that colors dont work with existing event views after a upgrade</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:48:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; QA has been known to reject a fix, so unless you want to test it you can wait</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:48:07] &lt;rhettardo&gt; so no help on monitoring two devices from the same external IP on two different ports? i.e. host ip of 4.4.4.4 w/ device on port 161 and another on 10000?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:48:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rhettardo: perhaps a command data source?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:49:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobalt: I believe the colors are off by default, but you should be able to turn them on.&#160; If not, please open a ticket</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:49:35] &lt;kobalt&gt; I am opening a ticket now =)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:49:53] &lt;kobalt&gt; you said zenoss:zenoss for the site</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:49:54] &lt;kobalt&gt; ?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:50:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobalt: it works for me....</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:50:30] &lt;kobalt&gt; I had existing event views before the upgrade</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:50:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Configure-&gt;Show severity row colors?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:50:43] &lt;kobalt&gt; any views I recreate do not show colors</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:50:48] &lt;kobalt&gt; err do</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:50:56] &lt;kobalt&gt; if I make a new one it works</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:51:17] &lt;kobalt&gt; but if it was an existing setup then upgrade it does not =)</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:51:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobalt: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://imagebin.org/69819">http://imagebin.org/69819</a><span> like that?</span></span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:53:17] &lt;Skaag&gt; are there more product types than the ones that come built-in, that I can import?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:53:30] &lt;Skaag&gt; like IBM Servers, and HP Switches?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:55:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can add more and some ZenPacks include them</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:55:54] &lt;kobalt&gt; mrayzenoss: zenpatch 15540</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:55:56] &lt;kobalt&gt; err</span><br/><span><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:56:02] &lt;kobalt&gt;

hehe</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:56:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm still running off an RC</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:56:26] &lt;kobalt&gt; =)</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:56:30] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; is that with all browsers?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:56:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or at least more than 1?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:56:47] &lt;kobalt&gt; just Firefox I can test in chrome also</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:57:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so Event Console is OK, but Event Views aren't?</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:57:16] &lt;kobalt&gt; correct</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:57:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'll get Ian on the ticket as soon as it comes in, likely it was fixed in the Event Console and missed the Views</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:57:57] &lt;kobalt&gt; same thing in chrome</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:57:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; include the image in the ticket please</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:58:06] &lt;kobalt&gt; I will</span><br/><span> [30-Oct-2009 17:58:12] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;
