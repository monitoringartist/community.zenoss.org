because the problem seems to be that the skins not correct registered in Zope since update to 2.5.1</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 08:26:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; has Zope been restarted?</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 08:26:53] &lt;Troubadix09&gt;

of course, tr.im has been a bit flakey at times</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 08:45:51] &lt;devnet&gt; ahh</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 08:48:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we used bit.ly for a link to the tickets for a previous release, then we had to change the URL on trac because we renamed the release from a code name to a number&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; so the bit.ly URL didn't work anymore</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:17:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Troubadix09: on the VMware Machines ZenPack, does it not work?&#160; I saw the error when I installed the ZenPack, but it seems to be installed</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:27:59] &lt;Troubadix09&gt;

is there a main pid i can monitor with monit to ensure zenoss is up, or do i need to monitor each pid and set individual service monitors?</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:34:28] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; mrayzenoss: can you reproduce the issue?</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:34:43] &lt;zenethian&gt; in $ZENHOME/zenoss/var there are a lot of pidfiles you can watch.&#160; There isn't really a "main" one because Zenoss runs as a set of components.&#160; The important ones to watch, I suppose, would be zenhub and ZEO, if you wanted to narrrow it down.</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:39:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I reproduced the skins issue, don't have access to an ESX server to test against right now</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:50:18] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; mrayzenoss: thanks a lot. how this is actually governed? is it the task of the ZenPack-Developer to adapt a ZenPAck to a new Zenoss-Version or are they tested by the zenoss-team?</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:51:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; for now it's governed by the Community</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:51:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I mean, there are 120+ Community ZenPacks, many of which don't get tested at all</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:51:47] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; ahh, o.k.,</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:52:01] &lt;Guest6602&gt; zenethian: thanks, i'll give those a shot</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:52:05] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so when someone finds an issue, they can raise it with me or on the ZenPacks forum or on the ZenPack page.&#160; If someone is inclined, they can fix it</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:52:30] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Guest6602: and the zopectl PID since that's the UI</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:54:50] &lt;Troubadix09&gt; mray: hen stroked my last comments about handling ZenPacks in new Versions in the posting</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 10:55:23] &lt;Troubadix09&gt;

is this a production box?&#160; Can you drop your events?</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:02:15] &lt;kisielk&gt; yeah it is production</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:02:20] &lt;kisielk&gt; but I guess I could make a copy of it or something</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:02:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the Event Console working for individual devices makes it sound like the events from a particular device are causing the issue</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:02:25] &lt;kisielk&gt; run it in a VM</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:02:37] &lt;kisielk&gt; yah that's what I was hypothesizing as well</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:02:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; breaking the global event console, but not the individual box</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:02:52] &lt;kisielk&gt; the question is how to find those events</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:02:54] &lt;kisielk&gt; or the device</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:03:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well, from the Device List page you can see all devices with issues&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; you could check each, depending on the size of your network</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:03:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and then you'd only have to delete the offending ones</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:03:38] &lt;kisielk&gt; yeah, that might take a while</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:03:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ok, you can also view events by Device Class</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:04:12] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you could narrow it down possibly that way</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:04:32] &lt;kisielk&gt; hm good idea</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:04:39] &lt;kisielk&gt; binary search</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:04:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, start with /Devices just to verify it's broken</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:05:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it should be, since it's the same as the Event Console</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:05:18] &lt;kisielk&gt; yeah</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:05:21] &lt;kisielk&gt; something in /Servers</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:06:30] &lt;kisielk&gt; hm funny</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:06:35] &lt;kisielk&gt; I narrowed it down to a device class</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:06:41] &lt;kisielk&gt; that has 5 machines</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:06:46] &lt;kisielk&gt; the event console for the class doesn't work</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:06:49] &lt;kisielk&gt; but the individual machines do</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:06:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; weird</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:06:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; deleted device?</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:07:07] &lt;kisielk&gt; that could be</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:07:31] &lt;kisielk&gt; but unlikely</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:07:37] &lt;kisielk&gt; since I don't think we've removed any of these</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:08:14] &lt;kisielk&gt; actually, multiple classes have the same problem</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:08:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; dang</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:09:38] &lt;kisielk&gt; but not all</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:10:31] &lt;kisielk&gt; but yeah, in all the cases, it seems that the individual devices are fine</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:10:31] &lt;kisielk&gt; b</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:10:36] &lt;kisielk&gt; ut viewing the console for the group doesn't work</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:14:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well, it might be easier to drop the rows in mysql and see if it comes back</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:14:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the encoding switched between 2.4 and 2.5 with the Zope upgrade</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:14:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and it's been causing all sorts of weird issues</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:15:25] &lt;kisielk&gt; hm okay</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:15:30] &lt;kisielk&gt; so I want to drop stuff from "detail" ?</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:15:55] &lt;kisielk&gt; at this point I don't really care about event history I think, I just want it to work</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:15:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you could start with that and see if the console works back</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:17:20] &lt;kisielk&gt; what's the username for the mysql user?</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:17:35] &lt;kisielk&gt; ah ok, it's just root</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:22:54] troy-_ is now known as troy-</p><p>[01-Dec-2009 17:59:07] &lt;kisielk&gt;

I guess I don't understand how a separate network with different addresses would draw any different than say another vlan or subnetwork</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:31:57] &lt;twm1010&gt; as long as it understands the topology from the routing tables, that should be it?</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:32:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; zenoss doesn't do layer 2, it does layer 3</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:34:51] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; twm1010: ok so the answer is no</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:35:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; As far as the network map, you can go into networks, and there is a zproperty you can modify for whether it draws lines or not</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:35:28] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; what I want to do is ping the ip of a layer 2 switch if it down all the device connected to that switch ( hard coded ) are considered dead</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:36:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; so you get 1 alert instead of 20?</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:36:41] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; yup</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:36:48] &lt;twm1010&gt; i bet you could do it with a transform</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:37:12] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; twm1010: yeah that could work</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:37:25] &lt;twm1010&gt; so like, if a ping down event comes in for the device, and the device belongs to a location/group/system or any other organizer, it would check to see if the status of device X is down, and drop events accordingly</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:37:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; makes sense to me, there are a few examples out their of event supression by location</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:37:57] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; yeah just use a group for every switch</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:38:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; don't see why you couldn't do it for a group</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:38:16] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; I liked the nagios way with depends of services and parents thou</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:38:28] &lt;tehhobbit&gt;

but i still get alerts that processes are down despite the fact that a system is down</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:38:45] &lt;tehhobbit&gt; but imitaiting nagios when it comes to this will take som work</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:38:59] &lt;twm1010&gt;

no I was thinking about fixing sync and depends</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:40:14] &lt;twm1010&gt; oh :) yeah... i let the real gurus do that stuff, i'm just a wannabe :)</p><p>[02-Dec-2009 08:40:33] &lt;twm1010&gt;

This would be the value that you set when you enable/disable an interface on the device itself.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:45:34] &lt;cluther&gt; So Zenoss would only monitor the interfaces that "should be" used.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:46:34] &lt;ckrough&gt; Is that the current behavior?</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:47:09] &lt;cluther&gt; Making the monitoring of an interface dependent on being adminStatus up is the behaviour on 2.5. operStatus was used prior to 2.5.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:47:20] &lt;ckrough&gt; OK, so from Jane's experience I gather that Zenoss was now monitoring every interface regardless of admin or oper status.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:47:29] &lt;ckrough&gt; Which would obviously lead to a big increase in disk IO</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:47:46] &lt;cluther&gt; That shouldn't be the case. Only admin up interfaces should be monitored.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:48:23] &lt;cluther&gt; Maybe this is just the perceived behavior when no interfaces are set admin down?</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:48:32] &lt;ckrough&gt; I guess it's typical practice to leave access switch ports admin up in most places. That's definitely not the recommended way to do it.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:49:33] &lt;cluther&gt; Yeah.. in a controlled environment it is common for unused ports to be disabled. Unfortunately not everyone gets to live in a controlled environment. :)</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:50:00] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; not quite - on my switches, AdminStatus is Up on all ports&#160; - and this is now the decision criteria for "do I collect perf data"</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:50:06] &lt;cluther&gt; My bet was that large environments with a lot of interfaces being collected would lean towards the controlled side.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:50:13] &lt;ckrough&gt; cluther: yes</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:50:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; We leave all ports up, we simply don't connect patch cables until needed</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:50:37] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; we have lots of switches that are not fully populated</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:51:00] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; and which have lots of PCs attached that get switched off for 16 hours per day</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:51:09] cgibbons_ is now known as cgibbons</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:51:18] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; so we are gathering huge amounts of data that are not required</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:52:54] &lt;cluther&gt; Jane: That's part of the problem with using operStatus as the qualifier too. The way that previously worked by using operStatus as the flag would be very indeterminate in what was monitored and when.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:53:32] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; we are also using the collection of OperStatus in the template and driving /Status/IpInterface events based on that</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:53:34] &lt;cluther&gt; Using the 16 hours off PC scenario as an example, that port would maybe be monitored a couple of days out of the week depending on when zenmodeler ran and if the PC was connected and on at that time.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:54:11] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; so, I guess, we wnat to check the ifOperStatus every perf interval but then use the ifOperStatus value to decide</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:54:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; Why not have a zProperty that determines whether interfaces are modeled or explicit</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:54:30] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; whether to gather perf data from the port</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:54:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; In Solarwinds... I have to be explicit, and tell it what to monitor</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:55:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; To a point, I like that, for my networking equipment, but not for my servers</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:55:55] &lt;twm1010&gt; I filter out a TON of interface names and types, and on many switches, there really are only four or five interfaces out of 200+ that I care about.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:57:01] &lt;twm1010&gt; so... if there was a simple setting that says for a class, all ports are not monitored by default</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:57:07] &lt;twm1010&gt; that would work for me</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:57:11] &lt;ckrough&gt; I like that idea</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:57:21] &lt;cluther&gt; twm1010: You could just remove the InterfaceMap modeler plugin for that class.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:57:30] &lt;ckrough&gt; Im mainly concerned with the aggregation level stuff where are thousands of potentiolly unused interfaces</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:57:58] &lt;ckrough&gt; our policy is to have then 'shut', but having the option to control the behavior based on class would be good</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:58:17] &lt;cluther&gt; I think Jane's idea of only writing out performance data if the interface is currently operationally up is interesting.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:58:23] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; cluther - but then you wouldn't see the existence of those ports - it;s the perf data collection that we'd like to toggle</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:58:40] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; not the fundamental config data - the config data we want</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:58:41] &lt;cluther&gt; The only downside to it that I see would be interfaces that go up and down very frequently.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:59:00] &lt;twm1010&gt; well right now perf data is only collected if the monitor flag is set</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:59:09] &lt;twm1010&gt; could you not also have it hing on operStatus ?</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 08:59:14] &lt;twm1010&gt; *hinge</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 09:00:03] &lt;cluther&gt; I think you could as long as it was the current operStatus and not the modeled value.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 09:00:28] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; I had wondered about writing a little script that set the Monitor flag to Disabled if ifOperStatus for an interface was down</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 09:00:31] &lt;twm1010&gt; sure, otherwise you're at the mercy of the polling cycle</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 09:00:51] &lt;twm1010&gt; Jane_Curry: I believe an event transform exists for that.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 09:02:12] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; I have the event transform for dropping events based on ifOperStatus down from selected regex interfaces</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 09:02:37] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; but I haven't found one that sets monitoring disabled for those interfaces</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 09:03:38] &lt;Jane_Curry&gt; I definitely like the change in 2.5 to CHECK the oper status every perf cycle, rather than having to wait for a modeler cycle or device remodel</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 09:05:24] &lt;twm1010&gt; cluther: As for removing the modeler plugin, I still want it to model, I just don't want it to set monitor to true for anything, I want to be explicit about it.</p><p>[15-Dec-2009 09:05:35] &lt;cluther&gt; Jane: It sounds like a good improvement to me.

where would that gif be physically, in the zopectl database?</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:31:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmmm, bizarre, had a memory threshold kick off at 49% utilization when it was set for 90</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:31:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I believe it's stored in the database itself</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:34:47] &lt;rwrdb&gt; which would be the $ZENHOME/var/data.fs ?</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:34:55] &lt;rwrdb&gt; s/data/Data</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:35:16] &lt;rmatte&gt;

honestly, I'd recommend moving from the appliance to a proper Linux install</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:40:22] &lt;jrock2004&gt; So I enable SNMP in my cisco switches. Now I see in the os tabs my switch ports.

I not big on switches</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:41:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; rwrdb: I'm using Ubuntu Server and it's been working flawlessly, so either that or some Red Hat based Linux</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:41:52] &lt;jrock2004&gt; twm1010: Yeah I been clicking on them and see that. Wondering if I could make a custom graph that shows them all</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:42:05] &lt;rwrdb&gt; k.&#160; I use FreeBSD 99% of the time and know it can work on FreeBSD but I'll probably have to go with a Linux distro.</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:42:32] &lt;rwrdb&gt; Assuming I need to bring up a 2.4.4 install on Linux and move the data over, then attempt upgrade there?</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:42:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; jrock2004: beyond monitoring/graphing traffic you can set Zenoss up to poll interface status, though that'll tell you when ports go up or down, so on a switch with lots of PCs attached to it, it might not be such a great idea</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:43:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; rwrdb: that would be the best route, or a 2.4.5 install</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:43:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; rwrdb: anything 2.4.x</p><p><span>[21-Dec-2009 12:44:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; rwrdb: quite honestly though, I'd recommend that you simply install 2.4.5, apply the following patches: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="DOC-4434.html">docs/DOC-4434</a></p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:44:04] &lt;jrock2004&gt;

rmatte: yeah my cisco switches are not reporting memory</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:48:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; jrock2004: yeh, I had to customize the default cisco templates</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:48:59] &lt;jrock2004&gt; I have my cisco switches under /Netwrok/Switch</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:49:19] &lt;jrock2004&gt; Maybe I should move them under cisco</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:49:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; mine are under /Network/Switch/Cisco</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:49:47] &lt;rmatte&gt;

do I need those mibs?</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:53:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you want to translate traps from Cisco devices then yeh</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:53:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; that ZenPack is a beast though, takes 5 to 7 hours to install</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:54:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you need to issue the 2 zendmd commands listed on the ZenPack page after it's installed</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:54:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; otherwise the UI becomes slooooowwwwww</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:54:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's a great pack to have installed</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:55:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; it saves a lot of hassle of figuring out how to actually install the Mibs yourself</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:55:26] &lt;jrock2004&gt; well it appears that the oid you listed above does not show in my cisco switch</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:55:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; which took me like 8 hours combined to figure out</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:55:46] &lt;rmatte&gt;

the reason grep wouldn't work is because snmpwalk partially translates the OIDs</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:57:33] &lt;jrock2004&gt; ah</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:57:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; you would have had to add -On to the snmpwalk line for it to work</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:57:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; and even then, why walk the entire snmp tree when you can tell snmpwalk specifically what values to walk</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:59:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, if you do the threshold for memory the way that I said above, you'll want to put the following transform under /Perf/Memory...</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 12:59:36] &lt;rmatte&gt;

It just makes it so that the threshold messages come in with an actual percentage rather than a byte value</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 13:00:41] &lt;jrock2004&gt; ok I am just looking on what template to add the oid too</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 13:00:55] &lt;jrock2004&gt; right now the switches are bound to the Device template</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 13:01:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I modified the Device template, yeh</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 13:01:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should already have the CPU value</p><p>[21-Dec-2009 13:01:45] &lt;jrock2004&gt;

and it automatically makes the current datapoint the first item</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:24:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you'd probably want to add 1 the first datapoint again (pretty sure you can add duplicates but you'd have to check) then make it last in the sequence</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:24:13] &lt;theacolyte&gt;

you should be able to</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:26:30] &lt;theacolyte&gt; sure, but man that's weird</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:26:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; it won't be in a second when you understand why you're doing it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:26:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; just add it and I'll walk you through it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:26:48] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Ok, now I have Size2</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:27:00] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Size, FreeSpace,Size2</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:27:06] &lt;rmatte&gt;

That's almost like old HP business calculators</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:19] &lt;theacolyte&gt; actually, it is</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:20] &lt;theacolyte&gt; RPN</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're essentially doing: size,freespace,-</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:22] &lt;theacolyte&gt; duh.</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:26] &lt;theacolyte&gt; right it's RPN haha</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is the same as size - freespace</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:29] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I recognize it now</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, RPN took me a while to get my mind wrapped around it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:39] &lt;theacolyte&gt; the 60's called, they want it back</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:51] &lt;theacolyte&gt; holy crap, that's awesome</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:29:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm pretty sure it's because RRD insists on using it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:30:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I could be wrong</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:30:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; it eliminates the need for brackets though, which makes it a lot easier to not make mistakes (once you actually understand the damn formatting)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:30:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; I thought I understood it a while back, so I helped someone with doing a temperature conversion only to find out that what I thought was right was very wrong</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:30:59] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Still a broken image for the graph, I still havent' figured out the rhyme or reason for it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:31:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I ended up learning it properly hehe</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:31:03] &lt;theacolyte&gt; haha</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:31:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; broken image?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:31:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; clear your browser cache</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:31:56] &lt;theacolyte&gt; nothin</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:32:11] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I find that if I restart the stack it usually fixes it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:32:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's really strange, I've never seen that issue</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:33:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I've been using Zenoss for over a year now</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:33:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; you using 2.5.1?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:33:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; could be a new bug or something, I'm not upgrading to 2.5 until more things get fixed in it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:33:34] &lt;theacolyte&gt; 2.5.1</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:33:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:33:50] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I've been using it for 4 days</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:33:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:33:59] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah it's still a broken image</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:34:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm still on 2.4.5 with a bunch of patches that I dug up over time</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:34:08] &lt;theacolyte&gt; maybe it hasn't collected data?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:34:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's working flawlessly with the patches</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:34:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it hadn't collected data you'd see the graph with "nan" as the values</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:34:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; or you'd see a missing RRD message on the graph</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:35:30] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I just tried to increase the width, and maybe regen it, no go</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:35:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:35:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could always try logging in as the Zenoss user, navigating to $ZENHOME/perf/Devicename</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:36:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; and remove the RRD file for that graph</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:36:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should regenerate</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:36:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; provided it is actually an RRD issue that should fix it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:36:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; it could be something else though</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:36:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you only having the issue with 1 specific graph?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:37:01] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I see what happend I think</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:37:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:37:24] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I messed up the naming and renamed logical to physical and then created over it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:37:29] &lt;theacolyte&gt; and it never remade the rrd files it looksl ike</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:37:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:37:42] &lt;theacolyte&gt; just deleted all the rrd's</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:37:45] &lt;theacolyte&gt; how do you regen?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:37:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should do it itself</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:38:00] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I get the feeling I may need to recreate all this if it's still wrong... database thing</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:38:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; after max of 5 mins (next polling cycle)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:38:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you should see "nan" for 2 more polling cycles until 3 have completed (about 15 mins)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:38:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you'll start seeing values</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:38:49] &lt;theacolyte&gt; got it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:38:55] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I can tell you that for developing that can be painful</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:38:56] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hehe</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:39:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:40:28] &lt;theacolyte&gt; heh it recreated the rrd's fine</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:40:33] &lt;theacolyte&gt; but still broken image</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:40:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; good</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:40:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; hymmm</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:40:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm*</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:40:50] &lt;theacolyte&gt; could it be a problem with that rpn?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:40:54] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'm missing an RRD for used</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:40:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; as zenoss user try zenoss stop then zenoss start</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:40:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; see if that fixed it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:40:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; fixes*</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:41:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; you won't get an RRD for used</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:41:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; as far as I'm aware</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:41:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just values graphed based on calculations between those 2 RRDs</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:42:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; let me double check though</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:42:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you won't get an rrd for that</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:43:30] &lt;theacolyte&gt; wow, just got a ton of errors doing zenoss start</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:43:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's generally not a good sign</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:43:40] &lt;theacolyte&gt; mainly because I ran it as user zenoss</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:43:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; what kinds of errors?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:43:47] &lt;theacolyte&gt; permissions</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:43:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; pastebin them please</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:43:54] &lt;theacolyte&gt; python egg cache directory</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:44:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you did the restart as the zenoss user?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:44:04] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:44:11] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I usually do a zenoss-stack restart as root</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:44:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; pastebin the errors please</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:44:27] &lt;theacolyte&gt; sure, it's the same for all the daemons, so I'll pastebin one</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:44:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't bother with zenoss-stack... that restarts MySQL too, which is not necessary</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:44:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenoss stop and zenoss start is quicker</p><p><span>[22-Dec-2009 18:45:00] &lt;theacolyte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.com/m24adceef">http://pastebin.com/m24adceef</a></p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:45:08] &lt;theacolyte&gt; that repeats for all of them</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:45:10] &lt;adytum-bot&gt; Title: pastebin - collaborative debugging tool (at pastebin.com)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:45:27] &lt;theacolyte&gt; wow zenoss din't come up either</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:45:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; what the heck is /home/administrator ?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:45:54] &lt;theacolyte&gt; it's the home folder for my user</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:46:01] &lt;theacolyte&gt; why... no idea</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:46:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, now the real question is, why does Zenoss know about it?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:46:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you running the VMWare Appliance thingy?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:46:40] &lt;theacolyte&gt; No</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:46:43] &lt;theacolyte&gt; ubuntu</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:46:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, then it's something you've done</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:46:49] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I restarted the whole thing, same broken image</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:47:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; what kind of work have you done from /home/administrator?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:47:08] &lt;theacolyte&gt; nothing</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:47:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you perhaps link a zenpack directory from there?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:47:12] &lt;theacolyte&gt; installed it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:47:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; but with the --link flag?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:47:29] &lt;theacolyte&gt; in fact there are no files in there zenoss related</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:47:32] &lt;theacolyte&gt; no</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:47:36] &lt;theacolyte&gt; just installed the stack</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:47:54] * rmatte scratches his head</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:48:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; you are working on creating custom zenpacks right?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:48:12] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Yeah, but I'm starting with templates, first</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:48:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so do you have any ZenPacks installed at all?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:48:40] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I figured out what it is.</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:48:46] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I won't tell you what it is though.</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:48:51] &lt;theacolyte&gt; :'(</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok hold on</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:06] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Essentially, I'm an idiot</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; when you became the zenoss user, how did you go about doing it?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:11] &lt;theacolyte&gt; ( the b lank user)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:16] &lt;theacolyte&gt; sudo -u zenoss</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; you had the wrong environment variable obviously</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; PYTHON_EGG_CACHE</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to do sudo su - zenoss</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; (ideal method)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:44] &lt;theacolyte&gt; ah, see, I don't know enough about *nix</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; otherwise the environment variables aren't assumed</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:46] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'm a windows guy!</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; just remember, sudo su - zenoss</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:49:59] &lt;theacolyte&gt; So anyway, the graph issue was embarassing</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:50:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; what was it?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:50:19] &lt;theacolyte&gt; So.. as it turns out... datapoints are case sensitive....</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:50:25] &lt;theacolyte&gt; facepalm</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:50:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, very case sensitive</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:50:39] &lt;theacolyte&gt; That's the last time I'm making that mistkae, no worries</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:50:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; remember, you're working with Linux</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:50:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; everything is case sensitive</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:50:53] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah, that was more sarcasm than anything</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:51:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; case is not the same as Case or cAse or caSe or casE or CASE or CaSe</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:52:31] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Man, that's embarassing</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:52:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:52:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh well, don't beat yourself up over it :P</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:52:56] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'm being a little ambitious by doing this, this early on, but in order to get it adopted I need to rival SCOM or other paid tools</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:53:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've been using unix since I was 14 years old, so it comes naturally to me</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:53:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:53:09] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Opposite for me and Windows</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:53:13] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'm a windows server guy</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:53:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I have experience with windows server too</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:53:25] &lt;theacolyte&gt; It's funny, because I'm not a windows desktop person</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:53:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I really shine when it comes to linux</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:53:38] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I love it so much I'm a staff member of ##windows/##windows-server</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:53:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:53:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I use Linux on the desktop with a windows VM (at work and at home)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:53:57] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hah, these days I'm trying to get more into infrastructure - virtualiztion - just got my vmware certification</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:54:08] &lt;theacolyte&gt; What do you use for VMs?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:54:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool, I work with ESX all the time</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:54:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; we're actually patching 2 of our ESX blades tonight (the ones that my 13 Zenoss boxes run on)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:54:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hope nothing crashes and burns</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:55:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't feel like spending the holidays in here rebuilding our monitoring environment</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:55:11] &lt;theacolyte&gt; 13.... zenoss boxes?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:55:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, we're an MSP</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:55:22] &lt;theacolyte&gt; How big is your infrastructure?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:55:23] &lt;theacolyte&gt; ah</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:55:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I have 3 boxes that monitor multiple small clients</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:55:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; then the rest are each dedicated to a client</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 18:55:39] &lt;rmatte&gt;

?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:04:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, that's why when I created my windows SNMP performance zenpack I had to create device groups for multi-cpu boxes</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:05:06] &lt;theacolyte&gt; holy moly........</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:05:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; like /Server/Windows/1 Processor, 2 Processors, ... 16 Processors</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:05:14] &lt;theacolyte&gt; that's no good actually</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:05:22] &lt;theacolyte&gt; so it's actually impossible to do this as a zenpack</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:05:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; and create a template for each</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:05:28] &lt;theacolyte&gt; unless _total exists</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:05:33] &lt;theacolyte&gt; wow that's a big limitation</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:05:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's why I was saying, if you can get it to do a total that would work a lot better</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:05:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; agreed</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:05:50] &lt;theacolyte&gt; well, that goes as #1 feature request for me</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:06:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; the other major limitation is that templates can't inherit just a single setting from a parent template</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:06:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's all or nothing</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:06:17] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah I noticed that</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:06:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; If they were to fix those 2 it would be much more powerful</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:06:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; but in all honesty, it's quite decent compared to other stuff that I've seen</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:08:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, other than those 2 limitations the template system is actually quite powerful</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:08:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I haven't found anything else that isn't possible</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:09:39] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hmmm</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:09:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; (well, I've figured out how to do stuff that I used to think was impossible hehe)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:09:58] &lt;theacolyte&gt; well, good to know about them though, I would have gone off on a tangent hehe</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:10:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:11:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; when you poll it without total does it return more than one value?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:12:14] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:12:15] &lt;theacolyte&gt; it'</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:12:20] &lt;theacolyte&gt; it'll do like:</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:12:31] &lt;theacolyte&gt; 100mb, 100mb, C, 50mb</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:12:39] &lt;theacolyte&gt; 100mb, 13mb, D, 32mb</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:12:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; gotcha</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:13:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only way that I can think of to do the total would be to use a command based datasource and have the script handle the addition before passing the value on to Zenoss, but that's a bad way of doing it since if the command fails a "Command failed" event gets generated which would display the username and password in plaintext</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:13:49] &lt;theacolyte&gt; How would someone monitor disk free without specifying disks?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:14:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can't really actually</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:14:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you could, you'd have to write a collector plugin</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:14:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is very advanced stuff</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:15:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can always monitor disk usage via SNMP though by the way</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:15:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; as long as you don't mind running both WMI and SNMP</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:15:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss is already setup to do that</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:15:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll graph the usage per disk and everything</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:16:04] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:16:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do most of our windows monitoring via SNMP</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:16:16] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'll have to think about it</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:16:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I use WMI for special cases</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:16:20] &lt;theacolyte&gt; run snmp-informant?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:16:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; nope</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:16:27] rhettardo_ is now known as rhettardo</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:16:38] &lt;theacolyte&gt; just regular ol snmp</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:16:40] &lt;rmatte&gt;

though that's in my latest version which isn't release publicly</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:17:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; the current public releases are line graphs instead of area graphs, and the memory was gathered in kilobytes instead of bytes (which I fixed)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:17:56] &lt;rmatte&gt;

hehe</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:18:24] &lt;theacolyte&gt; sorry.. pirate</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:18:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it does it via command based datasources</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:18:42] &lt;theacolyte&gt; ah</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:18:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it uses bash scripts to collect the data (because I haven't converted them to python yet)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:19:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's working well for us</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:20:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; when I add a windows server I just do an snmpwalk for hrProcessorLoad</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:20:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; the amount of lines tells me the number of cpus or cores</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:20:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; then I move it to the appropriate windows group</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:21:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; /Devices/Service/Windows/16 Processors in the case of the screenshot I pasted</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:21:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; but we do it that way since we actually care about each individual core</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:21:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; some people only care about the total, in which case they would use the "simple" version of my ZenPack</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:21:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; which only calculates the total</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:22:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; then they don't have to worry about placing devices in the right groups</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:23:19] &lt;theacolyte&gt; that's pretty slick</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:23:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's decent</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:23:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; it gets the job done</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:23:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:24:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; my boss was impressed with it because there was no way that we'd be able to convince our clients to install informant on every box</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:24:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the WMI Data Source ZenPack didn't even exist at the time</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:25:35] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; enough with the WMI already. :P</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:25:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:26:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hate how microsoft did their SNMP...</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:26:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; you would think that at least the CPU OIDs would remain the same on a server, but I found out that they wander</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:26:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I had the CPUs as datasources initially and just the memory being collected by script</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:26:40] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; yes they tend to take RFC's and then add all their own BS o lock customers in. Kind of like they did with AD vs. LDAP</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:26:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; but the CPU OIDs wander which is so stupid</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:26:54] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; lol</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:26:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; what was .1 yesterday is suddenly .2 and everything else gets shifted down</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:27:01] &lt;theacolyte&gt; wtf?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:27:06] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt;&#160; really</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:27:09] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; that is strange</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:27:15] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; must be by "Design"</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:27:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; the other bonehead thing that they did was that they put virtual memory under the physical drives instead of at the top</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:27:26] &lt;theacolyte&gt; now I'm getting nan's on a graph on another machine that works fine on my first one... and the logical diks graph is working fine?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:27:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the OID for memory changes based on how many physical drives are in each server</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:27:33] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; I am sure MOM/SCOM etc know how to calculate it though. .... NOT</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:27:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; so my scripts dynamically hunt down the correct OIDs per server then gather the data and pass it to Zenoss</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:27:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; works flawlessly</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:28:00] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; geewiz that is horrible</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:28:08] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; is this native SNMP or informant?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:28:17] &lt;theacolyte&gt; ah, on both now - because I'm using C$</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:28:25] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; brb ... time to get off this hard wire and go wireless.</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:28:36] &lt;theacolyte&gt; what happens if you change the datapoint... does it delete the data?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:29:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; native snmp</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:29:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I'm not a fan on installing informant on servers, especially since we wouldn't be able to with half our clients</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:30:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: not sure if it actually deletes the RRD, but it would collect under the new datapoint name from then on</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:30:31] &lt;theacolyte&gt; but the actual performance data itself?</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:30:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; the rrd files are bound to datapoint names</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:30:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, the data would cease to exist</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:30:52] &lt;theacolyte&gt; gt oit</p><p>[22-Dec-2009 19:31:01] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Its normal ?</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:27:43] &lt;coofamani&gt; nephilinturbo: depends on how much stuff you're monitoring and your hardware config</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:27:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; nephilinturbo: well, it depends...</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:27:49] &lt;coofamani&gt; "best hardware" is relative</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:27:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; nephilinturbo: what types of devices and how many?</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:28:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; nephilinturbo: also, disk access speed is a large factor</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:28:35] &lt;coofamani&gt; theacolyte: imgur is fine for me</p><p><span>[23-Dec-2009 12:28:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; nephilinturbo: you may also want to take a look at this: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="DOC-2521.html">docs/DOC-2521</a></p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:29:00] &lt;adytum-bot&gt; Title: Open Source Network Monitoring and Systems Management - How to tweak zenoss (at community.zenoss.org)</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:29:00] &lt;theacolyte&gt; coofamani: bah, you just happened to check it when it came back up</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:29:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; nephilinturbo: though were it talks about the parallel stuff, don't bother with that since the default is 10 and it works better than 2 or 4 or whatever</p><p><span>[23-Dec-2009 12:29:33] &lt;theacolyte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://imgur.com/H4bM7.png">http://imgur.com/H4bM7.png</a></p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:29:35] &lt;theacolyte&gt; How does that look?</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:30:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: very nice</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:30:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; finally got the disk stuff worked out?</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:30:32] &lt;theacolyte&gt; kinda sorta... logical disk I'm just going to add in a monitor for C, and include directions on more drives</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:30:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:30:49] &lt;nephilinturbo&gt; My zenoss server are using 4% CPU and 15%MEM and its always slow</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:30:53] &lt;nephilinturbo&gt; from browser</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:30:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; drive monitoring is really done best via snmp with core anyways</p><p>[23-Dec-2009 12:31:08] &lt;theacolyte&gt; What about connection speed?

you don't like /ignore ?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:21:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; ke4qqq: meh, only noticed that after I added the suppress group, plus we refer to it as "Suppression" so it just makes more sense for management</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:21:54] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Oh</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:22:01] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Oh.</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:22:11] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I will just set everything in Unknown to be history</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:22:20] &lt;theacolyte&gt; (history logs, but doesn't change the status, right?)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:22:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: ummm, that's dumb</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:22:42] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Yes it is</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:22:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: what's the point of even monitoring event log then?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:22:49] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I just don't really want to do it 1 by 1</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:22:50] &lt;theacolyte&gt; lol</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:23:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're going to care about major event log messages indicating things like hardware failures</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:23:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; so don't be lazy, and tune it properly</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:23:19] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yea, yeah</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:23:26] &lt;theacolyte&gt; damn you voice of reason</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:23:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a one time thing (you'll have to tune little things down the road), but it's a lot of work initially</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:23:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; the other option is not to actually do the monitoring via WMI but to do it via SNMP traps which are a little less noisy</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:24:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; but even then you'll have tons of tuning to do since you'll have to write transforms for the traps</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:24:12] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I could do traps</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:24:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's really no way out of it</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:24:18] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Yeah</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:24:20] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I hear ya</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:24:23] &lt;theacolyte&gt; damn this chatty stuff</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:24:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:25:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, servers and network equipment are the equivalent of someone sitting in a room screaming "HELP ME, I'M DYING!" in different tones, and you having to tune it down to the tones that actually indicate that they are dying :)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:25:53] &lt;theacolyte&gt; The beauty of monitoring</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:25:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; The boy who cried wolf, if you will</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:26:03] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:26:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; :)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:26:09] &lt;theacolyte&gt; BEs is like that hardcore</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:26:10] &lt;theacolyte&gt; it's insane</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:26:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:27:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; I assume you meant "BES"?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:27:52] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:27:59] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Blackerry Enterprise BES</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:28:08] &lt;theacolyte&gt; AKA Flaming pile of manure</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:28:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeah, when one of our client's BES servers reboot it generates like 70 to 100 events</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:28:12] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Great when it works though</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:28:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; but we can't tune them out since they are all valid events if they happen on their own</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:28:23] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Oh yeah, nevermind boot - even day to day operation</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:28:44] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Here's question actually</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:29:26] &lt;theacolyte&gt; As far as how you deal with events, do you just acknowledge them, or do you also close them?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:29:31] &lt;theacolyte&gt; And if you close them, where do they go?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:29:45] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I haven't gotten that far</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:29:54] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'm doing this pretty hodge-podge bcause I need up/down ASAP</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:29:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; you don't actually "close" them, you move them to history</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:30:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you have active events, acknowledgement is to acknowledge that you've seen the event and that you are addressing it</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:30:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; moving it to history is essentially marking it as clear</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:30:38] &lt;theacolyte&gt; The button says "Close events"</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:30:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; we work with a ticketing system though, so I barely ever touch the event console anymore</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:30:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, that's the new button</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:30:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that means move to history</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:30:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just been renamed</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:30:59] &lt;theacolyte&gt; So where is histroy located?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:31:07] &lt;theacolyte&gt; nevermind.</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:31:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; look in the bottom left I believe it is now</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:31:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; used to be in the top right</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:31:27] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I really need to delete my history actually</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:31:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can't really</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:31:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless you actually go right in to MySQL</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:32:13] &lt;theacolyte&gt; sigh</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:32:23] &lt;theacolyte&gt; 22k history events already just from adding stuff</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:32:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you just want to mercilessly delete it?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:32:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can click on Event Manager on the left</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:33:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually hold on, wrong spot</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:33:11] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Yeah, I literally have no use for it</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:33:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah nevermind</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:33:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, click Event Manager</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:33:22] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Some of it is events from improperly set up stuff</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:33:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you'll see "Delete Historical Events Older Than (days)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:33:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; change that to 1</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:33:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; and click save</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:33:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll delete any events older than 1 day</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:33:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; then change it to 365 or whatever</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:33:59] &lt;theacolyte&gt;

no</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:34:18] &lt;theacolyte&gt;&#160; I see it, sorry</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:34:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; Event Manager under Management</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:34:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:34:29] &lt;theacolyte&gt; You mean the one that s ays Event Manager</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:34:30] &lt;theacolyte&gt; got it</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:34:35] &lt;theacolyte&gt; lol</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:34:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:35:02] &lt;theacolyte&gt; perfect</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:35:43] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Thanks... yeah, I could care less about history when I'm setting stuff up</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:35:47] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Tabula rasa</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:36:27] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I should probably remember to turn that off</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:36:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:37:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; haven't heard that saying in a while</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:37:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; (Tabula rasa)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:38:09] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; you should add a tabula rasa button to the UI :)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:38:19] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; it really would be very useful for testing</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:38:25] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah, it would</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:38:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it could just link to zenwipe.sh</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:38:31] &lt;theacolyte&gt; would have made this development stuff easier</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:38:38] &lt;theacolyte&gt; oh, there's a zenwipe.sh</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:39:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, apparently egor's pack doesn't remove the heartbeat entry for zenperfwmi when it's removed</p><p><span>[29-Dec-2009 15:39:02] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

If I ever finish</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:41:55] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hehe</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:41:57] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; awesome</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:42:04] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; release early and often :)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:42:07] &lt;theacolyte&gt;

I have availablembytes</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:50:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, so tell me how you can do a percentage threshold with that 1 value</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:50:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; without knowing total memory</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:51:01] &lt;theacolyte&gt;

Does all the historical data go away?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:57:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, I don't think the RRD file gets deleted</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:58:03] &lt;theacolyte&gt; rmatte: To answer your question, you have a point</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:58:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you'd have to add it back with the exact same name to retrieve the data</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:58:12] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Ah, you're right, it's stored in the RRD file... well, those are small</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:58:22] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I was mainly worried about space</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:58:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; RRD files don't grow after they've been created</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:58:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; all historical performance data is stored in RRD files</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:58:42] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:59:12] &lt;theacolyte&gt; To answer your question, I didn't get that far. When I put in AvailbleMBytes I figured I'd just do something like &lt;256mb</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:59:20] &lt;theacolyte&gt; but that's not a great way to do it</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:59:25] &lt;theacolyte&gt; damn your voice of reason again</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:59:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; Total: 1000000000</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:59:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; Used: 700000000</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:59:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; 700000000 * 100 / 1000000000 = 70</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 15:59:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; something like that</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:00:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; your threshold would end up being applied against Used and it would be here.Total * 0.9</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:00:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; for 90%</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:00:35] &lt;theacolyte&gt; That may actually be the only good way</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:00:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, it would be more like: here.getRRDValue('Total')</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:00:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; since you need to retrieve the value from the datapoint for total</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:01:15] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I actually have no idea how to do that.. yet</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:01:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's easy...</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:01:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's whatever you name the datasource</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:01:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; or datapoint rather</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:02:11] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Shit</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:02:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if you name it macdufus it would be here.getRRDValue('macdufus')</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:02:18] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'll hve to rework that</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:02:28] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Can't use available memory anymore, I'll have to derive that #</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:02:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; so: here.getRRDValue('macdufus') * 0.9 would be your threshold max value</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:02:43] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Let's see</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:02:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it would be applied against used memory (you probably want used instead of free</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:02:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; more hassle than it's worth</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:03:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; can you pull available memory from WMI?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:03:14] &lt;theacolyte&gt; used is wayyyy easier to do</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:03:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; erm, used rather</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:03:27] &lt;theacolyte&gt; because I can take used and total and come up with available anyway with my thold</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:03:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, exactly</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:03:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; I never bother with available, I always go total and used</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:04:00] &lt;theacolyte&gt; otherwise it would be something weird like... used - total = -available</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:04:06] &lt;theacolyte&gt; then you'd have to convert that to a real number</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:04:29] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah, that's a pain in the ass, so ... no</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:04:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:04:44] * theacolyte digs in WMI</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:05:28] &lt;theacolyte&gt; pagefaults HAS to be wrong, too</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:05:36] &lt;theacolyte&gt; there's no way this server is having 100k page faults/ sec</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:05:40] &lt;theacolyte&gt; It would explode</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:06:04] &lt;theacolyte&gt; only reaslly care about hard faults anyway</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:06:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it would be more like: (total - available) * 100 / total</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:07:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:09:34] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Where'd you put here.getRRDValue('macdufus') - that's not RPN</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:09:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; no no, that actually goes right in the threshold's max value</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:10:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a python function</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:10:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; you create the threshold</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:10:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; apply the threshold against used</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:10:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; then set the max value as here.getRRDValue('WhateverDatapointYouCreatedForTotalMemory') * 0.9</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:11:36] &lt;theacolyte&gt; oh</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:11:40] &lt;theacolyte&gt; for 90% (obviously)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:11:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; exactly</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:12:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; basically what you're doing it taking the total memory in bytes and multiplying it by 0.9, giving you 90% of the value for total</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:12:16] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I have much to learn</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:12:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; If the value for used matches 90% of total the threshold kicks off</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:12:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, Zenoss is really complex, I've spent a year learning it as best I could</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:12:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know lots of little tricks</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:13:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's very simple to do basic stuff but when you get in to tuning and customization it can get complex quite quickly</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:13:50] &lt;theacolyte&gt; that's what I'm running into now</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:13:58] &lt;theacolyte&gt; wmi stuff is easy, but this starts to get a little more complicated</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:14:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:15:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; I pretty much have template design and event tuning down to a fine science</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:15:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; ;)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:15:32] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Do you work for peantus</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:15:36] &lt;theacolyte&gt; peanuts, rather?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:15:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; Relative to what I should be getting paid, yes</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:15:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:15:57] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Don't we all</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:16:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm still making the same amount as I was when I was a senior network analyst, I haven't been offered a raise or anything</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:17:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; ...and I was the only one willing to take on learning Zenoss, and now we have 13 Zenoss servers and I'm the only person who knows how to manage them</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:17:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:17:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus we have another 2 Zenoss servers on the way soon enough (and lots more after that)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:18:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do all sorts of other oddball stuff like LDAP administration</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:18:45] &lt;theacolyte&gt; how big of a company?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:19:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure what the exact employee count is, it's somewhere between 100 and 300</p><p><span>[29-Dec-2009 16:19:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; This is our website: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.novanetworks.com/">http://www.novanetworks.com/</a></p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:19:40] &lt;adytum-bot&gt;

theacolyte: I actually did that this past year - told them how much zenoss training was in Anapolis - they sent me :)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:26:57] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; rmatte: but that's canadian dollars :)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:27:13] &lt;theacolyte&gt; That's more than most mortgages</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:27:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; ke4qqq: 1,200.00 CAD</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:27:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; =</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:27:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; 1,150.09 USD</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:27:47] * ke4qqq doesn't think $currentdayjob will go for it though.</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:27:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; not much difference</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:28:11] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; nope - /me remembers when it far more significant a difference.</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:28:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I remember times when it was higher than the USD, it fluctuates</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:28:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; but when it's higher it's bad for trade</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:29:00] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I remember taking the ferry from seattle to vancouver, and getting 5 quarters for a US $ and playing lots of video games</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:29:03] &lt;theacolyte&gt; as a kid</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:29:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's basically engineered to be a bit lower</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:29:12] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Which was about 350 years ago</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:29:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: hehe</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:29:43] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I've only been to vancouver/victoria</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:29:48] &lt;theacolyte&gt; never been anywhere east of that</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:29:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it's probably the warmest place in Canada</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:30:07] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hahahahahaha</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:30:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; honestly, it is</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:30:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; BC is way warmer than any other Canadian province</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:31:26] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I believe you</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:31:49] &lt;theacolyte&gt; We have a few people in ##windows-server that are from saskaskaskaskasahdljkasdjasd that constantly talk about how cold it is</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:31:52] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hehe</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:32:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; Heck, already this year Edmonton Alberta saw a record low of -58.4</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:32:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; celsius</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:32:14] &lt;theacolyte&gt;

I think the coldest I've ever been in is maybe -10F in Colorado snowboarding</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:32:57] &lt;theacolyte&gt; And that was cold enough to freeze my camelback in just about 5 minutes</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:33:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; -31 is like -23F</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:33:13] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Man, and that was COLD</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:33:22] &lt;theacolyte&gt; It's a balmy 50 outside</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:33:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; the coldest we usually get here is about -31F</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:33:57] &lt;theacolyte&gt; That's about.. Oh, I'd say 90 degrees too cold for me</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:33:59] &lt;theacolyte&gt; LOL</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:34:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:34:14] &lt;theacolyte&gt; That's one of the reasons why it's so great to live here though... the weather is amazing</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:34:17] &lt;theacolyte&gt; average is like 60</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:34:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's 3F today, but with the wind chill it feels like -22F</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:34:55] &lt;theacolyte&gt; 49 but feels like 46!</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:35:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:35:08] &lt;theacolyte&gt; There's a ginormous rain cloud headed in our direction though</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:35:18] &lt;theacolyte&gt; That will undoubtedly hit as I'm walking out the door</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:35:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; meh, I can deal with rain</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:35:22] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Just in time for the evening commute</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:36:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:36:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I have to walk 10 minutes to the bus in this, in about 20 mins</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:36:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; then take that bus to the first station, wait there for lord knows how long, could be 5 minutes, could be 20, then take the next bus, then walk from there to my place which is about another 10 minutes</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:37:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; winter sucks</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:37:47] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I take the bus myself</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:37:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I think I prefer winter in Austin to summer&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; we had over 60 days over 100</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:37:57] &lt;theacolyte&gt; driving is insane out here</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:38:07] &lt;theacolyte&gt; could take the train, but the bus stops right in front of my house</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:38:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's crazy</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:38:25] &lt;theacolyte&gt; mrayzenoss: 2 years ago I was out there for new years and it was 80</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:38:35] &lt;theacolyte&gt; last new years it was pretty warm too actually</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:38:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; The hottest we get here in summer is like maybe 89.6</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:39:21] &lt;theacolyte&gt; lol</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:39:30] &lt;theacolyte&gt; We hit in the 90's for maybe a week out of the year</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:39:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; we get quite the range, 89.6 in summer, -31 in winter</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:40:01] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I think it was actually 37 outside last night (!)</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:40:09] &lt;theacolyte&gt; which is by far the coldest it gets</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:40:29] &lt;theacolyte&gt; We're like 37-90 and that's in an entire year</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:40:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it was 32F here a couple days ago for 2 days</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:41:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; then it plunged back down to 3</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:41:08] &lt;theacolyte&gt; wow, that sounds downright comfy</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:41:13] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; we rarely get below 20F in SC - and normally live in mid-90's during the summer - so not as extreme as Austin summers but actually get to experience cold in the winters and see snow occasionally.</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:41:16] &lt;theacolyte&gt; snow on the ground and all that?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:41:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you want snow, come and get it, we've got tons</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:41:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:42:16] &lt;theacolyte&gt; It actually snowed here in San Francisco this year</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:42:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, the skating rink right by my place is open, I think I'll go for a skate tonight (if the wind dies down that is</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:42:19] &lt;theacolyte&gt; very, very breifly</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:42:20] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; I didn't say that snow actually made it the ground - just that we saw it - we get maybe one or two occurrences with an inch or two of accumulation - we had 12 inches in the mid-90s and people still remember it.</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:42:42] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I've lived here pretty much all my life and not a single time has the snow stuck</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:42:47] &lt;theacolyte&gt; And it's snowed maybe 4 times</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:42:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; we've had storms where we've been hit with 20 or 30 inches in one go</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:43:08] &lt;theacolyte&gt; lol</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:43:15] &lt;theacolyte&gt; So you have done one thing</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:43:22] &lt;theacolyte&gt; You have convinced me never to move to Canada</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:43:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:43:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; like I said, move to BC and you'd be fine</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:43:47] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'm sure you have some good things though</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:43:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; anywhere else, and you shall be cold</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:43:56] &lt;theacolyte&gt;&#160; DOn't you have those fries with gravy on them?</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:43:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; southern ontario is fairly warm too</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:44:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; poutine, why yes we do</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:44:14] &lt;theacolyte&gt; that's what it is</p><p>[29-Dec-2009 16:44:17] &lt;theacolyte&gt;

OiScout: are you just having issues understanding the instructions?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:01:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprsonic: why do you choose to torture yourself by using Zenoss on FreeBSD when you know that it'll run better on Linux?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:01:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; I mean, I know FreeBSD is superior in some ways to Linux, but come on</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:01:54] &lt;suprsonic&gt; who says it runs better on Linux?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:01:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:02:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a fact that it's easier to install and upgrade on Linux</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:02:19] &lt;suprsonic&gt; darn, wish I could stay, but I have to go watch my son</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:02:26] &lt;suprsonic&gt; this is true rmatte</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:02:32] &lt;suprsonic&gt; thats why I was thinking about ubuntu</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:02:39] &lt;suprsonic&gt; but I see that there isn't a 9.10 version yet</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:02:52] &lt;rmatte&gt;

she has other ones on there too</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:08:59] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; still not sure how I go about including my script in the zenpack though.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:09:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, I can help you with that...</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:09:14] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; my performance collection script that is.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:09:32] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; do I just place it in a special directory under the zenpack?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:09:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, sort of...</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:09:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; ssh and become zenoss user</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:09:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; then navigate to $ZENHOME/ZenPacks</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:10:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; then to ZenPacks.My.Pack/ZenPacks/My/Pack or whatever</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:10:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; (it'll have a folder structure with parts of the ZenPack name, go all the way to the bottom</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:10:52] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; and just put it there?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:10:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; no</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:11:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; create a folder, I call mine libexec usually</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:11:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; mkdir libexec</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:11:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; then put it in there...</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:11:14] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; ok</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:11:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; then in your template, you point to it like:</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:11:26] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; then when I export the .egg it will include it</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:11:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; bah</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:11:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; ${here/ZenPackManager/packs/ZenPacks.Nova.Windows.SNMPPerfMonitor/path}/libexec/wincpu.sh</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:12:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; replace ZenPacks.Nova.Windows.SNMPPerfMonitor with your ZenPack name</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:12:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; and wincpu.sh with the name of your script</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:12:18] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; but the export will contain all files in the zenpacks.my.pack and subdirectories ?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:12:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:12:30] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; cool</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:12:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; that directory IS the ZenPack basically</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:12:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; the Zenoss GUI just makes changes to the files in that directory</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:12:59] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; yep justwas not sure if I had to specify scripts to include</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:13:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; when you export it it zips it up and names it as a .egg</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:13:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you need to point to it in your actual template the way that I showed you</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:14:00] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; got it that way it is a relative path when someone installs it in their environment.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:14:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; correcto</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:15:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; ZenPacks can be a bit of a pain in the rear to work with</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:15:41] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; I think it depends on what level you are trying to create one at.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:16:07] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; the GUI dev piece seems easy enough. but when you want to start adding tabs and modeling devices it gets a little tricky.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:16:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:16:55] &lt;rmatte&gt;

well, you'll be surprised</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:18:31] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; lol</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:18:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've heard it's not as easy as it seems</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:18:51] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt;

we will see.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:22:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've made a daemon ZenPack, that's about the most advanced that I've done</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:22:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I've gotten several submissions for ZenPacks that started with Jane's docs, good stuff</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:23:02] &lt;rmatte&gt;

cool</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:25:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; this one is a big one, because I have 2 servers that I'm still having issues with</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:25:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; so 3 thresholds are being disabled on one and 4 on the other</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 14:26:05] &lt;rmatte&gt;

later</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:16:30] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I am setting up ZenOSS and I seem to have most things working but windows seems to being a pain.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:17:19] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; It keeps reporting snmp is down yet it is pulling down info that it has to be getting from snmp.&#160; What might I being doing wrong.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:17:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's not WMI data?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:18:24] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Maybe?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:18:56] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I am more of a linux admin then a windows one.&#160; Never even heard of WMI until I was setting up ZenOSS.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:20:22] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; SNMP is running on the windows box.&#160; In the correct public group.&#160; OpenNMS was seeing snmp on that box.&#160; Just find opennms very limiting and want to switch to zenoss.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:20:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ok, sounds like SNMP is running properly</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:21:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; from the device that's complaining, you said the SNMP agent was down, has it stayed down?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:22:56] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; If I clear the event.&#160; Run Model Device it seems to run without an error but that check on the system later and there is a new event snmp down.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:23:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; just the one device, or many?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:23:30] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; New Setup</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:23:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so collection works for awhile, then it eventually stops?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:24:10] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I had a test version running that I saw the same thing over several systems but this new box only has 1 windows box setup</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:24:48] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Collection on my Linux boxes aren't showing an issue.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:24:58] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; both ssh and snmp</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:25:18] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I even setup a template for custom postfix monitoring.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:28:12] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; mrayzenoss I am not sure.&#160; From reading over lots of cryptic forum messages is sounds like there are actually 2 grabbers on windows.&#160; WMI and SNMP</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:28:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, WMI grabs the Event Log and Services</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:28:45] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; That data I am seeing.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:29:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so WMI is working for that&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; but do you see other data for your box?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:30:12] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; no</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:30:48] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; So it isn't pulling in snmp data I take it.</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:31:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, sounds like it</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:31:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the device is in /Server/Windows right?</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:31:15] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Yes</p><p>[30-Dec-2009 17:31:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

ke4qqq: native as in the .deb?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:12:47] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; or .rpm</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:13:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; ke4qqq: well, first off, we use Ubuntu Server, so we don't bother with RPM</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:13:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; secondly, the .deb is literally just the stack installer wrapped up in a .deb</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:13:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; and thirdly, the .deb didn't exist back when I did the first installation on our servers, so all we had was the stack</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:13:42] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; ahhh - the rpm isn't....though that's how they used to do it.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:14:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; and honestly, the stack installer works absolutely flawlessly</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:14:05] * ke4qqq likes native package - makes config management far easier</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:14:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never had an issue installing or upgrading with it</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:14:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss is the absolute last thing that I'd want automated config management taking care of</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:15:25] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; I just fear the repercussions of shipping soooooo many packages in the stack installer and then relying on Zenoss to issue an updated package everytime a security vulnerability was found.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:15:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss relies on very specific versions of packages, so that's not even an issue</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:16:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're not going to see security patches for Python 2.4</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:16:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:16:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, there are, it's called Python 2.6</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:16:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; same goes for Zope</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:16:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; MySQL is the exception</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:17:08] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; really - I love using config management as it makes setting up a test system REALLY easy- provision a new machine and tell puppet to add the zenoss class</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:17:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; ke4qqq: I just keep a base VM image up to date, when we want a new Zenoss server it's as simple as cloning a VM, booting it up, changing /etc/hostname, /etc/hosts and /etc/network/interfaces and then rebooting</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:18:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; takes about 5 minutes to do</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:18:29] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; thats not bad</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:18:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; we have lots of customizations on the image that couldn't be handled by config management (well, not without a lot of time packaging stuff up)</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:21:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, time to order a new power supply for my home computer...</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:24:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; although, with what I know about Zenoss now I wish we could go back and start from scratch</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:24:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; things would move along much more swiftly/efficiently</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:29:49] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; rmatte: I have had the fortune of spending time learning with my last $dayjob and doing a lot of things differently since I started at $newdayjob - but it's slow going, monitoring was non-existent when I arrived, and we only have lip service to its important as far as getting time to work on it.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:30:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:30:07] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; s/important/importance</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:30:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; monitoring is all we do, so there's always something that I need to fix</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:30:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; Right now I'm trying to find the pesky code that's automatically disabling my thresholds due to simple value errors</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:32:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's probably in some obscure file</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:38:58] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; I almost took a job with a service provider that was 90% monitoring, but they already had chosen some horrendous $tool they were having problems with, and they had dress code and schedule issues as well.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:40:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:40:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hate dress code</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:41:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you're going to be sitting around coding/administering stuff all day, you should be comfortable... meaning golf shirt at the most</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:41:25] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; yeah me too - I mean, if people actually see me, you are doing it wrong, or something horrific has happened.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:41:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:42:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; I love the line from the movie Antitrust: "Come on guys, don't you know that the worse you look, the smarter they think you are?"</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:42:35] &lt;etank&gt; heh</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:42:49] * ke4qqq adds that to the list of movies I need to watch</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:43:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's is the single best computer related movie of all time in my opinion</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:44:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; it ranks above wargames and swordfish for me</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 09:44:19] &lt;suprsonic&gt;

nope</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:09:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; if not, click on events on the left and click UPS</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:10:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should see an event mapping called trippUPS1 in there</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:10:30] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; ahh there is an option that says goto event class</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:10:39] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; instead of just clicking on ok</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:10:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:10:52] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; ok</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:10:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so you see the mapping?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:10:59] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; I have that event pulled up now</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:11:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:11:08] &lt;rmatte&gt;

well, hold on</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:12:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to understand how the transform field works</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:12:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; transforms are python scripts</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:12:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the first thing we want to do is extract the tripplite message in to a variable</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:12:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; so add this line:</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:12:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; msg = getattr(evt, 'tripplite', 'Unknown')</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:12:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; then we want to set the event summary to that message, so add this line after it:</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:13:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; evt.summary = '%s' % (msg)</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:13:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; then save the event mapping</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:13:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can also go to zProperties of the event mapping to adjust severity, and a couple other things</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:14:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; do similar for the other trap</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:14:14] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; so those two lines are all that is needed in the transforms filed?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:14:21] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; s/filed/field</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:14:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; in this case, yes</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:15:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; since all you're doing is setting a variable as what the trap is exposing (the tripplite value) then setting the event summary based on that</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:15:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; transforms are extremely powerful though, you can do a heck of a lot more with them than just that, this is just a simple one</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:16:11] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; makes sense. I just did the same for the other event as well.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:16:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:16:22] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; now I need to re-create them again and see how they show up.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:16:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure that the property of the other event is actually called tripplite</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:16:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; it might be called something different</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:16:42] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; it's the same I already checked.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:16:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; k cool</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:16:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, re-create them, you'll see what happens ;)</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:17:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; (your Zenoss will blow up, muahahaha!)</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:17:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; (just kidding)</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:17:22] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; lol</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:17:23] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; brb</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:17:27] &lt;rmatte&gt;

np</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:24:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you can adjust the severity on the zProperties tab for the event mapping (which I assume you've already done)</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:25:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, for the event manager command... you can actually incorporate things dynamically in to the command</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:26:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; For instance:</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:26:22] &lt;rmatte&gt;

anything in ${} can be used</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:26:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can use any event property (the ones you saw earlier in the event details)</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:26:43] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; TALES FTW</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:26:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; just put ${evt/whatever}</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:26:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; case sensitive of course</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:44:44] &lt;aclark&gt; Fuzzy_T: hah</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:45:07] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; huh?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:45:09] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt;

RobertLaptop: what do you mean?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:47:26] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; why use one over the other?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:47:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; RobertLaptop: well, for what type of monitoring, just basic performance like CPU and Memory?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:47:38] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Pretty much.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:47:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; RobertLaptop: You don't need either honestly...</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:47:56] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; RobertLaptop: if you can get away with SNMP informant you want to use SNMP - WMI is far to expensive performance wise.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:47:58] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt;

Yea I am trying to way the diff.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:49:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; Those ZenPacks (which I developed) allow you to do CPU and Memory monitoring of Windows hosts without using snmp informant</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:49:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; how many hosts will you be monitoring?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:49:18] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; I would say SNMP is worth the extra effort up front.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:49:44] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; IMHO</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:49:51] &lt;aclark&gt;

But that could group from there but I have no real budget to buy anything.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:50:38] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; depends on if you have a need for WMI, if you need WMI at all might as well use WMI, if not, SNMP is prolly worth the effort.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:50:50] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; RobertLaptop: no need to buy anything either way</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:50:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; RobertLaptop: really, take a look at my ZenPacks, they'll easily handle that many servers</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:50:57] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Yea.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:50:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ke4qqq: WMI is within an order of magnitude of SNMP in 2.5.x, but yeah, SNMP is faster</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:51:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; RobertLaptop: and the ones that are posted right now are a bit rough, I'm planning to release an update by end of next week, so if you can wait for the update I suggest that you do</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:51:25] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; really - has it improved that much?? I just started setting up my 2.5.x box, but knew it was a bear</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:51:29] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; previously at least.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:51:41] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; rmatte I have looked at several of them.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:52:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ke4qqq: lots of fixes went into making it asynchronous, so it scales a lot better</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:52:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; still chattier on the network than SNMP</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:52:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but it's still really limited in core</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:52:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; can't even do disks and interfaces with it</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:52:53] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I understand outside of going with com. zenoss I am looking a custom montor, wmi, or snmp informat</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:53:08] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; RobertLaptop: for what?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:53:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; RobertLaptop: Zenoss Core is unable to provide complete monitoring with just WMI, so you're going to have to use SNMP one way or another</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:53:37] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; To do basic monitoring of windows machines.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:53:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; RobertLaptop: unless you actually purchase the enterprise version, but you said your budget is virtually non-existant</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:54:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; RobertLaptop: for doing just CPU and Memory performance monitoring you can use my ZenPacks, then you won't have to roll out snmp informant across 50 servers</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:54:56] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Yea.&#160; From reading the forums and what can be checked it looks like most people fall into those 2 camps</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:55:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; Or you can use snmp informant, really up to you</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:56:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; ...but like I said, I'm releasing an update to my ZenPacks by end of next week</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:56:55] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I was wonder is anyone had gone though the process of comparing the two.&#160; Most of what I have found seem to come down to personal profense or what someone came across 1st.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:57:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if you can wait until then I'd suggest you do, the new version is going to be a lot cleaner</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:57:25] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; rmatte I am going though testing several version right now to see how they all work.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:57:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:57:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only way you're going to be able to monitor disks and interfaces is via SNMP</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 14:58:22] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; But you can't always see the little things or the pitfalls that is why I am asking before I commit to one.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:00:04] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; rmatte how is the new version diff from the current version.&#160;

RobertLaptop: hopefully you don't have any servers still running on 2000</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:07:29] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; rmatte half</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:07:35] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; are windows 2000</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:07:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, then you're probably going to have to use WMI or informant, don't really have a choice at that point</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:07:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; not even sure if informant would expose it</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:08:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; might be stuck with WMI for performance and then SNMP for disks and interfaces</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:08:22] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Is we go company wide we have 50 Windows NT boxes I will need to figuire out how to work with. :(</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:08:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, since you have windows 2000 machines, if you're using Zenoss core you're basically stuck with a mix of WMI and SNMP</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:09:29] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Yea I was pretty much plaining that.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:09:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; anyways, I'm heading out, talk to you guys next week</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:09:53] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; have a happy new year rmatte</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:09:53] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Have a nice holiday rmatte</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:09:55] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; wait!</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:10:01] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; rmatte: are you releasing a windowsp ack? :P</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:10:30] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; hehe dman</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:12:04] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; y'know, the map is pretty but it does have one big problem</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:12:16] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; it motivates you to clear your issues so you can get green dots again LOL</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:12:26] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; lol</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:13:39] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; ke4qqq if they have a version that used native packages for debian / ubuntu I would be one of those people but stagging is disconcerting to me and I prefer packaged of compile my own.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:14:03] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; mrayzenoss: ^^</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:14:20] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Yea the green dots on the map can push you to tweak thing to death.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:15:22] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; RobertLaptop: I've been nagging them to actually push into repos. That said - you're probably a masochist for wanting to compile on your own - or a BSD user :) I am thrilled that they have native packages on RHEL/CentOS</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:16:37] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Yea.&#160; I am happy as well.&#160; It might be nice of they had a Yum Repo for updating but that is why I am using centos.&#160; The rest of my Data Center is built on Debian</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:17:29] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; the yum repo isn't a bad idea - probably even has upsides for Zenoss.</p><p><span>[31-Dec-2009 15:18:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/yum/">http://dev.zenoss.org/yum/</a></p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:18:41] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; Man, this is weird</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:18:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that appears to be missing from the Installation Guide...</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:18:48] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; If you make a location, say, with the name of a city</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:19:03] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; want a bug filed for it?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:19:05] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; And then assign your offices as a sublocation to that location</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:19:14] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; IT only seems to show one office...</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:19:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ke4qqq: yeah, that'll save me the time.&#160; Sev 3 Doc bug</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:19:24] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; ok</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:19:29] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; at least it only does that for Portland, OR</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:19:34] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; maybe Zenoss doesnt' like Portland?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:19:45] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; theacolyte-: sounds likely</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:19:57] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; theacolyte-: does each of the locations have a separate address</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:20:00] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Yea it is.&#160; Good to know.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:20:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; theacolyte-: depending on the map, it's only going to show 1 level of the hierarchy</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:20:23] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; Main location has no address, sub locations do</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:20:28] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; So I have Portland, and in that my offices</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:20:38] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; And they are all near eachother (like walking distance)</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:20:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; main location needs an address</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:20:50] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; works for san francisco though</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:20:53] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I have seen that as well I create sub groups for states but then the map did show any</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:20:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and it'll graph and roll-up the sub-location events</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:21:05] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; *didn't</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:21:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you have to have an address in every level of the location</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:21:17] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; Well, I'm trying to do 2 portlets, one for san francisco, and one for portland so I can see individual offices</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:21:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; theacolyte-: that should work</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:21:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so if you go to /Locations/ you won't see anything, but /Locations/Portland you'll see the sub-locations with addresses</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:22:03] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; I'm doing a base location of Portland (the main location container) without an address</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:22:06] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; right</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:22:16] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; mrayzenoss so if I create a Group Call CA and had an address in CA the map would show 1 dot for CA or 4 dots 1 for group CA and 3 for each office in CA?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:22:16] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; The sublocaitons have an address</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:22:23] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; but only 1 of the addresses is showing up on the map</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:22:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; RobertLaptop: if you're at the top-level of 'Locations", you'll see 1 dot</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:22:44] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; even went so far as to zoom all the way out</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:23:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; RobertLaptop: if you go to /Locations/CA you'll see 3</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:23:17] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; OK.&#160; That I guess I will have to think about then.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:23:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; some people flatten their hierarchies because of that</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:24:56] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; For now I have it flatted but we have 70 sites in 30+ states and CA.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:25:15] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; So breaking it down into states might make sense</p><p><span>[31-Dec-2009 15:26:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; someday you'll have pretty graphs like rmatte: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dmon.org/graphics/zenoss/gen2.png">http://dmon.org/graphics/zenoss/gen2.png</a></p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:26:25] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; But when I tired a few days ago none of the states listed because the state groups didn't have an address</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:27:20] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; But not sure what address we should use so I will have to check with my manager on that one.&#160; But good info to know.</p><p><span>[31-Dec-2009 15:27:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; here's France: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zenoss/2870405569/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/zenoss/2870405569/</a></p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:28:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; turns out that was a broken screenshot, he'd found a map bug and was only able to render 300 of his 500 locations</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:28:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we fixed the bug, never got a newer screenshot</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:29:57] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Yea.&#160; But in order to generate something like that you would have to have a flat location list :)</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:29:57] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; just noticed it was new years even</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:30:01] &lt;theacolyte-&gt; that's just not healthy</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:30:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; RobertLaptop: yup</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:30:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; but you could do multiple map portlets if you want</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:30:41] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; of course, 30+ portlets is unmanageable as well</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:30:42] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I am sure there is already a request to flat out the tree in maps</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:31:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; there is, I don't think it's gotten much consideration</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:31:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; bigger bugs to fix</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:31:40] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I figure there was ;)</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:34:37] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Outside of the fun of tracking windows that seems to be a lot of fun but then when is anything dealing with windows not a pain.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:35:02] * mrayzenoss doesn't do windows</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:35:14] * ke4qqq hates windows</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:35:21] * mrayzenoss as he reads Hyper-V documentation</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:35:29] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; lol</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:35:36] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; hyper-v zenpack coming?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:35:49] * ke4qqq should consider writing a libvirt zenpack</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:35:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm writing requirements for it</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:41:02] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; what is the diff between the enterprise VMWare pack and the community one?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:41:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Enterprise one does Virtual Center and uses VMware's native APIs</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:41:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so it can watch clusters of ESX servers and their shared resources</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:42:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; lots of events and whatnot already to go</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:42:26] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; The community one works with ESX with SNMP and lists the guests</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:42:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I've heard the free version of ESX doesn't provide SNMP</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:43:51] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; it doesn't, but it does do WBEM - and there is a community zenpack that does wbem - (you need the pywbem module, which incidentally let me to get that packaged for EPEL, so RHEL and CentOS users have it)</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:44:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; cool</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:44:19] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Free version of ESXi</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:44:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so there could be a WBEM-based VMware ZenPack in the future?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:44:33] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Big defference betten esx and esxi</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:44:57] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; indeed</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:45:07] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; esxi also does not have native console.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:45:39] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; mrayzenoss: someone already published the howto - just didn't package it</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:45:42] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Well it is an open secert on how to enable ssh.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:45:59] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; RobertLaptop: yeah but SNMP is an entirely different matter - quite a pain</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:46:07] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; hmmm</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:46:14] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Not an option under esxi.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:46:45] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; ESXi needs either wbem (still looking into that or SSH to monitor.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:47:21] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; ssh won't do you much good, you can't get the hw monitoring stuff going in it.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:47:25] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; so no checking for fans</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:47:33] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; unless I am missing something</p><p><span>[31-Dec-2009 15:47:41] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://linuxtrek1.blogspot.com/2009/02/zenoss-monitor-free-esxi-version.html">http://linuxtrek1.blogspot.com/2009/02/zenoss-monitor-free-esxi-version.html</a></p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:47:45] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; ^^ is the howto</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:48:02] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; maybe I'll tackle that really quickly rather than doing libvirt over hte weekend</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:49:15] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I will check it out.&#160; I have been looking for info for that.&#160; That is stage 2 of the roll out so it wasn't top prioty</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 15:52:22] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; This stage is mostly about getting basic checks in place and port monitoring to replace opennms.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 16:28:54] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; lol that quote in antitrust is 3:55 into the movie. "Don't you know the worse you look the smarter they think you are." Ha!</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 16:41:31] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Then people must think I am a genus.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 16:42:02] &lt;Fuzzy_T&gt; hahahaha</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:01:49] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Question for anyone still around is there a way to add a tool into the list like snmpwalk?&#160; so I can test wmi settings against a box?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:01:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yes</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:02:13] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Any links on how to do that?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:02:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; looking in the Admin Guide</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:02:46] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I see how to add tools but not the setting for WMI or did I miss that somehow?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:02:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Chapter 10, "User Commands"</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:03:11] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I will reread the section maybe it was there but didn't stick</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:03:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; User commands allow users to execute arbitrary shell commands from within Zenoss. These commands can then be run manually against a single device or a group of devices.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:03:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that sounds like what you want</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:05:37] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Yea.&#160; That I know.&#160; What I was looking for was a template to scan WMI info.&#160; I seem to be having a lot of problem with that.&#160; I keep thinking I have the issue fix then come back 10 min later seeing error in the event log.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:05:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; oh&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; you want wmic?</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:06:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; not sure where the docs are for it, but it's a command-line WMI tool</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:06:56] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Pretty much.&#160; That is turning up results.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:07:25] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I would like a way to add that to the tools like like snmpwalk for testing.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:07:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, you can use the User Commands to reference it through the UI</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:07:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I haven't used it myself, since I don't do much with Windows</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:08:19] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I wish I didn't.&#160; Linux is so much easier to manage.</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:09:33] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; I was hoping for a zenpack that would add that into tools with all the bells and whistles.&#160; But I can add it in manually.</p><p><span>[31-Dec-2009 17:38:19] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; can anyone tell where this was moved?&#160; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/community/wiki/TroubleshootingCommonErrorsSeenWhenMonitoringWindowsDevices/">http://www.zenoss.com/community/wiki/TroubleshootingCommonErrorsSeenWhenMonitoringWindowsDevices/</a></p><p><span>[31-Dec-2009 17:38:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="../community/documentation/wiki/windows.html">community/documentation/wiki/windows</a></p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:38:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; oh nuts, I gotta go</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:39:04] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Happy New Year</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 17:47:47] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; You to</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 18:21:14] &lt;RobertLaptop&gt; Yea.&#160; 20 Mins no errors</p><p>[31-Dec-2009 19:14:37] Fuzzy_T_ is now known as Fuzzy_T</p><p>[01-Jan-2010 00:00:18] &lt;kgoedtel&gt; Happy New Year!</p><p>[01-Jan-2010 00:00:30] [disconnected at Fri Jan&#160; 1 00:00:30 2010]</p></div><!-- [DocumentBodyEnd:e68ec12c-dba0-48d4-880d-0db5a15b558a] -->
