then you'd type "zencollectortool" on each, and select the appropriate option</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 09:03:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; on the master Zenoss server you'd select "Setup master" or whatever, and on the collector you'd select "Setup collector"</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 09:03:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; then it walks you through the setup (mostly automated)</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 09:04:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've tested it and it works well</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 09:05:07] &lt;SEJeff_work&gt; rmatte, Thats vaguedly similar to the functionality build in enterprise with the exception it is fully automated from the zenoss server webui in enterprise</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 09:05:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 09:05:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's not quite fully automated, but pretty close</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 09:05:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it actually tells you what to do step by step and even gives you the lines to paste in to the collector configuration</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 09:05:50] &lt;rmatte&gt;

well I think I did something bad by loading the SVN Version of the WMIDataSource.&#160; After removing that one(version 2.0.98) and installing the one from the Community web site, I get errors anytime I try to use the WMI datasource.&#160; Perhaps I should go back and reinstall with a clean install, since I was in the process of setting up a replacement for a really realy old zenoss(2.1.x version) and hadn't gotten real far into setting it up yet anyw</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 16:33:28] &lt;theacolyte&gt; what error?</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 16:34:25] &lt;Brixius&gt; Like a bug report screen.&#160; I think I'm going to do a stack restart and see if that takes care of it.</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 16:35:47] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg</p><p>[04-Mar-2010 16:38:03] &lt;Brixius&gt;

why do I need to install MIBs within zenoss if that MIB is alread on the monitored nodes ?</p><p>[05-Mar-2010 08:56:06] &lt;ckrough&gt; dec3pti0n: zenoss needs to be able to read the mib to translate snmp traps to English</p><p>[05-Mar-2010 08:56:20] &lt;ckrough&gt; dec3pti0n: I believe that's the only thing it's used for.

venturaville: it uses it's built in one because it needs to use python 2.4</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:10:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; though they are switching to 2.6</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:11:04] &lt;Simon4&gt; that's going to be nice :)</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:11:09] &lt;venturaville&gt; +1</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:11:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; but then python 3.0 will become standard and they'll be behind again</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:11:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; ;)</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:11:22] &lt;venturaville&gt; heh</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:11:42] &lt;npmccallum&gt; python3 isn't becoming standard anywhere anytime soon</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:11:49] &lt;npmccallum&gt; python2 will be supported for a long time</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:11:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; fair enough</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:11:58] &lt;venturaville&gt; yeah python3 breaks A LOT</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:12:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was more kidding than anything ;)</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:12:04] &lt;venturaville&gt; including the standard hello world app</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:12:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; my friend was using python 3.0 on his Linux system and was wondering why he was having problems</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:12:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was like "you're using 3.0, are you nuts?"</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:13:35] &lt;npmccallum&gt; python3 will be in all the major next releases</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:13:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, this will be nice if the upgrade doesn't break a bunch of stuff on the first attempt...</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:13:48] &lt;npmccallum&gt; but my guess is that there will be a parallel installable python2 for a while</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:14:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; npmccallum: yeh, there would have to be</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:14:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; one of our developers here tried learning Python and told me he hated it</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:14:43] &lt;venturaville&gt; I don't think it is in the new ubuntu</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:14:48] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: is he a COBOL programmer?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:14:49] &lt;venturaville&gt; or at least it isn't listed in the pool dir</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:15:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: nah, he does lots of web and database stuff</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:15:17] &lt;venturaville&gt; and I would be shocked if redhat 6 will have it</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:15:41] &lt;npmccallum&gt; venturaville: rh6 will have it</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:15:56] &lt;npmccallum&gt; venturaville: they hired someone just to do that this last year</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:16:02] &lt;venturaville&gt; interesting</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:16:05] &lt;venturaville&gt; got a link for that?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:16:42] &lt;npmccallum&gt; probably not</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:16:47] &lt;npmccallum&gt; but F13 has python3 already</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:17:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; mhmmmm, ...and we have errors after upgrade, now to try to sort these out...</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:17:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; Error running su zenoss -c '"/usr/local/zenoss/zenoss/bin/zenmigrate" ' :</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:17:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; mhmmmm, that's not good</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:17:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, I think this is that error that I figured out the fix for not too long ago</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:17:19] * rmatte checks his notes</p><p><span>[17-Mar-2010 09:17:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; Yeh, this one: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/6212">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/6212</a></p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:19:29] &lt;venturaville&gt; looking at F13 it looks as though the stock python will still be something pre 3</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:19:38] &lt;venturaville&gt; though they do have a python3 rpm on there</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:19:52] &lt;venturaville&gt; perhaps an alternate python root for it (ala debian)</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:20:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; unhunh, it's complaining about CMFCore</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:20:55] &lt;npmccallum&gt; yes, python3 won't be default for a while</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:21:04] &lt;npmccallum&gt; F14 at the earliest</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:21:06] &lt;npmccallum&gt; and it would be painful</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:21:19] &lt;npmccallum&gt; if we can get to python2.6, I would be very happy</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:21:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; Nate, any idea about this...</p><p><span>[17-Mar-2010 09:21:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://fpaste.org/HfzR/">http://fpaste.org/HfzR/</a></p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:21:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've seen that error for ZenPacks before</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:21:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh wait, nevermind</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:21:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know what it is, totally forgot</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:22:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; need to fix the namespace of one of my Windows SNMP Performance ZenPacks</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:22:12] * rmatte slaps forehead</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:23:53] &lt;venturaville&gt; yep looking at the macros.python3 file it is installing it as /usr/bin/python3 by default</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:38:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, that really really sucks, no idea how I'm going to fix this namespace issue without removing all of the windows devices from Zenoss</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:38:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, I think I'll just change the name of the other ZenPack, screw it</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:43:39] &lt;forsberg&gt; rmatta the synthtransaction thing works super!!! thanks again</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:44:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; npmccallum: to rename a ZenPack, is it as simple as unzipping it, changing the directory structure, and changing any reference to the ZenPack name in the files, then rezipping it and renaming to .egg?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:45:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; forsberg: np</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:45:30] &lt;npmccallum&gt; rmatte: I *think* so</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:46:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, guess I'll just have to try and see</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:48:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, time to try the upgrade again without colliding namespaces</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:51:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; hopefully no more UTC error</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:52:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; that seems to have fixed it, woot</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 09:57:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; now to decide what I want to do with these 3 .zip ZenPacks</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 10:01:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; lovely</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 10:01:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenpack --remove APC\ UPS\ PowerNet</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 10:02:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; doesn't work</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 10:02:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I can't remove the pack via the UI</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 10:02:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; guess it's time to resort to zendmd magic</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 10:03:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; that worked</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:07:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: aren't you supposed to be on vacation?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:08:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; easing back after a 4 day weekend</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:08:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:08:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:36:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; weird</p><p><span>[17-Mar-2010 11:36:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; when I use "/etc/init.d/zenoss-stack start" to start Zenoss after the upgrade I get: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://fpaste.org/SQCQ/">http://fpaste.org/SQCQ/</a></p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:36:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; but if I start zenperfwmi or zenticket manually as the Zenoss user they start fine</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:37:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; is that the updated version of Egor's pack?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:38:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's version 1.5</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:38:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I'm wondering why my custom daemon is also complaining</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:38:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I mean, it starts perfectly fine if I start it as the zenoss user</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:38:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; the startup script is the only time it errors out</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:41:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not written like a standard zenoss daemon is though, so that may be part of the problem</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:41:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll try upgrading egor's pack for starters</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:42:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, the latest is 1.5 according to the ZenPack page</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:43:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; is there any newer version?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:45:15] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Have any of you seen graphs be an hour off after daylight savings despite the system clock being correct?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:45:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, everything starts perfectly fine when done by hand, there must be something funky with the startup script</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:46:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: does zenoss time in the top right corner of the UI show the correct time?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:46:40] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah it does</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:46:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; weird</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:47:14] &lt;theacolyte&gt; It's just weird because I had an outage and I was looking at my graphs</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:47:28] &lt;theacolyte&gt; And the spike was exactly one out off from where I would have thought it would be</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:47:31] &lt;theacolyte&gt; LIke *exactly*</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:47:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; mine are all fine</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 11:53:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, they made changes to ctlscript.sh, which is probably what is causing the errors, just need to figure out what the heck they changed</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:08:29] RoAk is now known as RoAkSoAx</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:11:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it's not caused by any changes made directly to ctlscript.sh</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:39:26] &lt;car1&gt; i've got 2 instances of mysql running on different ports on a bunch of servers, to monitor each instance i have to create a local copy of the mysqlmonitor template and update the port number and graphs, would it be possible to script this for all of my database servers?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:39:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; car1: anything is possible with scripting, but I don't know how you'd do it exactly off the top of my head</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:39:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; hunt around on the community site for scripts that do similar things</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:40:48] &lt;Simon4&gt; car1: if the port numbers are the same across servers (say 3306 and 3307), just make a copy of template #1,&#160; as mysql_port2, change the graphs, and then apply that template wherever you like further down in your device tree</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:41:02] &lt;Simon4&gt; so the templates sit under /devices/server or whatnot</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:41:11] &lt;Simon4&gt; that way you only make the mod once, but can apply it to several servers</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:41:18] &lt;Simon4&gt; (we do this for the apache zenpack)</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:41:24] &lt;car1&gt; where are the device configurations (templates, and such) stored?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:41:31] &lt;car1&gt; i only see an 'events' database in the server</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:41:38] &lt;car1&gt; i don't know that much about the zenoss architecture</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:41:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; it is all stored in Zope</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:41:47] &lt;Simon4&gt; they're in zopedb, which needs some pythonfu to play with</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:41:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; MySQL is only used for events</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:41:49] &lt;car1&gt; Simon4: unfortunately the port is different for each instance</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:42:09] &lt;car1&gt; i'm totally unfamiliar with zope</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:42:12] &lt;car1&gt; damn</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:42:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a python based relational object database</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:42:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I didn't know about Zope or Python until I started using Zenoss</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:42:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to do some studying man</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:43:08] &lt;car1&gt; so i could possibly write a script to update the zope database directly?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:43:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; car1: are there a lot of devices?&#160; Would it make sense to have separate device classes depending on which port is being monitored?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:43:15] &lt;car1&gt; to apply local templates</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:43:28] &lt;car1&gt; there are 113 instances</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:43:32] &lt;car1&gt; different port for each</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:43:38] &lt;car1&gt; corresponding to a unique customer id</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:43:44] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ahhh</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:43:49] &lt;Simon4&gt; def needs scripting :)</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:43:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; sounds scriptable</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 12:43:58] &lt;Simon4&gt; and yeah, doable for sure</p><p><span>[17-Mar-2010 12:44:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

I installed the RC for your pack and the problem went away for that pack</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:38:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I still have the problem with my daemon that I wrote not importing libraries</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:38:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it only happens when I execute the startup script in /etc/init.d</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:38:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; any idea what I need to do to fix that?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:39:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've been digging through scripts for the last hour and a half trying to figure this out</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:40:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; my daemons works fine in 2.4.5, so I'm not sure what they changed, I figured you might know since you have a lot of experience with this stuff</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:40:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; daemon*</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:43:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; and just to clarify, if I do "zenticket start" as the zenoss user it starts up no problem</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:43:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it refuses to start when I use the /etc/init.d/zenoss-stack script to start it as root</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:46:50] &lt;bigegor&gt;

just wondering if you might know why that would be</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:48:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; (that readlink solution is great by the way, I adjusted my startup script to use that too)</p><p><span>[17-Mar-2010 13:48:53] &lt;rmatte&gt;

oh</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:56:10] &lt;npmccallum&gt; rmatte: nope :)</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:56:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; npmccallum: aha, there ye are</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:56:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; npmccallum: any idea why an import os fails when ctlscript.sh is executed?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:56:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; but works fine when the script is executed as the zenoss user</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:57:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; seems like a bug</p><p><span>[17-Mar-2010 13:57:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; charlieS_: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://fpaste.org/SQCQ/">http://fpaste.org/SQCQ/</a></p><p>[17-Mar-2010 13:57:42] &lt;rmatte&gt;

next week, I think.</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 14:37:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 14:37:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, once I figure out this import issue and you release those packs I'll be good to update</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 14:37:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; this has to be a path thing</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 14:38:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; bigegor: is that release version the one that supports full WMI modelling/monitoring?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 14:38:30] &lt;rmatte&gt;

i think</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:04:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; You'll be happy to know that I needed this for something too so I figured out how to do it</p><p><span>[17-Mar-2010 15:05:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="DOC-5822.html">docs/DOC-5822</a></p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:05:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll have to modify the code a bit to take in to account the half hour</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:05:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's simple to do</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:06:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:06:02] &lt;etank&gt; why would what i have not work?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:06:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, you're doing it based on timestamps of the events</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:06:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; so that's different</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:06:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; the reason it won't work the way you're doing it is because 05:30:00 is not an integer</p><p><span>[17-Mar-2010 15:06:38] &lt;etank&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dpaste.com/173082/">http://dpaste.com/173082/</a><span>&#160; &lt;-- that seems to work</span></p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:06:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; Python can understand the concept of something like if whatever &gt;= 100</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:06:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it has no idea what 05:30:00 is</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:07:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just a string to it</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:07:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; really?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:07:28] &lt;etank&gt; yup</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:07:31] &lt;etank&gt; give it a try</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:07:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:07:45] &lt;etank&gt; change the times around some too</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:08:19] &lt;etank&gt; my thought is that if i do this</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:08:21] &lt;etank&gt; datestamp, timestamp = str(evt.firstTime.split(' '))</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:08:36] &lt;etank&gt; then it would force timestamp to be a string and will allow it to work</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:08:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; wow, never thought that would work</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:08:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; apparently python is even cooler than I knew</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:08:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:09:03] &lt;etank&gt; :)</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:09:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; good work</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:09:22] &lt;etank&gt; i think that part of my problem was evt.action as opposed to evt._action</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:09:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; were you just going to use that in a transform though?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:09:51] &lt;etank&gt; i had evt._action='history' and it didnt seem to be working</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:09:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; you basically want certain events to be dropped at certain times?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:09:53] &lt;etank&gt; yeah</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:10:00] &lt;etank&gt; i have an event class</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:10:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; My method is a bit simpler honestly</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:10:18] &lt;etank&gt; and when those events come in between certain times i want to throw them in history</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:10:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; but whatever works</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:10:27] &lt;etank&gt; ok</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:10:32] &lt;etank&gt; let me ask this then</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:11:00] &lt;etank&gt; if i want a transform that will bump the sev when a count reaches a certain number how would i do that?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:11:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; if evt.count == 3:</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:11:27] &lt;etank&gt; ok</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:11:37] &lt;etank&gt; then set the sev</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:11:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; then under that if you'd do...</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:11:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; if evt.severity != 5:</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:12:06] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; evt.severity = evt.severity + 1</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:12:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; or just set it to something specific</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:12:39] &lt;etank&gt; on that event class i have all events come in as warning. when the count is above 10 within one hour i want to bump the sev to error. if it is outside the hour then throw it in history</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:12:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:12:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, do something like I just showed</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:13:07] &lt;etank&gt; the hour thing i think i can do easily</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:13:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll work fine</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:13:28] &lt;etank&gt; i set it to purge events after one hour that have a sev of warn or lower</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:13:41] &lt;etank&gt; may not be the best way to do it but i think it would work</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:13:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the hour thing you could use your technique against evt.firstTime and evt.lastTime</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:14:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; if less than an hour has elapsed between the 2 and the count is 10 do whatever</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:14:11] &lt;etank&gt; would i need to use timedelta?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:14:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd have to do it the way you showed me</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:14:45] &lt;etank&gt; ok cool</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:14:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; but also compare the dates to make sure that one isn't higher than the other</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:14:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; because that would mean that a whole day has elapsed</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:15:10] &lt;etank&gt; if datetime == datetime:</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:15:16] &lt;etank&gt; blah</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:15:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol, not quite</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:15:38] &lt;etank&gt; datestamp, timestamp = str(evt.firstTime.split(' '))</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:15:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; if date == date: more like it</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:15:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; after splitting them</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:15:47] &lt;etank&gt; if datestamp == datestamp</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:15:52] &lt;etank&gt; thats what i meant</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:16:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, you'll need 2 variables</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:16:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; 1 for the firstTime and 1 for the lastTime</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:16:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; then compare those 2</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:16:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then compare the 2 times</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:16:19] &lt;etank&gt; your right</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:16:27] &lt;etank&gt; easy enough i think</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:16:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, shouldn't be too bad, you've figured out the tricky part</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:16:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; Feel free to add your method to my wiki entry</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:16:57] &lt;etank&gt; :)</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:17:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's another good way of doing it</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:18:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure you do evt._action = 'history'</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:18:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; not evt.action</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:18:33] &lt;etank&gt; evt._action didnt seem to be working for some reason</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:18:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; evt._action is the only way that should work</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:18:46] &lt;etank&gt; not sure why</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:19:02] &lt;etank&gt; thats what made me think that my time stuff was broken</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:19:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it wasn't working then it was probably the code leading up to it which was wrong</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:19:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:19:27] &lt;jb&gt; anyone here understand MS licensing by any chance?:)</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:19:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; does evt.action even work for you?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:19:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; jb: expensive, unreasonable, decent service</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:20:00] &lt;etank&gt; rmatte: i would have to check tomorrow morning when it happens again to be sure i think</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:20:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; etank: k, evt._action = is really the proper way to do it</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:28:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, this is definitely a python library path issue of some sort</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:28:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can run any of the python environments as root and import os</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:51:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; think I half figured this out</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:51:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; when the startup script is running it's looking for os.py in trying /usr/local/zenoss/zenoss/lib/python/os.py</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:52:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; when I run it as the Zenoss user it's looking for it in /usr/local/zenoss/python/lib/python2.4/os.py</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:54:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I still haven't found any differences in the environment variables</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:54:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I'm stumped</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:55:02] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; rmatte: can you change pythons path in that script to look elsewhere first (really just changing the order of path)</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:55:32] &lt;ke4qqq&gt; I've had to do that when dealing with bundled python (speaking of bundled python is evil - just saying :) )</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:57:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; ke4qqq: I'm going to try that...</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:57:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was just kind of hoping to make this as dynamic as possible</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 15:57:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, I still can</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:04:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, that fixed the os issue, now it's complaining about the module time</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:04:02] * rmatte rolls his eyes</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:04:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; mhmmm, because apparently there isn't one, wtf</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:05:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, think I found it possibly</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:11:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, this is ridiculous, now the only time module I can find is in $ZENHOME/../python/lib/python2.4/lib-dynload</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:12:05] &lt;rmatte&gt;

finally got it</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:14:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; Had to add the following to the startup script for my daemon...</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:14:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; PYTHONPATH=$ZENHOME/../python/lib/python2.4:/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload:$PYTHONPATH</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:14:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; export PYTHONPATH</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:15:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; dirty solution since I have to use the system time module, but at least it's working</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:16:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; mhmmm, actually now it doesn't work properly as the zenoss user</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:16:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; this is fantastic</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:28:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; there, now it's fixed</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:28:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; Had to add:</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:28:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; PATH=$ZENHOME/../common/sbin:$ZENHOME/../python/bin:$ZENHOME/../mysql/bin:$ZENHOME/bin:$ZENHOME/../common/bin:$PATH</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:28:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; export PATH</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:30:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so it was your PATH, not your PYTHONPATH?</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:30:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; it was both</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:30:41] &lt;rmatte&gt;

export PATH</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:30:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is stupid, because it worked perfectly fine in 2.4.5</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:31:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure what changed, but the environment variables aren't being set properly</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:31:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; when the startup script kicks off it's using the system python</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:31:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is not good</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:32:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure if it actually runs the other daemons with the system python or not</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:32:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it would be worth investigating</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:33:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; at least this is a workaround of sorts for now</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:33:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; guess I'll be releasing an update to my zenticket daemon sooner than originally planned</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:34:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; egor basically just masked the problem by changing the way he was finding the path</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:34:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; and since he doesn't use the os or time modules apparently, he never gets errors when loading the daemon</p><p>[17-Mar-2010 16:34:58] &lt;rmatte&gt;

If you're talking about agents, Zenoss is agentless monitoring, so the answer to that would be no</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 12:51:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; It is capable of working with remote collectors (remote servers collecting data and feeding it back to a central server)</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 12:55:12] &lt;QbY&gt;

is it happening on every switch?</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 13:51:40] &lt;rhettardo&gt; no, just these two hp 1800-24's</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 13:52:30] * Simon4 coped ethernetCsmacd_64 to ethernetCsmacd under /Devices/Network and left it at that, meant all switches/routers defaulted to 64 bit counters</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 13:52:36] &lt;Simon4&gt; that might not be the "correct" way however</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:04:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: well, if it works then fine</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:09:48] mrayzenoss1 is now known as mrayzenoss</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:09:57] &lt;Simon4&gt;

since it sees it as a valid device</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:56:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you removed it, you'd still see the heartbeat errors but it wouldn't email</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:56:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; basically you have 2 options...</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:56:53] &lt;bmac2&gt; I want ot monitor the disk space on the debain box</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:56:59] &lt;bmac2&gt; and a couple of other things</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:57:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could add a filter to your alerting rule so that it doesn't alert for that one specific error</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:57:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could remove the device</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:57:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; or you can use the command I pasted above to eliminate the heartbeat errors</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:57:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; your call</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:57:29] &lt;bmac2&gt; which would be a more clean solution"</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:57:42] &lt;rmatte&gt;

though it's weird that you're event getting those heartbeat errors</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:57:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; how often do they occur?</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:57:58] &lt;bmac2&gt; and I am monitoring a ton of stuff</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:58:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; how much stuff?</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:58:08] &lt;bmac2&gt; I have got 37 of them</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:58:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, 37 isn't excessive</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:58:19] &lt;bmac2&gt; between 13:21 and 13:57</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:58:35] &lt;bmac2&gt;

bmac2: just use the command I pasted, if you ever need the heartbeat errors back you can just reinstall the Zenpack</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:59:26] &lt;bmac2&gt; k</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:59:30] &lt;bmac2&gt; so delete it from the database</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:59:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; Brixius: so install it again, then remove it again and see if the tab goes away</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:59:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; Brixius: that ZenPack is really only intended for developers though</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 14:59:55] &lt;bmac2&gt; I have 12 items I am monitoring</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 15:00:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; Brixius: not sure why you installed it in the first place unless you were intending to code a complex ZenPack</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 15:00:27] &lt;bmac2&gt;

basically it's an awesome front end to rrdtool</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:03:43] &lt;Simon4&gt; if you want to take it at it's most basic</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:04:02] &lt;Simon4&gt; but the layers on top are the bits that make the people who pay us happy :)</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:04:27] &lt;QbY&gt; hehe..&#160; now one question..&#160; and i haven't got to play with a demo, so&#160; may be asking a dumb question...&#160; zenoss generates rrd tools--can i link that graphic into another website?</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:05:10] &lt;Simon4&gt; basically, you can expose the rrd files anywhere you like</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:05:18] &lt;QbY&gt; nice</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:05:37] &lt;Simon4&gt; all the perf data storage is just in rrd files</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:05:42] &lt;QbY&gt; cause currently i have rrd generated by our current nms, then one that our customers see generated by another script</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:05:49] &lt;Simon4&gt; so yeah, any fronend you can think of is possible</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:06:28] &lt;QbY&gt; so, what's the bad..</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:06:32] &lt;QbY&gt; there has to be somethin gbad</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:06:35] &lt;QbY&gt; other than mysql</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:07:25] &lt;Simon4&gt; heh</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:07:36] &lt;Simon4&gt;

but, will make exceptions</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:08:48] &lt;Simon4&gt; we've found the time to create things like templates and reports can be a lot when you get a whole lot of oids - but that's looking at multiple "tenants' with multiple "applications" with multiple "kpis"</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:08:53] &lt;Simon4&gt; so we're a special case</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:09:10] &lt;Simon4&gt; asnd even then we've found scripting ways to create all that dynamically which is awesome</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:09:19] &lt;QbY&gt; let me get this installed</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:11:04] &lt;Simon4&gt;

not at all, other than maybe disk IO if your install grows</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:15:39] &lt;Simon4&gt; biut with 100 devices you should be fine</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:15:51] &lt;Simon4&gt; disk IO seemed to be the biggest hit for us</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:16:00] &lt;QbY&gt; remember my remote collectors</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:16:20] &lt;Simon4&gt; yup</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:16:52] &lt;QbY&gt; I can put a 1x Quad-Core 2.5Ghz 4GB RAM 320GB server... how's that?</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:17:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; sounds reasonable to me</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:17:31] &lt;Simon4&gt; basically, the things that made zenoss struggle for me were</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:17:58] &lt;Simon4&gt; a) untuned mysql events db - makes it really really slow to navigate around the UI and heartbeats fail occasionally</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:18:13] &lt;QbY&gt; OS--64bit or 32bit?</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:18:21] &lt;Simon4&gt; and b) slow disk means you can't update a bunch of rrd files in a hurry</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:18:31] &lt;Simon4&gt; 64bit, no reason not to these days</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:19:17] &lt;Simon4&gt; even with remote collectors we rsync the rrd data from&#160; collectors to the master server, so that multi-graph reports across multiple datacentres work just fine</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:19:34] &lt;Simon4&gt; not something you'll get as standard buit easy to make work</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:27:00] &lt;QbY&gt; what kinda disk space do you have allocated?</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 18:41:19] * Simon4 looks</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 19:04:56] &lt;Simon4&gt;

Source, RPM, or Virtual Appliance?</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 19:19:54] &lt;Simon4&gt; I can't see any issue with RPM</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 19:20:05] &lt;Simon4&gt; that way you can tune your mysql DB etc</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 19:20:15] &lt;Simon4&gt; can't see any gain with source tbh</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 19:20:36] &lt;Simon4&gt; if you don't have any mysql dba's, I guess go the appliance/stack</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 19:21:33] &lt;QbY&gt; hrmm</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 19:21:46] &lt;QbY&gt;

so if you're going to go with a default mysql install, the appliance may be better</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 19:25:00] &lt;Simon4&gt; maybe try the appliance and steal the my.cnf settings then go the rpm?</p><p>[18-Mar-2010 19:25:14] &lt;Simon4&gt;

we monitor stuff in europe that is realllllly slow to respond, you can literally read the snmpwalk line by line as it comes in</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:19:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I tweaked that and I was able to model them</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:20:01] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, we have it at 1800 for some kit</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:20:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just used 5000 for the heck of it, it can probably be set lower, but whatever</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:20:34] &lt;QbY&gt;

45 minutes and still walking</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:50:11] &lt;QbY&gt; geez</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:57:45] &lt;QbY&gt; i've got to find a better way to add equipment--if i have to wait 45+ minutes for each cmts i add, i won't be able to start monitoring for a freaking week</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:58:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, is that actually how long it takes to snmpwalk one?</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:58:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think Zenoss does a full walk even if you disable whatever plugins</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:58:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you sort of don't have a choice</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:58:54] &lt;QbY&gt; this is at 52 minutes and still walking</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:59:01] &lt;Simon4&gt; QbY: are there other ways to get the information?</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:59:11] &lt;QbY&gt; its a cisco router</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:59:25] &lt;Simon4&gt; you could possibly write a custom modeller plugin to fetch just hte bits you want and avoid the snmpwalk, not sure</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:59:44] &lt;Simon4&gt; so you enumerate the interfaces another way</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:59:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: it sounds simpler when you say it like that, but modeler plugins are not simple to write :P</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 12:59:55] &lt;Simon4&gt;

that's like saying "Oh, you're getting stuck in traffic on the way to work?&#160; All you have to do is take a rocket ship!"</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:00:42] &lt;Simon4&gt; actually, as it happens, I have modeller code open on my terminal, so I'll refine my suggestion in an hour or two</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:00:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; :P</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:00:48] &lt;Simon4&gt; since I'm about to do basically that</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:00:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:00:56] &lt;QbY&gt; venturaville: a CMTS.&#160; A CMTS is essntially a Cisco 7204VXR..&#160; But has cable interfaces--each one has thousands of modems hanging off of it..</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:01:04] &lt;venturaville&gt; ouch</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:01:12] &lt;QbY&gt;

i can't tell it in the snmpwalk command to just walk for interfaces</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:03:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss isn't actually using snmpwalk, if that's what you mean</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:04:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; it used twisted's snmp implementation</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:04:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; uses*</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:04:12] &lt;QbY&gt; i really want to use this software--based on what i've seen to date.. but this going to be too painful</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:04:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; QbY: you'll probably run in to the same issue no matter what software you use, honestly</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:04:53] &lt;QbY&gt; true</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:05:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you tried removing collector plugins and that didn't work any faster?</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:05:11] &lt;QbY&gt; we used to use jffnms.. and when i'd add a cmts it would hang for about a minute, but that was it</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:05:24] &lt;QbY&gt; i removed everyting except interfacemap</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:05:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think this is how Zenoss does it...</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:06:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; it performs a full walk, then stores that in memory, then the collector plugins are simply used to parse the data</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:06:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's kind of a crappy way of doing it, but that's the deal</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:06:16] &lt;QbY&gt; hrmm</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:06:27] &lt;QbY&gt; i wonder if i could make snmp view for just interfac ecs</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:08:13] &lt;QbY&gt; let me create a IF-Mib view only</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:08:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; QbY: do you have zRouteMapCollectOnlyLocal set to true?</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:08:45] &lt;QbY&gt; if that is the default yes</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:08:51] &lt;QbY&gt;

mrayzenoss: that setting does absolutely nothing for modelling time in my experience</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:10:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; it just means that only local routes are shown</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:10:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it still walks the entire route table</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:10:26] &lt;QbY&gt; i can set the cmts to only respond to certain mibs</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:10:33] &lt;QbY&gt; so a walk will only return certain mibs</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:10:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm pretty sure zenoss collects absolutely everything, stores it in memory, then parses it with the collector plugins</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:10:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; so there's no way to only have it collect partial info when modelling</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:10:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; in my own personal experience anyways</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:11:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; and if that is the case, it's a stupid way of modelling devices</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:11:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; QbY: well then get rid of the Mibs that have to do with routes</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:11:53] &lt;QbY&gt; its not the routes though</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:12:06] &lt;QbY&gt; if its walking the entire thing, that's a LOT of data</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:12:08] &lt;Simon4&gt; it's just the sheer number of interfaces, it sounds like</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:12:08] &lt;QbY&gt; a ton</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:12:16] &lt;QbY&gt; there are 45 actual interfaces</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:12:27] &lt;QbY&gt; but for each modem there is at least 10 different values</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:12:31] &lt;QbY&gt;

mrayzenoss: it's been removed.. the only thing i'm looking at is the interfacemap</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:15:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; looking for a good link explaining why</p><p>[19-Mar-2010 13:18:14] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I've got a few scripts, one logs in to a site then clicks the logout button, just to make sure that the backend of the site is working (since the login screen rarely fails but the backend fails often enough)</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:18:46] &lt;chewbranca&gt; ahhh nice</p><p><span>[22-Mar-2010 15:19:49] &lt;chewbranca&gt; that could definitely be useful, I've got a lot of random things that aren't part of the web facing side of the app that need to be monitored, so I really like the ability to send events through xmlrpc, found an interesting article here: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dancingpenguinsoflight.com/2009/05/send-events-to-zenoss-from-scripts/">http://dancingpenguinsoflight.com/2009/05/send-events-to-zenoss-from-scripts/</a></p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:20:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:20:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can do tons of stuff with the Zenoss API</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:20:56] &lt;davidX-&gt; mrayzenoss: do you know of any extensive docs for the virtual host xen monitor zenpack?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:21:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; davidX-: you talking about the libvirt pack?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:21:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; or some other xen pack?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:22:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, I see which one</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:22:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; you should try out the libvirt pack, it does xen monitoring and does it well apparently</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:22:22] &lt;davidX-&gt; ahh</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:22:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh actually, it's untested with Xen</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:22:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you might want to just use the pack you were looking at</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:23:13] &lt;davidX-&gt; i don't mind testing it</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:23:18] &lt;davidX-&gt; i'm testing the xen pack against a dev env</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:23:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; davidX-: but to answer your question, read the Zenpack page</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:23:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; it says "This ZenPack is documented in the Zenoss Extended Monitoring Guide."</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:23:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; with a link to the extended monitoring guide</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:24:14] &lt;davidX-&gt; yeah, the documentation there is, "here's how you add it."</p><p><span>[22-Mar-2010 15:25:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="DOC-5541.html">docs/DOC-5541</a></p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:25:14] &lt;rmatte&gt;

not sure how it's working for Xen as it appears to have not been tested yet</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:35:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's nice because it actually uses the API of each virtualization platform</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:36:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; Once he fixes the ESX stuff it'll be awesome for VMWare monitoring</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:42:21] &lt;davidX-&gt; we have a ton of virt platforms</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:42:30] &lt;davidX-&gt; hyperv, esx, esxi, xen, etc</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:42:43] &lt;davidX-&gt; so, this is definitely exciting</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:42:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool, you could really help out in testing that zenpack then</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:42:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; and once it's all polished up it'll be really useful for you</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:43:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm helping venturaville with ESX testing</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:43:12] &lt;davidX-&gt; i'll test against xen today</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:43:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; sweet</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:44:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; by the way, you'll need to install libvirt 0.7.0 or higher (0.7.7 worked best for me and it's the latest)</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:44:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you need help installing it let me know, I spent tons of time figuring it out ;)</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:45:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; but 0.7 or higher wasn't available in my package manager</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:45:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I had to compile from source</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:49:33] &lt;davidX-&gt; grabbing the tarball now</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:49:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:50:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; the dependencies for compiling from source are...</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:50:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; libxml2-dev</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:50:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; libdevmapper-dev</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:50:23] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I'm sure you'll figure that part out</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:51:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure you do ./compile --with-esx so that you have esx support as well</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:51:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; all the other support is active by default</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:53:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; getting libvirt installed is 95% of the battle with that pack</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:54:42] &lt;davidX-&gt; got it, thx</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 15:54:52] &lt;rmatte&gt;

i'll live with them..</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:20:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; k hehe</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:20:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk for a sec</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:22:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; back</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:24:27] &lt;QbY&gt; rmatte: you spoke of transforms earlier.&#160; i have snmp values i'm reading that are integers for example 150..&#160; however its actually 15.0 dBmV..&#160; everyone is used to seeing 15.0..&#160; would a transform be the way to fix that?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:24:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, a transform is one way, but you really just want it to be visible as 15.0 on the graphs right?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:25:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; or in the event as well?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:25:19] &lt;QbY&gt; both</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:25:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok... you're going to need a transform and an RPN expression for the graph</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:26:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; what does the event look like when it comes in?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:26:49] &lt;QbY&gt; well for the most part its not an event until it falls below a certain level</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:26:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so it's a threshold event</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:27:03] &lt;QbY&gt; yes</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:27:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; what event class does it come in for?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:27:14] &lt;QbY&gt; below 200 integer or 20.0 dBmV I need to alarm</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:27:23] &lt;QbY&gt; DOCSIS/SignalQuality</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:28:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, well, you saw the example I pasted earlier of how I did my transform to make the memory human readable right?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:28:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd have to do something similar, but even simpler</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:28:44] &lt;QbY&gt; let me scroll back--i'm so excited about this mass de-registration</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:28:47] &lt;QbY&gt; that you made it work</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:28:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:29:02] &lt;QbY&gt; i kept hearing all weekend "see--open source isn't it"</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:29:06] &lt;chewbranca&gt; anyone know approximately how much resources is required to run zenoss monitoring on a server?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:29:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; open source is it, it just takes time to learn it</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:29:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've spent a year learning Zenoss, once you really learn it well it's extremely powerful</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:29:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just not super straightforward for first time users</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:30:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; our management is quite impressed with what I've been able to squeeze out of it</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:30:19] &lt;QbY&gt; rmatte: .. no, it isn't, but its kinda easy to figure out--i am going to update (if you don't) my post and show how it was fixed</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:30:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:30:30] &lt;QbY&gt; because i'm sure i'm not the only person</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:30:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup, good idea</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:30:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; always good to follow up so that people coming across it in the future don't just hit a dead end ;)</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:31:04] &lt;QbY&gt; if you can, i want to make sure that i can get this event set right</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:31:11] &lt;QbY&gt; becuase this is the most important alarm we have</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:31:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:32:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, show me what you have when you're done and I'll tell you whether it should work or not</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:32:11] &lt;QbY&gt; the threshold is going into event class "Service/Availbility"</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:32:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:32:35] &lt;QbY&gt; so would i start by adjusting it there--also, i don't kno wif this matters</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:32:41] &lt;QbY&gt; lets say there are 200 modems on an interface</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:33:05] &lt;QbY&gt; if there are only 170 active, that's an alarm.</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:33:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; by the way, sorry to interrupt, but how did you end up fixing your modelling issue?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:33:17] &lt;QbY&gt; mine?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:33:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, where it was taking like 5 years to model a device</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:33:39] &lt;QbY&gt; snmp-server view</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:33:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, so it was a change on the device side?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:33:54] &lt;QbY&gt; the cisco cmts has waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much info--most of which is not necessary for monitoring/modeling</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:33:56] &lt;QbY&gt; yes</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:33:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok cool</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:34:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so what is the name of the datasource that represents the amount of modems</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:34:27] &lt;QbY&gt; it was just choking on that..&#160; so i created a view for what was really needed--excluding the rest</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:34:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; and what is the name of the datasource that represents the amount of active?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:35:21] &lt;QbY&gt; TotalModems is the number of modems seen on that niterface in the past 24 hours</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:35:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:35:33] &lt;QbY&gt; RegisteredModems are the total number of online / active modems</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:35:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, so those are the 2 we're working with then...</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:35:51] &lt;QbY&gt; yes</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:36:01] &lt;QbY&gt; they are both graphed too if that makes a difference</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:36:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you want to be alerted if the amount of active drops below 70% of the total amount</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:36:12] &lt;QbY&gt; yes</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:36:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; k...</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:36:17] &lt;QbY&gt; 85% actually</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:36:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you'd do...</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:37:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, first you'd create a new threshold</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:37:36] &lt;QbY&gt; which i have one..</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:37:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; and make the threshold against registered modems</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:37:44] &lt;QbY&gt; which i do</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:37:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; so select that from the list of datasources</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:37:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; then in the Min value (not max)</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:37:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'd put: here.getRRDValue('TotalModems') * 0.85</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:38:02] &lt;QbY&gt; that's exactly what i have</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:38:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; that'll work</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:38:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; That's telling Zenoss that the minimum amount of modems has to be 85% of the total</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:38:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it drops below, it'll trigger the threshold</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:38:46] &lt;QbY&gt; and it did (i set it for 100% earlier just to check)</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:38:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; good stuff</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:39:29] &lt;QbY&gt; now.. before you go further..</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:39:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you want it to be 17.0 instead of 170?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:39:42] &lt;QbY&gt; at 100 modems, if only 84 are online, its going to cross the threshold and alarm</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:39:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's right</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:40:00] &lt;QbY&gt; however, some deregs start at 84.. but can go down and down and down</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:40:05] &lt;QbY&gt; so next poll it could only be 40 online</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:40:14] &lt;QbY&gt; would that be a new event, or a continuation of the first</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:40:34] &lt;QbY&gt; the 17.0 vs 170 is for signal measurements</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:40:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; as long as it's for the same set of datapoints it would be a continuation of the first event, it would increase the event count on the event and update the current value in the summary</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:41:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; so for instance, first poll if it was 84, then you'd see "threshold of whatever not met: current value: 84"</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:41:37] &lt;QbY&gt; gotcha..&#160; is it possible to in the email let them know the total missing--currently (our perl script) says, "there should be X but there are only Y"</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:41:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; then on the next poll, event count would go to 2 and the event summary would be automatically updated to "threshold of whatever not met: current value: 40"</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:42:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:42:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you could use a transform to figure that out</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:42:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; and update the summary with the amount missing</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:43:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; missing = here.getRRDValue('TotalModems') - here.getRRDValue('RegisteredModems')</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:44:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; evt.summary = 'Total missing: %s' % (missing)</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:44:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; as an example</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:44:29] &lt;QbY&gt;&#160; when you say "transform" where is that at?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:44:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I recommend that you read the section of the Zenoss admin guide to get a basic understanding of it</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:45:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a huge mouthful to explain everything in here</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:45:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's a whole section covering transforms</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:45:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; there is also tons of wiki documentation</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:45:28] &lt;QbY&gt; ok..</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:45:51] &lt;QbY&gt; so, in my emails..&#160; which i need it to go every 5 minutes until someone silences it</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:45:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; a transform is just a python script</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:46:00] &lt;QbY&gt; do i do that in transforms also?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:46:08] * QbY knows no python</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:46:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's used to manipulate events automatically when they come in</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:46:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's fine, the small amount of python that you need to learn to do transforms is almost nothing</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:46:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; braindead simple</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:46:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; No, for the emails where you need it to go 5 minutes before someone silences it, you need to set the repeat time in your alerting rule</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:47:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; alert every 5 minutes, rather</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:48:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; and that example I gave before was a bit off, it would actually be...</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:48:09] &lt;QbY&gt; so settings-&gt; users..&#160; create a group</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:48:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; dev = dmd.Devices.findDevice(evt.ipAddress)</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:48:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; missing = dev.getRRDValue('TotalModems') - dev.getRRDValue('RegisteredModems')</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:48:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; evt.summary = 'Total missing: %s' % (missing)</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:48:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you can either create a group or do alerts per individual user</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:48:57] &lt;QbY&gt; rmatte: but these are checked on the Interfaces of a device</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:49:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, well, you can still do it, it'll just be finding an interface instead of the device itself</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:49:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; read up on transforms first so that you have a basic understanding</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:49:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; once you have that I'll help you out with the transform</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:50:55] &lt;QbY&gt; ok, last question--because you've given me enough to keep me busy all night</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:51:08] &lt;QbY&gt; i would like to use the graphs in an existing portal application we have</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:51:26] &lt;QbY&gt; is there a way i can put a url in the &lt;img&gt; tag?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:52:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, that's a bit tough, I mean, you can get the link to the image by right clicking and doing copy link location...</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:52:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; or copy image location rather</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:52:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you need to be authenticated with Zenoss to see the image</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:52:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; so using the images in a portal would be challenging</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:52:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; the other option is to access the RRD files directly using RRDtools</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:52:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that's development work</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:53:29] &lt;QbY&gt; ah</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:53:41] &lt;QbY&gt; maybe a script on the server that would generate the rrd and feed it out</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:53:51] &lt;QbY&gt; i just don't want to go giving access to everyone to the system</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:53:57] &lt;QbY&gt; unless its a very restricted access</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:54:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, if you give them regular user access, they won't be able to modify anything</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:54:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; they'll just be able to view stuff</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 16:54:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk, brb</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:01:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; back</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:02:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; my Zenoss instances are integrated with LDAP and I can control user access by adding them to specific LDAP groups that I've created</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:02:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; so our frontline NOC guys get added to the FrontLine group and only get regular user access</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:02:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; Engineers get added to the Engineers group and get full access</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:03:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; ...but I'm dealing with multiple Zenoss instances, doesn't make much sense if you only have 1 instance</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:04:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can also create custom roles which only have access to specific things, but you have to do it in Zope and it's a bit complex</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:04:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just stick with the basic roles</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:09:28] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; hi to all</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:10:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; hey</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:10:11] &lt;Simon4_&gt; hi hi</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:11:04] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt;

does it work?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:13:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; or have you not tested it?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:13:46] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; looks like it work...</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:13:51] &lt;rmatte&gt;

the thing about ZiPEC is that they haven't submitted it to the app store</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:20:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you need to jailbreak your phone to use it</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:20:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; which kind of sucks</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:20:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:21:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, it looks like it's just an ajax app</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:21:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I could be wrong</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:21:16] &lt;Simon4_&gt; webapp it seems</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:21:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:21:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'd be cooler if it was an actual iphone app in the app store</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:21:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; less load time</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:22:14] &lt;Simon4_&gt; slightly trickier to make work I guess, would need to support http/https, then access one of the API's I guess</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:22:29] &lt;Simon4_&gt; (we hide public zenoss behind https on apache)</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:22:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; unhunh, well, so far Zenoss 2.5.2 is reporting that interfaces are down on interfaces that are clearly up</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:23:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; guess I'll have to tackle that one tomorrow</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:23:24] &lt;chewbranca&gt; problem with a webapp is that its request driven rather than event driven, I'm basically looking for a more advanced notifier than just getting an email</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:23:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; don't want to upgrade and end up with an interface monitoring nightmare</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:23:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; anyways, I'm out of hear, ttyl guys</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:23:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; out of here* rather</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:23:58] &lt;chewbranca&gt; although its looking like just writing an android app to parse your emails and respond based on filters is probably the simplest and most flexible solution</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:23:59] * sergeymasushko is sad due to there is no official apple store in his country :(</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:24:00] &lt;rmatte&gt;

mrayzenoss: that would be cool, with some push support would be even cooler</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:25:01] &lt;chewbranca&gt; mrayzenoss, nice, no iphone for me though</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:25:17] &lt;Simon4_&gt; since as chewbranca says, it's all about getting relevant stuff in a timely manner, which doesn't work on an iphone singletasking</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:25:22] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Simon4_: yeah, I told them to make sure they take advantage of all the hooks provided</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:25:45] &lt;QbY&gt; rmatte: in my mass de-registration (totalmodems * .85) how would i write the clear event?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:26:14] &lt;chewbranca&gt; Simon4_, yeap, which is why I think basically just an email filter system with notifications and sounds attached is probably the best bet, then you're also not limited to one particular platform, I get lots of different notifications and would like to tie them all together</p><p><span>[22-Mar-2010 17:46:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

yep</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:51:37] &lt;lronPaw&gt; and it works for other hosts (at least 2) through zenoss</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:52:01] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; have you increased debug level logging for the zencommand ?</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:52:13] &lt;lronPaw&gt; i did a -d 10</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:52:15] &lt;lronPaw&gt; i think</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:52:35] &lt;lronPaw&gt; but like i said i couldn't find how to run the zenpack via zencommand</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:53:00] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt;

or at least trace where its failin gin the logs</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:55:30] &lt;lronPaw&gt; its just instigating that command through zenoss thats the hard bit for me at this poiint</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 17:58:45] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; lronPaw: if the command is ran through zenoss and there is an error so you should be able to find this info in the log... if the log is empty than you are looking in the wrong place of the command was not run.</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 18:04:45] &lt;lronPaw&gt; yeh well i am thinking the commands not being run for that device</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 18:04:56] &lt;lronPaw&gt; we have a considerable number of devices and only 1 collector at this stage</p><p>[22-Mar-2010 18:05:12] &lt;lronPaw&gt;

well first off, there's no O/A anymore, they've been replaced with "Status", which is fine...</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 08:59:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; the problem is that it automatically sets any interface that's administratively up to monitored when modelling, regardless of the operational status</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 09:00:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is a backwards way of doing it</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 09:00:17] &lt;ckrough&gt; what do you mean "monitored"? as in, it creates an even if it flaps or goes down?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 09:00:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 09:00:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; and since it's already technically down, you get events</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 09:00:39] &lt;ckrough&gt; I remember us discussing this in IRC with the devs</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 09:00:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've doing active interface status polling though, most people rely on traps</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 09:00:47] &lt;ckrough&gt; I think chet had a workaround for larger installs</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 09:00:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I had a long discussion of this with cluther</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 09:01:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, not sure if the changes that Chet and I discussed even got implemented, doesn't appear that they did</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 09:01:35] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I have to do most of my coding outside of work for it, since I can't justify a lot of hours on it otherwise</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:02:03] &lt;venturaville&gt; so a bit slower than I would like</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:02:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:02:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do pretty much all of my coding while at work</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:02:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I'm going to setup some development servers at home and start doing some work at home as well</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:03:43] &lt;venturaville&gt; I keep a zenoss-stack and a bunch of KVM guests on my laptop, then I can just fire it all up and do coding on the hour long bus ride to and from work</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:04:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:04:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've got a rackmount server sitting on my desk at home with 4 1.6GHz processors in it</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:04:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm getting a dedicated server to move all of the stuff off of that to soon, then I'm going to throw ESXi on it and setup some development VMs</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:07:28] &lt;venturaville&gt; argh ... so on a loaded down zenoss server, even with 3 workers.. if I make a couple of graph point edits, and then hit the perf tab on the only system bound to that template... it sits there for many minutes</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:08:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never seen that behaviour before</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:08:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; you sure you're not just getting caught up in the middle of a busy polling cycle?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:09:13] &lt;venturaville&gt; it doesn't matter when I do it</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:09:18] &lt;venturaville&gt; I can replicate it quite reliably</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:09:47] &lt;venturaville&gt; it acts as though everything in zenhub is being blocked while the updates are run</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:10:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; weird</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:11:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; do you have the HP ProCurve or Cisco MIBs ZenPack installed on that system?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:12:00] &lt;venturaville&gt; the cisvo mibs yes</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:12:06] &lt;venturaville&gt; but then most everyone does</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:12:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you perform the step listed on the Zenpack page?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:12:44] &lt;venturaville&gt; which step?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:12:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; the step that the ZenPack page says to perform in zendmd</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:13:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; dmd.ZenPackManager.packs._delObject('ZenPacks.Nova.Cisco.Mibs')</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:13:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; commit()</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:13:45] &lt;venturaville&gt; and what does that do?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:14:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; the pack has a ton of objects, and there's some bug in Zenoss which causes it to scan through zenpack objects when certain pages are loaded and certain actions are performed which makes the UI sluggish as all hell</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:14:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; performing that step removes the ZenPack from the list while leaving the MIBs installed</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:14:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; which eliminates the performance issues</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:15:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; It took me quite a while to figure out that fix</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:16:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; The performance issues were unbearable until I did</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:16:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; 15 minutes to load zProperties pages sometimes for example</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:16:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; performance issues with anything to do with editing templates as well</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:19:12] &lt;venturaville&gt; apparently we don't have that one installed on this particular zenoss server</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:19:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, then that's not the issue</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:19:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; what packs do you have installed on there?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:19:36] &lt;venturaville&gt; interestingly it is almost precisely a minute time lag added per data point updated</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:19:40] &lt;venturaville&gt; dozens</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:19:50] &lt;venturaville&gt; we are a very heterogenous environment........</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:19:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenpack --list &gt; fpaste.org</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:20:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; man, what the heck did they do to the Data Point Rate graph in 2.5.2?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:20:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; instead of nice steady data I get wedges</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:21:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; that bug I was talking about also affects installs with large numbers of ZenPacks installed</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:21:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; The fact that you have 72 installed is most likely a contributing factor</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:22:35] &lt;venturaville&gt; got a trac ticket # for that bug?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:22:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol, IRCd monitor, you guys really did install everything and anything almost ;)</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:22:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; let me dig it up (I filed it)</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:23:04] &lt;venturaville&gt; and we are using nearly all of them heavily</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:23:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p><span>[23-Mar-2010 12:23:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5071">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/5071</a></p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:23:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the bug ticket I opened 10 months ago for that issue</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:24:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; The first comment by bbibeault is "Not limited to this zenpack; the more zenpacks and the more packables, the worse this problem becomes."</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:28:10] &lt;venturaville&gt; we have the HP proliant MIBs loaded</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:28:16] &lt;venturaville&gt; going to see if dropping some of those helps</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:29:25] &lt;venturaville&gt; geesh ... 199 mibs and 10s of thousands of nodes in the HP Proliant MIB stack :-/</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:33:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; you don't need to drop them</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:33:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; just do the same as what's listed on the Cisco page for the pack</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:34:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; the same steps are actually listed on the HP Proliant MIB page</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:34:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not the fact that the objects are in Zope, it's the fact that the pack is indexed as a ZenPack</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:34:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; once Zenoss no longer sees it in the ZenPack list you're good</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:34:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; drop any other packs that you know you're not using, it'll help with performance</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:35:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; Hopefully they'll fix that bug at some point</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:36:26] &lt;venturaville&gt; it looks as though we have a lot of the HP MIBs, but they were installed singly instead of the big zenpack</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:36:29] &lt;venturaville&gt; still craziness</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:37:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:37:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; so they were installed via zenmib you mean?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:37:37] &lt;venturaville&gt; that is what I think yes</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:37:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:38:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, I'm pretty sure that the number of ZenPacks that you have installed is causing the response issue</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:49:28] &lt;mistich&gt; rmatte how do I set a Property on a threshold in zendmd</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 12:51:17] &lt;mistich&gt;

hello</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:13:56] &lt;cain23&gt; can you set alerting rules on the devices themselves?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:14:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, but you can set filters on the alerting rules to limit them to certain devices</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:18:36] &lt;cain23&gt; yeah i know that...</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:20:04] &lt;cain23&gt; but can you have the alerting rules limit by the eventGroup id?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:23:57] &lt;citrus2&gt; so a couple weeks ago i got zenoss ping monitoring all my servers in 3 different datacenters.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; so the internet connection goes out at 3am this morning here where the zenoss box is and it spams my email with every single server is down every 5 minutes for 50 servers,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; how do i make a rule to avoid this and just let me know my internet connection at the office went down</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:24:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can have them filtered by absolutely anything cain23</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:24:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; create an alert and check the filters</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:25:11] &lt;cain23&gt; i have, but not seen eventgroup id</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:25:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; citrus2: that's one of the tricky things with Zenoss, it only supports layer3 topology, and that's useless if it doesn't completely understand the topology (which is basically impossible in most cases)</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:25:32] &lt;cain23&gt; Looking to just filter by application event log errors....</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:25:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; cain23: "group"</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:25:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; you mean event group?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:26:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's event class</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:26:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's all there, just read more carefully</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:26:23] &lt;cain23&gt; on the event its listed as eventGroup</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:26:49] &lt;citrus2&gt; rmatte,&#160; what do you do in this case?&#160; or others?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:27:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; citrus2: nothing, we just put up with the flood of alerts in the event that that happens</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:27:12] &lt;cain23&gt;

eventClass would be better</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:28:54] &lt;cain23&gt; event class is /Unknown</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:29:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; eventGroup is not filterable, so you're going to have to pick something else</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:30:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; are there other commonalities between the events?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:30:24] &lt;cain23&gt; ha, I noticed...but people are requesting all application event log errors, or all system errors...</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:30:36] &lt;cain23&gt; for certain devices</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:31:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; What about Agent?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 13:31:09] &lt;citrus2&gt; rmatte,&#160;&#160; is their nothing conditional that i can set?&#160;&#160;&#160;

Zenoss checks the hosts file to see the hostname of the server and takes the first hostname</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 14:00:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it uses that for monitoring itself</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 14:00:14] &lt;straterra&gt; ah..the alert went away</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 14:00:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; you honestly probably didn't even have to remove it, just switch the order around</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 14:00:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; the name that you added in to Zenoss should be first in the hosts file</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 14:01:13] &lt;straterra&gt; Ah, ok</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 14:01:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if you added hosts2 in to zenoss and in hosts it was showing as 127.0.0.1 hosts1 hosts2 you'd change it to look like 127.0.0.1 hosts2 hosts1</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 14:01:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss uses the socket.getfqdn() function which grabs the first FQDN from the hosts file</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 14:02:28] &lt;straterra&gt; that makes sense then</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 14:02:49] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I see</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:25:10] &lt;Simon4_&gt; we decided we wanted four days of full res, to cover long weekends and the like</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:25:26] &lt;Simon4_&gt; so 1440 = 5 days</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:25:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; so only the first line needs to be changed, everything else can be left?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:25:32] &lt;Simon4_&gt; just ot be safe</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:26:08] &lt;Simon4_&gt; the first line is the "full res", the next line is the first lot of consolidation, the next line the next etc, so if they want 30 days at full res, they may want longer at the next resolution?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:26:53] &lt;Simon4_&gt; if not, then you don't need to modify any other lines</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:27:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I need 8640</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:27:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; but the other problem is, that I need 1 minute 30 second polling cycles</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:27:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I need to adjust the frames</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:27:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; or columns, whatever they are called</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:27:33] &lt;Simon4_&gt; yeah, the step length needs to change</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:27:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is where?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:28:04] &lt;Simon4_&gt; looks like it's set by zenoss elsewhere, or automatically based on the "snmp Performance Cycle Interval" on the same page</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:28:07] &lt;Simon4_&gt; that would be my guess</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:28:24] &lt;Simon4_&gt; if you create a dev, and change that, a rrdtool dump on a file will tell you if it's picked it up</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:28:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok cool</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:29:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; thanks</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:30:04] &lt;Simon4_&gt; will be interesting to see how rrdtool graph likes the larger files</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:30:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it will indeed</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:30:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hope it doesn't crash and burn</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:31:04] &lt;Simon4_&gt; mirror rrd files to ramdisk, serve rrdgraph out of ram :)</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:31:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; don't have ramdisk</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:31:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; and don't want to waste RAM setting one up</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:31:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:32:30] &lt;Simon4_&gt; I ahve a mad idea to have Data.fs in ram with a 5 min writeback to disk - seeded by someone else a while ago... keen to give it a go</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:32:47] &lt;Simon4_&gt; doing same for rrdfiles could be a laugh, that or at least make sure the linux filesystem cache keeps em around</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:33:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, but if the server fails you lose 5 minutes of data</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:33:49] &lt;Simon4_&gt; data.fs isn't a big deal, just config, and rrdfiles you possibly seed the other way using the filesystem cache</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:34:05] &lt;Simon4_&gt; thtat or rrdfiles on ssd would be equally good</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:34:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; true, but say you make a bunch of config changes, then the server dies, have fun going back and checking to make sure they are all still there</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:34:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's unlikely, but possible</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:34:37] &lt;Simon4_&gt; yeah, it's a risk for sure</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:34:58] &lt;Simon4_&gt; again, maybe SSD is the smarter option</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:35:09] &lt;Simon4_&gt; tis slowly getting more affordable</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:35:52] &lt;nonsenso&gt; doesn't reconnoiter do something similar with not averaging old data?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:38:18] &lt;Simon4_&gt; rmatte: I'm up to 250-300,000 datapoints on a set of spindles so disk perf is starting to get fun</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:40:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can imagine</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:40:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's a lot of datapoints</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:41:16] &lt;Simon4_&gt; tenant applications with tenant defined datapoints via a custom zenpack</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:41:19] &lt;Simon4_&gt; give them rope.....</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:41:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; and zey hang</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:41:45] &lt;Simon4_&gt; some applications come up with &gt;1000 kpi's they want measured... and take some convincing that maybe they really dont' care that much</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:41:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:45:32] &lt;Simon4_&gt; gah, vmware's NAT engine has timeouts :/</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:46:28] &lt;Brixius&gt; anyone have a good idea how to handle HP ILO interfaces in zenoss?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:47:38] &lt;Simon4_&gt; Brixius: it's next on my list once I sort this BladeChassis stuff</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:47:55] &lt;Simon4_&gt; what are you wanting to get out of the ILO?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:48:43] &lt;Brixius&gt; I'm not sure what the best way to handle them is as they send traps for the server they are in as well.&#160; It'd be nice to have a way to associate them with the server they belong to so that traps recieved are tied correctly in zenoss</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:49:19] &lt;Simon4_&gt; true</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:50:04] &lt;straterra&gt; rmatte: hmm?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:51:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; straterra: sorry, auto-complete</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:51:26] &lt;straterra&gt; ah, ok</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:51:41] &lt;Brixius&gt; hmm another problem, event rollup doesn't appear to be working in 2.5.2, I can goto individual devices and see events, but when I look at events under the orginizer there's nothing listed.</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:51:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; meant to paste: RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:600</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:51:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; like that</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:51:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; but my client auto-completed rra to straterra</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:52:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:52:10] &lt;straterra&gt; well, that works</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:52:19] &lt;straterra&gt; You should use straterra graphs</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:52:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 15:53:52] &lt;Simon4_&gt;

for those who don't run OA shared IP mode</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:22:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:22:56] &lt;Simon4_&gt; it doesn't die, it just returns nothing, and a nice message would be good</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:23:29] &lt;Simon4_&gt; will have to try snmp on a standby OA to see if it's similar or not</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:25:40] &lt;Simon4_&gt; I need to sort the bladeserverlist report too, since you can sort by a) position, or b) chassis, but not chassis then position</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:25:55] &lt;Simon4_&gt; which is kinda dumb, and I think a limitation of the table design</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:26:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; youp</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:26:19] &lt;Simon4_&gt; breaking it out by chassis seems sensible though</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:26:24] &lt;Simon4_&gt; so one table per blade chassis</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:27:39] &lt;Simon4_&gt; in better news, modelling of 10 chassis went perfectly, got all details into the db... will work on the other things this week :)</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:28:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; sweet</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:29:28] &lt;Simon4_&gt; did you ever use the "height/width/depth" values?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:29:50] * Simon4_ is guessing they were added because the snmp data gave them, vs for any requrements reason</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:32:12] &lt;QbY&gt; Questions about a reboot--first, after rebooting my installation didn't poll until I went and started several of the daemons..&#160; also, sveeral interfaces which I had disabled for monitoring were re-enabled..</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:33:39] &lt;Simon4_&gt; QbY: I've run into disabled monitoring things reenabling after a model, wihch happens automatically every 12 hours unless configured otherwise</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:33:51] &lt;QbY&gt; ah</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:33:59] &lt;QbY&gt; what's "Lock IPInterfaces"</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:34:01] &lt;Simon4_&gt; you might be able to lock such things after disabling them</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:34:02] &lt;Simon4_&gt; yeah, that</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:34:14] &lt;Simon4_&gt; I _believe_ it stops modeling messing with it again</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:34:21] &lt;Simon4_&gt; which is most likely what you're after</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:36:11] &lt;QbY&gt; ok</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:36:53] &lt;QbY&gt;

there was a discussion about that in here a week or so back</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:37:27] &lt;Simon4_&gt; rmatte: do you remember that? suppressing clear events?</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:38:34] &lt;Simon4_&gt; QbY: from memory someone wrote an event transform to basically kill the clear events, which achieved such things</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:38:51] &lt;QbY&gt; i want it to clear--but don't want it to delete</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:38:55] &lt;QbY&gt; we need historical information sometimes</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:40:18] &lt;Simon4_&gt; hmmm, cleared events and other stuff still end up in the history table</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:40:32] &lt;Simon4_&gt; can't find where in the new events console however that you access the event history</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:41:39] &lt;Simon4_&gt; ah</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:41:45] &lt;Simon4_&gt; bottom left, click on "event history"</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 16:41:55] &lt;Simon4_&gt;

QbY: events never get deleted (well, unless you have "Delete Historical Events Older Than" set in Event Manager), they just get moved to history</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:43:07] &lt;QbY&gt; ok i found it..</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:43:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; QbY: as far as only emailing an event once a day, you're going to have to get fairly crafty... you'll need to create an alerting rule without a repeat time for just that event...</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:43:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; then have an event transform that automatically moves the event to history at a certain time each day</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:44:11] &lt;QbY&gt; ok</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:44:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; after being moved to history, when it regenerates it'll alert</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:44:23] &lt;QbY&gt; gotcha</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:45:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; if the event auto-clears that method won't work</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:45:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; and if anyone moves it to history manually, it won't work</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:45:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's the only way to do it</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:47:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; honestly, if you just don't enable a repeat time on the alert, and tell people to manually clear the event once they've resolved it (there's a clear link right in the alert email) that's really the intended way to handle it</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:48:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; the auto-clearing of it daily is just another option if need be</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:54:58] &lt;QbY&gt; rmatte: you know what sucks is..&#160; it can clear on its own</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:55:20] &lt;QbY&gt; one poll it could be bad, next poll good, so...&#160; i'm going to get an endless stream of them if the conditions are right</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:56:39] &lt;Simon4_&gt; QbY: you can stop alerts from flapping by specifying "count &gt;2" or similar in alert rults</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:56:41] &lt;Simon4_&gt; rules</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:57:05] &lt;Simon4_&gt; so they still get stored/recorded, but emails don't go out unless there's more than one consecutive etc</p><p>[23-Mar-2010 17:57:18] &lt;QbY&gt; hrmm..&#160;

it can/could do more, but it isn't the best tool for that</p><p>[24-Mar-2010 14:35:32] &lt;venturaville&gt; you can have something that queries zenoss and spits out a puppet config .........</p><p>[24-Mar-2010 14:35:45] &lt;tlir&gt;

You just said you only need it to do the backup once a day, so how much are you really going to be modifying the schedule?</p><p>[24-Mar-2010 14:36:06] &lt;tlir&gt; I'm just wondering if I can get both of these functions with an app out of the box</p><p>[24-Mar-2010 14:36:30] &lt;tlir&gt; ofcourse I can also install both zenoss and puppet or something else and use 2 screens to configure the different things (one for monitoring and one for scheduling) but that's just ugly</p><p>[24-Mar-2010 14:36:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm sure there's some expensive enterprise app out there that can do both</p><p>[24-Mar-2010 14:36:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; but not with any open source app that I've seen</p><p>[24-Mar-2010 14:36:46] &lt;rmatte&gt;

venturaville: I think you are too strict with your definitions</p><p>[24-Mar-2010 14:39:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; then use that list to do something</p><p>[24-Mar-2010 14:39:18] &lt;tlir&gt; venturaville: firstly, it talks about executing a command which is already half way</p><p>[24-Mar-2010 14:39:25] &lt;rmatte&gt;

slops17: basically you'll need to have some way for Zenoss to monitor your gear (SNMP, SSH, WMI, etc.).&#160; For network devices, that's usually SNMP</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:07:11] &lt;slops17&gt; do i need an snmp server setup as well?</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:10:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so SNMP is a service running on your device, whether it's a router, Linux or Windows box.&#160; It exposes metrics that Zenoss polls</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:11:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; like enabling SSH</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:11:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; with SSHD</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:12:05] &lt;slops17&gt; ok</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:12:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and the community string is essentially the password used to pull those metrics</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:12:29] &lt;slops17&gt; so the zenoss box is the snmp server then?</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:13:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; not exactly.&#160; The Zenoss box is a client to every device that runs the snmp daemon</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:13:30] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so it's the client, everything else is a server</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:13:54] &lt;slops17&gt; ah ok now i understand</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:14:03] &lt;slops17&gt; that makes more sense now</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:14:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

where Zenoss would be the endpoint</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:14:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, it's a little different, but once you get into it it's a very widespread standard</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:14:57] &lt;slops17&gt; so system name would be the device name then</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:15:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:15:17] &lt;slops17&gt; system location is where the device is</p><p>[25-Mar-2010 15:15:30] &lt;slops17&gt;

I've still only modified the modeler, and all the collection/etc keeps working (I set the snmpindex since it's the same as the slot number :D)</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:46:37] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Got a link to what this all looks like?</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:46:51] &lt;venturaville&gt; theacolyte: which part?</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:46:53] &lt;Simon4&gt; theacolyte: mray's stuff? or?</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:47:25] &lt;venturaville&gt; Simon4: in theory we could make the check script have an option to choose between SNMP, SSH, and SOAP API</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:47:34] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Ah, I'm seeing what you're saying... your bladecenter provides the info and you're trying to parse it using their SOAP API</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:47:46] &lt;venturaville&gt; supposedly there is a CIMOM one too, but that is just too traumatizing if you aren't ready for it :-)</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:47:52] &lt;Simon4&gt; venturaville: yeah, i was wondering about that</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:48:00] &lt;venturaville&gt; theacolyte: bingo</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:48:11] &lt;Simon4&gt; we have strict infosec requirements, so ssh/snmpv3 are good, other things less so</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:48:26] &lt;Simon4&gt; but we could make it switch based on zproperties or something I'm sure</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:48:44] &lt;venturaville&gt; yep</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:48:56] &lt;venturaville&gt; really really need to learn how to get zenoss to cache a pickled stats object</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:49:01] &lt;venturaville&gt; mrayzenoss: ?</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:49:36] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I can't find it on our .com website</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:49:37] &lt;Simon4&gt; if we do collection via ssh, is that with a zencommand called that does the ssh connection? or can we do it more smoothly than that (using zensshclient or similar)</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:50:04] &lt;Simon4&gt; passing auth parameters as command line arguments to a zencommand kinda defeats the purpose of using ssh a bit</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:50:24] &lt;venturaville&gt; if you break it into a separate modeling plugin then they can coexist</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:50:25] &lt;Simon4&gt;

mrayzenoss: so we'll be able to plug in a "chassis elevation view" then :)</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:52:43] &lt;Simon4&gt; (hopefully)</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:52:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Apachez: yes</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:53:07] &lt;Apachez&gt; :S</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:53:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Apachez: it just means with a few good tickets you can suggest what we should be using</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:54:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the MySQL db isn't usually a problem</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:54:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's the RRD</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:54:35] &lt;venturaville&gt; the mysql DB gets to be a problem when you have very large numbers of events.....</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:54:40] &lt;venturaville&gt; (which is our situation)</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:54:53] &lt;venturaville&gt; and that can be mitigated by very fast disks</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:55:17] &lt;Simon4&gt; mrayzenoss: heh, the mysqldb is the thing that kills us every time</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:55:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, AFAIK we're just using a vanilla installation</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:55:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; even in Enterprise</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:55:50] * Simon4 just had dbops at work build a new one</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:56:01] &lt;Simon4&gt; and it seems much better, even with 12 milllion rows in the history table</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:56:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Simon4: feel free to send that back as a wiki article or a ticket</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:56:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; *cough*</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:56:25] &lt;Simon4&gt; mrayzenoss: I will, giving it a little time to bed in etc</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:56:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm hoping to push for Drizzle in the post-Stone Crab release</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:57:25] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and the RRDTool caching daemon</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:58:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; mrayzenoss: is there a way to manually kick off history event aging?</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:58:26] &lt;Simon4&gt; just dropped the days to keep history for, and want to get it to age things now whilst it's quiet</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:59:02] &lt;Apachez&gt; are there any good reason for why innodb is being used?</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:59:12] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; well, you can adjust the "Delete Historical Events Older Than (days)" and the "Event Aging Threshold (hours)"</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:59:13] &lt;Apachez&gt; myisam should be more lightweight for the purpose its used for</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:59:21] &lt;Simon4&gt; mrayzenoss: yeah, I adjusted that</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:59:30] &lt;Simon4&gt; want to make it actually go and do that though</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:59:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Apachez: we switched from myisam-&gt;innodb about 2 years ago, I don't know the story there</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:59:40] &lt;Simon4&gt; vs it running at some unknown time when I'm in bed</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 14:59:54] &lt;Simon4&gt; we only just switched from myisam, stupid error meant we were still using it</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:00:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; full table locks on things like aging events would destroy the entire box</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:00:15] &lt;Apachez&gt; not really</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:00:30] &lt;Apachez&gt; innodb is really slow to gather large amount of data like the events will store</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:00:42] &lt;Simon4&gt; Apachez: I'm no DBA, but I certainly saw the effects when the aging job was running</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:00:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I think the problem is we haven't taken the time to tune the MySQL side of things.</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:01:07] &lt;ckrough&gt; myisam doesnt allow field locking, innodb does, or something like that</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:01:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the devs who know DBs were hard-core Oracle guys</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:01:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and MySQL "just works" ;P</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:01:40] &lt;Apachez&gt; I have done some tweaks to the config but im too lazy to commit it back to zenoss :P</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:01:50] &lt;Apachez&gt; basically since I switched to splunk + munin :P</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:01:52] &lt;ckrough&gt; what he said: 'it's said that InnoDB works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking'</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:01:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I think since then we've gotten some more MySQL experience in-house, it just hasn't gotten prioritized</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:01:56] &lt;whitemice&gt; buggers: every RDBMS "just works"</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:02:04] &lt;Apachez&gt; but I will have some spare time during easter to do some more tests with zenoss</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:02:27] &lt;Apachez&gt; ckrough: again, not true :)</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:02:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; whitemice: which means everytime someone asks me about running on PostgreSQL/Oracle/blah I can tell them "knock yourself out" :)</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:02:49] &lt;Apachez&gt; but in short terms innodb performs better (IF and I say IF tweaked settings) during high concurrency compared to myisam</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:02:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we're also still on 5.0, which is kinda old</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:03:02] &lt;Apachez&gt; but for logging as with events myisam will most likely perform far better</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:03:04] &lt;whitemice&gt; no; it means that argument for MySQL is crap.&#160; As a multi-DB admin I just find it very annoying "Well, MySQL just works -so I used that".</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:03:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; whitemice: I agree</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:03:33] &lt;whitemice&gt; which means "I couldn't be bothered to think about it"</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:03:43] &lt;Apachez&gt; by the way isnt zenoss enterprise violating the mysql license? ;)</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:03:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; nope, we already went around with them</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:04:06] &lt;Apachez&gt; they have some retarded thing that mysql binaries are not allowed to be included unless you buy a specific redistribution license</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:04:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we use the MySQL the OS provides</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:04:27] &lt;Apachez&gt; but its ok if you include just an install script that will fetch the mysql stuff from mysql.com for the clients</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:04:46] &lt;Simon4&gt; only time you get mysql is if you use the stack installer</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:04:50] &lt;Apachez&gt; I thought mysql was included in the stack?</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:04:54] &lt;venturaville&gt; it is</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:04:56] &lt;Simon4&gt; the rpm installer assumes you've already gotten yourself some sql</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:04:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it is, most customers use RPM</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:05:14] * Simon4 was assuming that enterprise would have been RPM, not stack</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:05:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; again, more fuel for Drizzle :)</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:05:39] &lt;ckrough&gt; heh</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:05:57] &lt;ckrough&gt; every time I hear it I think of Master Shake</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:06:03] &lt;ckrough&gt; The Driiiiizzzle</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:06:11] &lt;Apachez&gt; I would expect a deb as enterprise :)</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:11:34] &lt;Simon4&gt; hurrah, events finally aging, and it's not blocking the whole table</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:12:42] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; seriously though, I'm pretty sure there's been next to no tuning on the DB so please submit tickets or wiki articles and we'll try to squeeze a little more out of the db</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:12:57] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and Stone Crab will still be on MySQL 5.0</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:13:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; even though some users are using 5.1 and 5.4</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:30:37] &lt;Simon4&gt; mmmm, kiwi beer and python... my Friday nights are getting a bit geeky of late</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:33:04] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt; anyone know why i get this&#160; /bin/bash: /root/.bashrc: Permission denied when i run anything logged in as zenoss</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:34:03] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt; so installing a zenpack from a fresh install is a bit of a challenge</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:34:09] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; are you using su?</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:34:23] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt; yep</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:34:27] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt; su zenoss</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:34:30] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 'su - zenoss'</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:35:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

I'm just glad it was something I knew</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:36:35] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt; that works great</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:36:57] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt; well be carefull i may have plently more if this zenpack doesnt show</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:37:06] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt; thanks for helping</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:37:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; mrayzenoss: with modeler plugins, is there something somewhere in the zenpack to register them? or do they just need to exist under modeler/plugins/whatnot.py?</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:38:43] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt; do you know if i can monitor windows services on boxes on the vanilla install or do i need a wmi zenpack</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:38:54] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; sevices are out of the box</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:39:07] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Simon4: don't know, haven't dug into that yet</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:39:18] &lt;Simon4&gt; mrayzenoss: hokay, I'll do a quick experiment</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:42:34] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt; i take it if your zenpack doesnt show in the gui zenpacks installed bit its not installed properly</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:43:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; that's correct</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:43:20] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt; lol great</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:43:45] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt; ive installed it through cli and it said installed and done a zenoss restart</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:46:07] &lt;Zaphodthe3rd&gt;

cool</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 15:52:46] &lt;Simon4&gt; now to actually put contents into the modeller code</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 16:11:36] &lt;Simon4&gt; w00t, now modelling all the fans within a bladechassis</p><p>[26-Mar-2010 16:11:57] &lt;Simon4&gt;

also, read the Zenoss Admin guide in it's entirety if you haven't</p><p>[29-Mar-2010 14:17:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; It'll explain about 90% of the stuff you're likely to ask in here</p><p>[29-Mar-2010 14:20:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; Just a hint, if you click on an interface in Zenoss you'll notice that Zenoss is aware of both the ifindex and the name</p><p>[29-Mar-2010 14:20:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you can make use of that in the transform</p><p>[29-Mar-2010 14:27:03] &lt;Brixius&gt;

well, the map is going to be extremely intensive to load with thousands of locations</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:23:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; the rest is dependant on what you're monitoring on each modem</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:23:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it's ping only then it'll be fine</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:24:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you're doing a fair bit of snmp monitoring for each you'll want to look in to remote collectors</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:28:02] &lt;ckrough&gt;

how so?</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:46:10] &lt;ckrough&gt; for now, 2.5.2 is behaving much differently</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:46:56] &lt;ckrough&gt; one of the problems is that zenping rebuilds its tree per-daemon, so when you are running multiple daemons and hubs, the hubs eat all your ram and swap</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:47:04] &lt;ckrough&gt; didnt happen in dev, but it's happening in prod...</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:47:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; that blows because I already have memory issues with 2.4.5</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:47:52] &lt;ckrough&gt; we patched PingConfig.py so that the master box does all the pining</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:47:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I don't want worse memory issues with 2.5.2</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:48:06] &lt;ckrough&gt; rather than each collector, but still ahving memory issues</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:48:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's getting to the point where it's ridiculous</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:48:35] &lt;QbY&gt; rmatte: sorry for the delay, on each modem we'd colect about 4 snmp points. plus, one is gotta come from the cmts, so i don't know how i'm going to do that</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:49:04] &lt;ckrough&gt; after all the configs and ping trees are built it seems ok, but it takes over an hour to get going if you restart</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:49:08] &lt;ckrough&gt; thats no good</p><p>[30-Mar-2010 15:50:49] &lt;venturaville&gt;

will it provide more information ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 06:15:48] &lt;fus10nx&gt; on the Zen interface I mean</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 06:15:59] &lt;chemist&gt; yes, a lot more</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 06:16:30] &lt;chemist&gt; I would change the 'public' string to something else anyway</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 06:20:59] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ok</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 06:21:15] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i wish this would run on windows nativly, the server end</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 06:21:27] &lt;fus10nx&gt; that would just be the best, then i wouldnt need to get linux involved at all</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 06:21:43] &lt;fus10nx&gt; not that i am against linux, i love it personally, but all of our clients are windwos based</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 06:49:10] &lt;fus10nx&gt; where do I modify the community name?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 06:49:18] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i tried in /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:25:15] &lt;fus10nx&gt; Simon4: do you where I can change the SNMP community name ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:31:48] &lt;Simon4&gt; fus10nx: in the zproperties of the device, or the device class</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:31:57] &lt;Simon4&gt; if you set the device class ones, it affects all devices in that class</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:32:36] &lt;fus10nx&gt; what do you mean zproperties ? is that on the web interface?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:32:55] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, on the web interface</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:33:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; say if you navigate to "devices/windows/server"</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:33:21] &lt;Simon4&gt; you'll see a tab called "zProperties"</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:33:39] &lt;fus10nx&gt; oh oh oh</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:33:58] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ahhhh ok i see how this works now</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:34:20] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so there's some predefined classes but you can make your own</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:40:56] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:40:58] &lt;Simon4&gt; exactly</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:41:20] &lt;Simon4&gt; the predefined ones are a good starter, since they have both zproperties set appropriately, and also appropriate performance templates bound</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:43:03] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya I'll play around with that</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:43:13] &lt;fus10nx&gt; for some reason zendisc always reigsters as orange</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:43:15] &lt;fus10nx&gt; and i cant figure out why</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:43:25] &lt;fus10nx&gt; IpRouteEntry is Green</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 07:43:51] &lt;fus10nx&gt; IpInterface = Green , IP address (ping I think) is blue, zendisc is orange</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:08:13] &lt;fus10nx&gt; Anyone else alive who can give a hand ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:13:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; fus10nx: when you add/model a device, see if there are any errors in the output</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:13:21] * Simon4 runs away again, stupid work getting in the way</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:13:52] &lt;fus10nx&gt; haha ok</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:14:02] &lt;fus10nx&gt; well ive just been using autodiscover</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:34:19] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:37:38] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so pretty much to get any useful information from windows like hardware, software, etc. you need a zenpack</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:40:46] forsberg is now known as fOrsberg</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:42:11] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:42:18] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so pretty much to get any useful information from windows like hardware, software, etc. you need a zenpack</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:42:21] &lt;fus10nx&gt; err sorry</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:50:10] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ohhhhhhhhh so ZenOSS is like What's Up Gold kind of</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:55:36] &lt;Apachez&gt; fus10nx: unless its standard snmp</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:55:52] &lt;Apachez&gt; however ossim might be something useful aswell</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:56:34] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ossim</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:56:43] &lt;Apachez&gt; the downside with zenoss (in my opinion) is the non optimized db settings along with some old python which uses (whatever the name is of that application webserver) singlethreaded stuff so its really slow compared to other solutions</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:56:45] &lt;fus10nx&gt; hmmm ok, I would just like to populate like software, hardware, event, etc.</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:57:07] &lt;fus10nx&gt; for a free solution its absolutely amazing</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:57:08] &lt;Apachez&gt; but if you can live with that (and most people can) then zenoss is great :)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:57:10] &lt;fus10nx&gt; much better than nagios</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:57:14] &lt;Apachez&gt; yup :)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:57:22] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so do you use the wmi stuff? the zenpacks?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:57:29] &lt;fus10nx&gt; im just trying to figure out how to install them</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:57:35] &lt;Apachez&gt; specially since both syslogging and graphing is included</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:57:46] &lt;Apachez&gt; like with cacti you only get graphing (along with some bugs=</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:57:49] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya i cant seem to get my event log information or hardware or software</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:58:05] &lt;Apachez&gt; nope I just used vanilla zenoss</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:58:09] &lt;Apachez&gt; the stack install</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:58:20] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so you get like super basic info. from windows devices</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:58:22] &lt;Apachez&gt; I tried a couple of zenpacks but non that got my attention</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:58:35] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i was told that hte WMI stuff would provide loads more information</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:58:51] &lt;Apachez&gt; in my case I monitor a bunch of switches/routers (snmp both polling and traps) and get logs from them (syslog)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:58:59] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ahhh i see</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:59:07] &lt;fus10nx&gt; 95% of our stuff would be windows based</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:59:13] &lt;Apachez&gt; and then I have a couple of "SLA" monitors like ping latency towards a couple of sites</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:59:18] &lt;fus10nx&gt; are installing zenpacks a bit of a pain ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 08:59:26] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ahhh i see</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:01:10] &lt;Apachez&gt; well backup is always good if you want to store history data</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:01:21] &lt;Apachez&gt; since not all packs are that good in install/uninstall</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:01:29] &lt;Apachez&gt; but usually its really easy</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:01:35] &lt;Apachez&gt; you upload the pack and activate it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:01:36] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya i've already imaged my working machine just a few minutes ago</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:01:43] &lt;fus10nx&gt; simple as that ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:01:49] &lt;Apachez&gt; sometimes you need to restart the zenoss to make the pack appear</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:02:07] &lt;Apachez&gt; (not restart the whole box but the zenoss core process which restarts all zenoss related stuff)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:02:07] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ill give it a shot, if i break it, i've got a backup any how</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:02:17] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:02:17] &lt;Apachez&gt; clonezilla is your friend ;)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:02:21] &lt;fus10nx&gt; haha</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:02:23] &lt;fus10nx&gt; acronis here</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:02:38] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so is there a specific place they need to be uploaded to ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:02:54] &lt;Apachez&gt; ehm</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:02:56] &lt;Apachez&gt; readme :)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:03:50] &lt;fus10nx&gt; haha ok ill give it a shot</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:04:01] &lt;fus10nx&gt; egg files :)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:08:07] &lt;fus10nx&gt; well, thats frickin easy though the interface</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:08:11] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i love simple software</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:11:33] &lt;fus10nx&gt; I just install the WMI Data Source -- should it now just automatically start collecting all of the more advanced information from Windows?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:18:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you have to install the performance pack that goes with it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:18:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; to get the device template</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:20:26] &lt;fus10nx&gt; there doesnt seem to be any documentation on this page for it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:20:32] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so its more than just the egg file?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:21:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; no</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:21:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, Egor Puzanov has made several WMI related ZenPacks</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:21:28] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:21:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; all the WMI Data Source pack is is a daemon to collect WMI info, which adds a new datasource type to Zenoss</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:21:56] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ok gotcha</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:21:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; you still actually need a device template that uses that datasource type to collect the data</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:22:11] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so you mean installing additional software on windows ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:22:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; Hence you also want to install the WMI Windows Performance pack by Egor</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:22:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; no</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:22:22] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya i installed both of them</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:22:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you'll obviously need WMI configured on your windows boxes</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:22:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you'll need the WMI username/password set in zProperties as zWinUser and zWinPassword</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:22:50] &lt;fus10nx&gt; isn't that just enabling the service</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:23:01] &lt;fus10nx&gt; bah ok ill have to read up a lot more on WMI then</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:23:10] &lt;fus10nx&gt; I thought it was just enable the service, install zenpack, off you go</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:23:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; well...</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:23:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; the other 2 steps are to get an account that has admin access to all your boxes</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:23:48] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya, domain account which I do have</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:23:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then putting the username and password for that account as zWinUser and zWinPassword in Zenoss</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:24:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; you also need to make sure that the devices are in a group with the WMI device template bound to it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:24:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you just start using Zenoss or have you been using it for a while?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:24:36] &lt;fus10nx&gt; just started, read through entire manual and now trying to use</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:24:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; by the entire manual you mean the Admin Guide?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:24:54] &lt;fus10nx&gt; literally just started about 3 hours ago, read the admin guide through and through</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:25:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:25:05] &lt;fus10nx&gt; but still unclear to me with a lot of stuff, the wording of classes vs. groups and stuff</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:25:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you understand the concept of creating device classes, binding templates to those classes, and setting zProperties for those classes?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:25:26] &lt;fus10nx&gt; before i even installed the software i read through the admin guide fully then re-read most of it and then installed</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:25:41] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i get it for the most part I suppose, its a matter of puttin git into practive</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:25:44] &lt;fus10nx&gt; practice*</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:25:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it's kind of better to follow along in Zenoss as you read the guide</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:25:50] &lt;fus10nx&gt; to me I want to keep calling classes, groups</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:25:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; you absorb more that way</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:26:07] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya thats my next approach, before i fully am sold on it i just wnated to make sure it can in fact do what we need it to</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:26:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you read the whole guide without even having touched the software your brain won't absorb the info well</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:26:20] &lt;fus10nx&gt; which was pretty much the case :)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 09:26:28] &lt;rmatte&gt;

its funny it detects how many cores I have but not the manufacturer, model, speed, ext speed, l1, l2, volts</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:26:05] &lt;fus10nx&gt; it just all shows as unknown or 0</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:26:19] &lt;fus10nx&gt; but it detects the number or cores fine cus i am running this on 6 different machinesd now</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:33:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, there's Ajax in the UI</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:34:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; the dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 mins by default</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:34:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; it detects all that info for certain models of CPU, but not all</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:35:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; it detects the number of physical CPUs, not cores, from what I recall</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:39:00] &lt;fus10nx&gt; well its a single quad core, another single quad core then the rest are dual core</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:39:16] &lt;fus10nx&gt; as in 1 physical CPU in each machine</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:39:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:39:35] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so when reading the admin guide i remember it saying something about install some other SNMP software, did you do that?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:39:38] &lt;fus10nx&gt; some 3rd party software</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:39:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I guess it was hyperthreading that I found threw it off</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:40:19] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya, not sure why it's not getting the model numbers of any but eh, its fine</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:40:38] &lt;fus10nx&gt; the WMI stuff must be working because its getting my events and stuff</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:43:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, event log monitoring is included in Zenoss core</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:43:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not part of that WMI pack</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:50:02] &lt;fus10nx&gt; hmm ok</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:50:10] &lt;fus10nx&gt; well do you know that 3rd party thing i'm refering to?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:50:48] &lt;fus10nx&gt; basically i did the zProperties for the /Server/Windows class and added in a bunch of community.wmi items</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:50:53] &lt;fus10nx&gt; in the zCollectorPlugins section</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:52:06] &lt;fus10nx&gt; memoryAvailableKBytes, memoryPagesPerSec, cpuPercentProcessorTime - those are all greyed out in the component type under a specific devices status</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:52:41] charlieS_ is now known as charlieS</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 10:54:23] &lt;fus10nx&gt; Error reading value for "memoryAvailableKBytes" on 192.168.0.2 (oid.1.3.6.1.4.1.9600.1.1.2.2.0 is bad)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:06:53] &lt;fus10nx&gt;&#160; SNMP informant</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:08:01] Absenth is now known as Absenth_AWAY</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:15:29] &lt;fus10nx&gt; does ZenOSS have issues w/ 64-bit operating system installs?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:20:35] &lt;Brixius&gt; I have a question, possibly a bug, when I move a device from one class to another the events that that device had do not rollup under the new device class it was moved to, instead they stay under the old device class it had prior to moving it.&#160; Is this by design?</p><p><span>[31-Mar-2010 11:22:19] &lt;lthrasher&gt; hmm, interesting: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://tinyurl.com/ydv55rl">http://tinyurl.com/ydv55rl</a></p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:22:24] &lt;Brixius&gt; New events that are recieved post move, do rollup to the new device class.</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:23:20] &lt;fus10nx&gt; do you need SNMP informant to get the memoryAvailableKBytes ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:24:31] &lt;Brixius&gt; fus10nx: yes you do</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:24:49] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ahh ok</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:24:50] &lt;Brixius&gt; fus10nx: just the free one on their site</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:24:55] &lt;fus10nx&gt; that stinks but fair enough</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:25:25] &lt;Brixius&gt; I agree, it's one more thing to install on every server prepped... But it's quick enough to install</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:25:31] &lt;fus10nx&gt; true</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:26:52] &lt;Brixius&gt; I'm guessing you could use ZenPacks.community.WMIDataSource to get the info and graph it using a wmi query, but to get it from snmp you need informant.</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:27:27] &lt;Brixius&gt; that didn't come out right, er... Get the data with a wmi query and graph it...</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:28:27] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya i did the WMI stuff too but apparently somethings not working properly</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:29:32] &lt;Brixius&gt; I was having problems with it until I found out that my windows password and username that zen was using had "special" characters in them.</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:38:47] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ahhh I see</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 11:39:02] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ours did and i changed it just to be safe for testing so it's not that, i get some weird messages</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:05:03] &lt;QbY&gt; i'm trying to build a transform.. and using an "If" statement--but what i'm finding is, if it doesn't meet the first if statemnet, it doesn't alarmm.</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:09:09] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i'm just trying to get the thing to work as I want it to :)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:37:15] &lt;fus10nx&gt; is there some advantage to using SNMP v2c or v3 over v1 ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:38:21] &lt;fus10nx&gt; excluding security, will i get more info. from v2c or v3 ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:49:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; v1 is older, v2 is newer, but as far as monitoring goes there isn't really a difference</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:50:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; v3 is encrypted and requires a username/password</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:50:05] &lt;fus10nx&gt; thanks</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:50:12] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i re-read admin guide, MUCH better understanding now</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:50:17] &lt;fus10nx&gt; locations, groups, classes, etc.</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:50:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; not many devices support v3 from what I've seen though</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:50:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; v2c is the most common</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:50:24] &lt;fus10nx&gt; once you get a good grip of it, its not that bad</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:50:26] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:50:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:50:34] &lt;fus10nx&gt; it was set to v1 so ive gone to v2c</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:51:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; QbY: explain your transform problems a bit clearer and fpaste.org it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:51:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; I generally use v2c unless a device doesn't support it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:51:53] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:52:04] &lt;fus10nx&gt; locations was a bit tricky to understand but pretty sure i got it now</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:52:21] &lt;fus10nx&gt; like is organizer supposed to be a company name ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:53:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; organizer can be anything you want</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:53:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; however you want to organize devices other than by class, group, or location</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:53:30] &lt;fus10nx&gt; I'm just trying to think like "Company" --&gt; "Physical Location" --&gt; "Groups in there" --&gt; "Devices"</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:53:51] &lt;fus10nx&gt; see, location was confusing because I'm thinking like /Server/Windows</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:53:53] &lt;fus10nx&gt; not physical location</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:54:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; There's Locations, Groups, Systems, and Device Classes</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:54:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; they can all be used to categorize devices</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:54:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; Location is physical location</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:54:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; aka an address</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:55:11] &lt;fus10nx&gt; well then its really confusing</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:55:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; locations are used by the google maps portlet</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:55:30] &lt;fus10nx&gt; because if you "set location" it asks where you want to me it to and only option I have at the moment is "/</p><p><span>[31-Mar-2010 12:55:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can end up with something like: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dmon.org/graphics/zenoss/gen2.png">http://dmon.org/graphics/zenoss/gen2.png</a></p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:55:46] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya that's sick</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:55:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's because you can create locations at different levels</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:55:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; I personally create them all at the first level</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:56:01] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:56:11] &lt;fus10nx&gt; let me give this a try</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:56:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you can have locations for cities then drill down to sites in each city if you want</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:56:13] &lt;fus10nx&gt; I've got Nottingham first</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:56:44] &lt;fus10nx&gt; So go to "Browse By" then locations then add a sub-location ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:56:46] &lt;fus10nx&gt; is that the process</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:57:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I create my locations like: /100 east first street, whatever, state, zipcode</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:57:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; and so on, all on the root level</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:57:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; but to each his own</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:57:30] &lt;fus10nx&gt; that seems logical to me</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:57:37] &lt;fus10nx&gt; but was it "sub-locations" thats whats confusing</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:57:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; the reason I do it that way is because only 1 level is viewable on the map at one time</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:57:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I like to see the layout of all sites</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:57:48] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya for sure</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:58:05] &lt;fus10nx&gt; but really its labeled "sub locations"</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:58:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it's a sub-location of the / organizer</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:58:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; technically</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:58:40] &lt;fus10nx&gt; right</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:58:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; then if you were to create a sub-location under one of those it would be a sublocation of /&lt;address&gt;</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:59:06] &lt;fus10nx&gt; right, exactly</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 12:59:59] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so what do you typically call your "organizer"</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:00:15] &lt;fus10nx&gt; the name of the business where they are? Like "ABC Company - NYC" "ABC Company - London"</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:00:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I have dedicated Zenoss servers for each business</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:00:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I just put the address of each site</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:01:06] &lt;fus10nx&gt; I gotcha -- but let's say it's 20 companies and each has 10 locations..."ABC Company" -- "London" -- "10 whatever street"</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:01:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; whatever works for you</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:01:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; also... just a heads up</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:01:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; as you create each organizer, click on the organizer</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:01:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; at the top you'll see an Address field</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:01:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; click the [Edit] link next to it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:01:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; and enter in the address of the site there</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:02:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what's used to plot the location on the google map</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:02:20] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya, cool man, you've been a HUGE help</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:02:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; ;)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:02:36] &lt;fus10nx&gt; I got it now</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:02:38] &lt;fus10nx&gt; sickness</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:03:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; you've still got tons to learn lol but if you're liking it now, wait until you figure out some of the other stuff you can do with it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:03:10] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ha, awesome -- /Locations/Sony/London&#160; -- /Locations/Sony/Nottingham -- /Locations/Sony/New York</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:03:27] &lt;fus10nx&gt; then "4th level" is address</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:03:29] &lt;fus10nx&gt; awesome</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:03:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; well... you can do it that way...</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:03:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you're going to have to put an address for each organizer</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:03:51] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya ya</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:03:55] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so it's 4 levels</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:04] &lt;fus10nx&gt; company name, town/city, address</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:08] &lt;fus10nx&gt; then "Locations" at the top</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; then on your map you'll see "Sony", then you'll click on that and that'll take you down another level and show you London, Nottingham, New York</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:23] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ohhhhhhhhh</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; then when you click on one of those it'll take you to the next level and show the locations</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:29] &lt;fus10nx&gt; thats why you said you do it all at main level</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; you won't actually see them all at the same level unless you create all of them at the main level</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:36] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i got it now</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:38] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ill try it both ways</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is what I was explaining ;)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:04:57] &lt;fus10nx&gt; its just some of the verbage is confusing</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:05:00] &lt;fus10nx&gt; "organizer"</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:05:01] &lt;fus10nx&gt; heh</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:05:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; organizer is just a fancy way to say folder, directory, class, whatever</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:05:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just somewhere to plop devices under to categorize them</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:05:53] &lt;fus10nx&gt; yup</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:06:05] &lt;fus10nx&gt; shit thats sick how quick it plots them though, i gotta say</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:06:05] &lt;fus10nx&gt; slick</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:06:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:06:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; is it complaining about an API key at all, or did you already add one in?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:06:43] &lt;fus10nx&gt; did that already</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:06:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; k cool</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:06:50] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ive used google maps in the past a buncha times</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:06:54] &lt;fus10nx&gt; the API rather</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:06:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah k</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:07:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; by the way, if you don't know Python you'll want to learn a bit</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:07:20] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ok i got it now, fully got it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:07:27] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya we have a few python dev's here</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:07:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:07:40] &lt;fus10nx&gt; cus we made our own piece of software, i gotta show them this tomorrow -- hopefully we can integrate the two easily</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:08:06] &lt;fus10nx&gt; we'd have the most ultimate system at that point, this was what was missing and we were going to develop but obv. this is MUCH further ahead, it would compliment our software so well</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:08:21] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i just dont get how they can give it away for free, baffels me</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:08:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, they do have the enterprise version</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:08:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; which has even more features</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:08:52] &lt;fus10nx&gt; haha ya</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:08:56] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i just wonder how the license works</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:09:03] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i.e. can we integrate this and sell it as our solution</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:09:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; for enterprise?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:09:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, Zenoss Core is bound by the GPL</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:09:31] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ahhh ok, so enterprise is needed</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:09:36] &lt;fus10nx&gt; wonder how much it is</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:09:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you couldn't "sell" enterprise</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:10:02] &lt;fus10nx&gt; we want to just integrate this into our software and sell our software</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:10:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss licenses enterprise for a yearly fee</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:10:16] &lt;fus10nx&gt; gotcha</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:10:21] &lt;fus10nx&gt; do you know what that fee is?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:10:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's based on the amount of devices you monitor</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:10:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt you'll ever be able to resell Zenoss</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:10:56] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ill have to get in touch w/ these guys</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:11:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; they don't really do business that way</p><p><span>[31-Mar-2010 13:11:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/product/pricing">http://www.zenoss.com/product/pricing</a></p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:11:41] &lt;fus10nx&gt; damn thats cheap</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:12:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; compared to other products, yes</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:16:23] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so have you done anything at all w/ the WMI stuff?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:16:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've used WMI in the past, but not recently</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:17:05] &lt;fus10nx&gt; did you have to install anything additional in windows?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:17:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need the WMI agent installed</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:17:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; fus10nx: actually Zenoss does have folks who handle partnerships, so if you've got something you want to talk about I can get you some email addresses</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:17:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; there you have it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:17:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; ^^</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:17:49] &lt;fus10nx&gt; that would be fantastic, I just left a message for a women named Pam in the Maryland office</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:18:06] &lt;fus10nx&gt; but if it's better directed elsewhere, that would be very helpful as we're keen to have an integrated product like this</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:18:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you have Python devs they'll find that Zenoss is quite easy to integrate with pretty much anything</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:18:46] &lt;fus10nx&gt; thats even better news</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:18:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; fus10nx: Pam's our marketing manager</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:19:25] &lt;fus10nx&gt; Can I trust that she's the correct person to be speaking with or should I direct my questins elsewhere?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:19:41] &lt;fus10nx&gt; rmatte: if I set the address 3 levels down, it should still plot on the Google maps, right?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:19:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; not at the top level</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:20:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; you would have to set an address for each level and drill down to it by clicking through</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:20:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only way to get them to plot at the top level is to create the organizer at the top level</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:20:50] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so I've got that in there and then on the last set there, the canal side, i actually filled in the address information</p><p><span>[31-Mar-2010 13:21:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; fus10nx: why don't you email me and I'll help get you sorted out.&#160;

I'll look for it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:26:56] &lt;fus10nx&gt; rmatte: what if I dont even care about seeing those levels on the map</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:26:59] &lt;fus10nx&gt; its a bit confusing</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:27:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; well...</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:27:16] &lt;fus10nx&gt; again, the only place I put in an address is the 4th level, canal stuff</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:27:33] &lt;fus10nx&gt; shouldn't that just plot it-self on the map and not the levels above it</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:27:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you want to use the map portlet you have no choice...</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:27:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; but...</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:28:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can drill right down to a level under Locations and click the Map tab</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:28:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then you'll see the locations</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:28:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you can do it one way or another</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:28:28] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i gotcha but not the portlet</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:28:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, the portlet is a global view</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:28:44] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i got it now, thanks</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:28:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:31:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can do multiple google map portlets at different levels</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:31:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ie. global, usa, europe, etc.</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:31:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah yeh, I guess you can</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:31:56] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ahhh ok,</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:31:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; click on the little asterisk</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:32:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; then pick the level (I forgot about that)</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:32:20] &lt;fus10nx&gt; im still trying to figur eout why its not reporting the correct CPU's on any machines even with some machines have that 3rd party SNMP software</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:32:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; it won't</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:32:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; it just doesn't have enough CPU definitions in it's database</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:32:51] &lt;fus10nx&gt; why not?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:32:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; something that needs updating</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:33:01] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ahhh ok</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:33:07] &lt;fus10nx&gt; i thought maybe it was just on my 64-bit systems</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:33:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; nope</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:33:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; it works for some, won't work for others</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:33:35] &lt;fus10nx&gt; at least all the graphs are working now, at least on the ones that have the 3rd party SNMP software, gonna try it on the stock windows ones momentarily</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:34:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; 3rd party SNMP software?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:34:23] &lt;fus10nx&gt; I *think* I got the WMI stuff working in conjunction w/ the SNMP stuff</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:34:26] &lt;fus10nx&gt; ya its in the admin guide</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:34:27] &lt;rmatte&gt;

potentially somewhere in the range of 50-60K so I am trying to go all stock</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:35:10] &lt;fus10nx&gt; lots of different clients</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:35:31] &lt;fus10nx&gt; sort of like an outsoruced NOC</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:35:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; you want to monitor 50000 to 60000 devices on a single installation?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:35:35] &lt;fus10nx&gt; haha no no</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:35:37] &lt;fus10nx&gt; course not</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:35:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, I was asking about per installation</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:36:01] &lt;fus10nx&gt; this test is just for like 20 machines</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:36:14] &lt;fus10nx&gt; largest site would be about 7500 machines roughly</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:36:19] &lt;fus10nx&gt; obv. multiple servers to mix up teh load</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:38:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; you just looking for CPU and Memory utilization per device?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:38:57] &lt;fus10nx&gt; events as well, hard disk, etc.</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:39:02] &lt;fus10nx&gt; most common stuff really</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:39:57] &lt;fus10nx&gt; so the graphs, it's a 300 second (5 min) delay ?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:41:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, but events and hard disk are handled by Zenoss itself</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:41:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm talking about for stuff on the performance tab</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:41:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; is CPU and Memory enough?</p><p>[31-Mar-2010 13:42:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm asking because the following ZenPacks that I put together are capable of monitoring CPU and Memory via SNMP without requiring SNMP Informant...</p><p><span>[31-Mar-2010 13:42:16] &lt;rmatte&gt;
