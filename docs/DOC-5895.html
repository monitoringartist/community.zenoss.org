the most direct way is to uncomment portions of the template until the issue goes away</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:10:32] &lt;npmccallum&gt; that will tell you what object is throwing that exception</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:10:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; which template?</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:10:57] &lt;npmccallum&gt; which ever template is rendering to the screen</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:10:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; you mean the zProperties page itself?</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:11:08] &lt;rmatte&gt;

zProperties</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:12:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; then even without editing anything if I click Save I get the traceback</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:12:06] &lt;npmccallum&gt; traceback</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:12:16] &lt;npmccallum&gt; right, so its trying to do the write</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:12:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; If I __delattr__ for zWinPassword and zWinUser then it saves fine</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:12:32] &lt;npmccallum&gt; and failing because the attribute already exists but doesn't appear to be a zproperty</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:12:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; right</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:12:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; so deleting the already existing attribute shouldn't hurt anything because it'll be recreated if needed on next save?</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:12:59] &lt;npmccallum&gt; I don't believe delattr breaks anything</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:13:14] &lt;npmccallum&gt; I think you're safe to run it against all your devices</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:13:16] &lt;npmccallum&gt; HOWEVER</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:13:19] &lt;npmccallum&gt; back up first</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:13:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, so now I just need some zendmd code to go through and remove the attributes if they exist</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:13:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; I will</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:13:43] &lt;npmccallum&gt;

it'll be interesting to see if it fixes that too</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:16:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; (for future device adds I mean)</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:16:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll have to test afterwards</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:25:40] &lt;voxter&gt;&#160; I guess it must be true that by default, zenoss does not do ping perf graphs? for latency and loss, etc?</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:27:04] &lt;voxter&gt; ahh. just throughput, packets, and errors. not latency</p><p>[03-May-2010 13:49:41] &lt;rmatte&gt;

there are some zenpacks for doing ping graphing</p><p><span>[03-May-2010 14:15:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; such as: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3467.html">docs/DOC-3467</a></p><p>[03-May-2010 14:15:22] &lt;voxter&gt;

If i knew enough about building graphs i would make it myself, but i am still just getting my feet wet</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:15:49] &lt;voxter&gt; it combines latency and packet loss into a single graph</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:15:55] &lt;voxter&gt; incredibly ingeniously</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:16:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; that would take 2 seconds to do with that fping zenpack</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:16:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; just add the packet loss graphpoint to the latency and loss graph</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:16:30] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you see how each reporting cycle is represented in a "bar" most are green, in this graph two are blue</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:17:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, I see what you're saying</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:17:53] &lt;voxter&gt; blue = 1/20 packets lost (as represented by the graph at the bottom)</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:08] &lt;voxter&gt; the bar is drawn as a line in the graph where AVG RTT is</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, Zenoss doesn't support that type of graphing</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; just line or area</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:21] &lt;voxter&gt; MAX rtt and MIN rtt are above and below</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:26] &lt;rhettardo&gt; ah yes.&#160; i use a template similar to smokeping in cacti</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could do it with lines but it wouldn't look quite as nice</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:31] &lt;ckrough&gt; you can do ticks in zenoss too</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; ckrough: oh?</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:40] &lt;ckrough&gt; hwpredict does it</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:45] &lt;voxter&gt; ticks = individual colored bars?</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:48] &lt;ckrough&gt; ya</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:18:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool, didn't know that</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:19:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; is it all done via UI or do you have to do some special config?</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:19:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never seen the option</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:19:14] &lt;ckrough&gt; custom config in the graph</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:19:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:19:19] &lt;voxter&gt; you should be able to achieve this then... decide your color based on a percentage calculated from loss</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:19:28] &lt;voxter&gt; ckrough: do you have an example that I might be able to follow that does this?</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:19:29] &lt;ckrough&gt; you can put just about anything rrdtool supports, to my knowledge</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:19:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, pain in the rear though</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:19:41] &lt;ckrough&gt; not anymore, but used to have them in the past</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:19:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless you're an rrdtool guru</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:19:52] &lt;ckrough&gt; its not too bad</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:20:06] &lt;voxter&gt; I wonder if you do it once, if you can save those custom mods in a zenpack?</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:20:17] &lt;voxter&gt; so that anyone else wishing to do it doesnt have to also do the 'custom mod'</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:20:22] &lt;ckrough&gt; yeah, they become part of the templat</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:20:26] &lt;ckrough&gt; +e</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:20:27] &lt;voxter&gt; and so that it lasts through upgrades.</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:20:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; voxter: yeh, there's a spot right in the graph to specify rrd options</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:20:34] &lt;ckrough&gt; yes</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:20:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it would be part of the ZenPack</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:20:43] &lt;voxter&gt; Hmm interesting.</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:21:32] &lt;voxter&gt; So presumably if you were able to do some math on the result of the packet loss (out of 100%) and you could specify varying colors based on varying percentage, then you could get your colored bar</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:21:44] &lt;voxter&gt; and plot that 'tick' using average RTT</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:21:54] &lt;voxter&gt; then use area bars to draw the 'smoke'</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:22:25] &lt;voxter&gt; it eliminates the need for smokeping 100%, and arguably smokeping is an untouchably valuable rrd tool right now</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:22:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it could be done, would just take some dev work by someone knowledgeable enough to do it</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:23:31] &lt;voxter&gt; Ok, so either I can take a stab at it and take possibly up to 3 days and hours of yelling at zenoss/rrd due to my current lack of understanding, or maybe one of you with some familiarity can assist me? :)</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:23:48] &lt;ckrough&gt; hah, queue up them 3 days :)</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:23:57] &lt;ckrough&gt; but Im sure we can get you through the rough spots</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:24:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can assist you with anything to do with actually packaging the zenpack and creating the template, but I don't know rrdtool well enough to know how to do the actual config properly to get what you're wanting</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:24:42] &lt;ckrough&gt; its instant feedback, so you can toy and refresh until you get it right. watch the render.log for errors and bring up the rrdgraph man page and you should be golden</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:24:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:25:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, wouldn't he have to kill the old RRD each time?</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:25:06] &lt;ckrough&gt; also, somewhere in smokeping is the rrdgraph template that creates that graph... steal that</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:25:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; or does it just adjust it on the fly?</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:25:49] &lt;ckrough&gt; ah, yeah, I guess it depends on how many rrds hold the data. i was thinking it was all one</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:25:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, if you can get the rrdgraph template from smokeping that's 50% of the work already done</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:26:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; no point in reinventing the wheel</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:26:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; a smokeping zenpack would be a nice addition</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:27:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; see what you can do, if you run in to snags you can always ask in here, if you need someone to polish the pack up a bit when you're done with it I can do that for you</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:27:52] &lt;ckrough&gt; the fping zenpack shows packet loss by bar color, it's just not rendered like smokeping, so the rras should be there, its just a matter of rrdgraph</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:28:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, if you can modify that pack to do what you want then send it to me I can rename it and credit whoever helped (including the original fping developer)</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:28:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; fping pack developer rather</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:33:47] &lt;voxter&gt; ok Im gonna dig into it here and see what I can find... i guess i should do this as a mod to fping, ya?</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:34:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; it would be the best idea, most of the work will already be done that way</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:34:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; then when you're done modding it I can walk you through saving it, then you can send it to me and I'll rename it (there's quite a bit involved in renaming it)</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:34:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; then I'll fire it back to you and you can submit it</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:36:52] &lt;voxter&gt; OK great.&#160; I'll start by getting my hands dirty in fping and smokeping's RRD.</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:36:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:40:08] &lt;twm1010&gt; I'm so close :|</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:40:18] &lt;twm1010&gt; I can get qpage to send from command line, but zenoss just tells me "failed" :|</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:41:03] &lt;rmatte&gt;

not sure if it support --cycle or not</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:43:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; but if it does, that'll give you a running view of what the daemon is doing</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:43:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh it does support --cycle</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:43:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; so do that</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:44:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; hrmm... nothing scrolling by on me here</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:45:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:48:12] &lt;twm1010&gt; I do get some 'Lock wait timeout exceeded" messages , but thats not unusual</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:48:23] &lt;twm1010&gt; might have something to do with my 29GB mysql database :|</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:48:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're sure that $ZENHOME/bin/sendqpage.sh is executable as zenoss user?</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:51:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; and are you able to manually run qpage -dip [pager] [message] as the zenoss user?</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:51:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; need to make sure it's actually working via commandline before blaming zenoss ;)</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:56:10] &lt;voxter&gt; Question. I've added the fping zenpack.&#160; It appears as though it attaches itself to the /Devices/Server path automatically. but going into the Perf tab of a server in that tree, i see no fping stuff.&#160; Is that because i need to remodel all the devices now that the fping template has been added, or?</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:56:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; no</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:56:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to that class</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:56:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; then go to templates</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:56:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; then from the dropdown select bind templates</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:57:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; then bind that template to that class (best to hold down the ctrl key when doing it so that you don't unbind any templates that are already bound)</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:57:05] &lt;voxter&gt; oh i see. they are just listed as available, not necessarily bound.</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:57:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:57:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; it gives more flexibility that way</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:57:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can create a template at the root level and only bind it to the classes that you want to</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:58:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; I would expect that template to be available at the root level</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:58:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; it would be weird if it was only available under the server class</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:58:26] &lt;voxter&gt; right.</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:58:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:58:39] &lt;voxter&gt; interesting that when you go to Perf, you have to rely on the graph heading to see what template is providing it..</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:59:04] &lt;voxter&gt; For example i have a couple ping-like templates attached right now, and two of them extend a graph called "Packet loss" im not sure which one is from which. :P</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:59:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it just looks cleaner that way</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:59:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never personally lost track of what's providing what</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:59:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh well, you wouldn't normally run in to a situation like that</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:59:39] &lt;voxter&gt; Fair enough. i guess its only confusing if you are testing out templates that each provide similar data</p><p>[03-May-2010 14:59:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:00:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; you really should just unbind the other template to avoid confusion</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:00:26] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte: ah ha</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:00:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; twm1010: hm?</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:00:35] &lt;twm1010&gt; correct, i was doing my qpage tests as root</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:00:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:00:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, permissions issue was the most likely thing</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:00:57] &lt;twm1010&gt; perhaps i should configure the daemon to run as zenoss user?</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:01:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; well... that doesn't seem to be necessary from what I'm reading in the guide</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:01:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; the zenoss user just needs to be able to execute the qpage command</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:01:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you could, whatever works really</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:02:05] &lt;twm1010&gt; here's my output:</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:02:07] &lt;twm1010&gt;&#160;

if not you may have to try: zenoss ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: qpage</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:10:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure how specific sudo is about exactly how you're executing it</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:10:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; although I'm pretty sure the full path will work fine</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:18:31] &lt;voxter&gt; here's a question, so i enabled fping graphs on a device i monitor right.. zenoss will then monitor that device's IP.&#160; If i wanted, say, fping graphs to also be collected FROM that device (ie instead of the data coming from zenoss -&gt; device, it goes from device -&gt; other ips) i would set up "device" to be a collector and configure a bunch of stuff that way..</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:21:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:21:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; provided the device is a linux box and can actually run as a zenoss collector</p><p>[03-May-2010 15:22:14] &lt;voxter&gt; correct ya.

but display a string instead</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:46:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:46:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, we'll wait and see how the new UI looks when it's finished and then they'll be open to adding stuff like that</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:47:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I'm still rooting for focus on reports</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:47:22] &lt;chemist&gt; the ability to view certain system info on the staus tab would make zenoss 100% what I need</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:47:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; the current reports system is really limited</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:47:49] &lt;chemist&gt; so I'm not alone on that either</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:47:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, you're not</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:48:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; we actually rigged up our own custom report scripts that run outside of Zenoss to generate our monthly reportsd</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:48:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; reports*</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:48:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've written some that do stuff like process availability, interface availability, etc...</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:48:41] &lt;chemist&gt; by interogatting zope externally?</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:48:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I just use python to interface with it</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:48:53] &lt;chemist&gt; *interrogating</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:48:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; basically same as zendmd</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:49:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; then I dump it in csv format, and we have a php script that executes all the necessary scripts, grabs the data, parses it, and formats it</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:49:34] &lt;chemist&gt; nice</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:49:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; We do a disk usage reports, I added an extra columns for current threshold levels</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:50:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; so clients can see what the thresholds are set at at a glance</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:50:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; same for cpu, memory, etc...\</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:50:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'd be great if the majority of that was possible via the UI</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:51:14] &lt;chemist&gt; yes, specially for people like me (green on programming)</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:51:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:51:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wrote the python scripts that we use and my manager wrote the php</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:51:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; it works quite well, but it was a ton of work</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:53:20] &lt;chemist&gt; I can imagine</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:54:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a page with the scripts on the community site, I need to update it since it has older versions of the scripts</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:54:37] &lt;chemist&gt; zenpack development might be too ambitious as my first python project</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:54:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:54:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, my first python projects were writing transforms</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:54:59] * chemist has started some python tutorials</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:55:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; after that I pretty much jumped straight to writing a zenoss daemon</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:55:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:55:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; the daemons works great, couple of small bugs that I intend to fix in the next version</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:55:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the code is sloppier than hell</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:55:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it fits the bill</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:55:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; daemon*</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:55:54] &lt;chemist&gt; yes, I modified a couple of transforms</p><p><span>[03-May-2010 17:56:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dmon.org/zenticket.html">http://dmon.org/zenticket.html</a></p><p>[03-May-2010 17:56:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's when I really delved deep in to python for the first time</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:57:47] &lt;chemist&gt; what ticketing system?</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:58:00] &lt;chemist&gt; otrs? rt?</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:58:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; otrs</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:58:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; a heavily customized version of otrs</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:59:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; We're upgrading to the latest version soon, I was the one who ported all the customizations over from the old version to the new</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:59:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; also had to make some mods of my own</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:59:49] &lt;chemist&gt; they must pay you well :)</p><p>[03-May-2010 17:59:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; funny too since it's all written in perl and dotiac, and I don't really know either of those</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:00:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, I actually get paid crap right now for what I do</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:00:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; still making the same as I was when I was a network analyst here</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:00:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; my 1 year review is coming up very soon though</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:00:32] &lt;chemist&gt; make a nice cv though</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:00:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, my cv is quite nice</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:01:17] &lt;chemist&gt; I use a transform to suppress events if certain device is down</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:01:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm responsible for 13 Zenoss servers (more on the way), OTRS, and ZipTie (config backup system)</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:01:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:01:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; the sky is the limit with transforms</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:02:03] &lt;chemist&gt; but it's random on it's success</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:02:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:02:22] &lt;chemist&gt; some times it works and I only get one event</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:02:35] &lt;chemist&gt; sometimes it doesnt and I get flooded</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:02:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it would really depend on whether the events come in before the transform is run or after</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:03:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; if the down event comes in, the transform runs, finishes, then the other events flood in it's not going to accomplish anything</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:03:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually sorry, the exact opposite</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:03:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; if the events come in before the down event</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:03:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, no, I was the right the first time</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:03:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; but the whole thing is inherently faulty</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:04:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; there has to be a better way to do that</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:04:27] &lt;chemist&gt; proper dependencies would be a good start</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:04:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's another HUGE one on my list</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:04:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; right alongside reports</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:06:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; man, the memory usage on 2.5.2 is infinitely better than it was on 2.4.5</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:07:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm only up to 2GB usage on my largest install after over 5 days, on 2.4.5 I'd be up to 3.5GB</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:07:31] &lt;chemist&gt; yes, those 2 and the custom data on the status tab would make zenoss not the best, but the perfect tool</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:08:05] &lt;chemist&gt; how do you deal with? a sheduled restart of zenoss?</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:08:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; "zenoss restart" lol</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:08:31] &lt;chemist&gt; hehe</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:08:48] &lt;chemist&gt; manually or cron'd?</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:08:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; manually</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:09:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; why would you want to cron it?</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:10:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, the google map isn't working properly on my largest install after the upgrade, figures...</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:11:05] &lt;chemist&gt; I just find zenoss gets sluggish after 4-5 days</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:11:33] &lt;chemist&gt; so I have it restart at 4 am</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:11:54] &lt;chemist&gt; we are only mission critical at certain times</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:12:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:12:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I don't do automated restarts</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:17:15] &lt;rhettardo&gt; im getting all these alerts and i go check the event history and its blank</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:18:30] &lt;rhettardo&gt; i go click on event details in the emails and i get an error :(</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:18:34] &lt;rhettardo&gt; wtf</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:19:10] &lt;chemist&gt; rhettardo: when you click on the event history link it's empty?</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:19:17] &lt;rhettardo&gt; yes</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:19:26] &lt;chemist&gt; 2.5.2?</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:19:38] &lt;rhettardo&gt; coyeah</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:20:24] &lt;rhettardo&gt; yeah...</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:20:36] &lt;rhettardo&gt; damn cat was in front of the monitor and his some keys...</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:20:56] &lt;chemist&gt; Is there a date in the filter toolbar?</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:21:42] &lt;chemist&gt; I found that changing the date to earlier than today gave me the historic events</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:22:18] &lt;chemist&gt; "Last seen" date</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:23:50] &lt;chemist&gt; about the screwy event details, that is beyond me</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:25:48] &lt;chemist&gt; and the cat, get it it's own computer</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:25:57] &lt;chemist&gt; :)</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:27:53] &lt;rhettardo&gt; i have a first seen and last seen date in (yesterday and today) and its still blank</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:28:41] &lt;chemist&gt; is mysql running?</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:29:17] &lt;rhettardo&gt; yup</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:31:08] &lt;rhettardo&gt; im in the history table right now and sorted by date and i dont even see any of alerts in there im getting sent</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:32:00] &lt;rhettardo&gt; this looks like its going to be fun</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:32:17] &lt;chemist&gt; I guess you tried a restart?</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:48:54] &lt;voxter&gt; Is there a defacto guide i should be referencing for setting up a separate zenoss collector, or would this do it?</p><p><span>[03-May-2010 18:48:55] &lt;voxter&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-2496.html">docs/DOC-2496</a></p><p>[03-May-2010 18:50:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; voxter: oh, one sec</p><p><span>[03-May-2010 18:50:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; voila: </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-5861.html">docs/DOC-5861</a></p><p>[03-May-2010 18:51:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; I sent a collector setup ZenPack that I had made to Egor and he made one that's 100x better</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:51:19] &lt;voxter&gt; aha, when it started telling me to edit config files, i figured someone had done this work for me in a more efficient way ;)</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:51:33] &lt;voxter&gt; love zenpacks.</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:51:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you're lucky actually, me and Egor only released our packs quite recently</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:52:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; mine has only been out for a few weeks and Egor's has been out for a few days hehe</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:52:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; Egor's is awesome because it automatically rsyncs the zenpack data as well as RRD data when devices are moved</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:52:55] &lt;voxter&gt; nice!</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:53:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus his has a UI component, mine was all commandline</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:53:07] &lt;voxter&gt; any other amazingly awesome zenpacks that you can suggest?</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:53:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think I'm just going to have Matt mark my pack is obsolete</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:53:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it depends on what you're looking to do</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:53:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; Egor's WMI Data Source pack allows you to fully model windows servers via WMI</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:53:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is neat since it was previously an enterprise-only feature</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:54:03] &lt;voxter&gt; oh nice. i was just about to ask about modelling a couple windows servers!</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:54:06] &lt;voxter&gt; I'll check that out too</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:54:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; The predictive threshold pack can be nice too</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:54:20] &lt;voxter&gt; im eagerly waiting for the Xen zenpack that these university students are doing for their thesis</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:54:23] &lt;voxter&gt; it sounds pretty awesome.</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:54:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:54:31] &lt;voxter&gt; I am using the one thats available now but arguably its pretty basic</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:54:42] &lt;voxter&gt; predictive threshold.. nice.. thats pretty important</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:54:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, if you want to monitor Xen for the time being, the libvirt pack is great for that</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:55:10] &lt;voxter&gt; I was thinking about that, if you dont go and tell zenoss all your thresholds, you dont get useful alerts.</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:55:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, and if you prefer to monitor windows via SNMP (as I do) you can use my packs...</p><p><span>[03-May-2010 18:55:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3386.html">docs/DOC-3386</a></p><p>[03-May-2010 18:55:21] &lt;voxter&gt; and at that, your thresholds might be complete guesses</p><p><span>[03-May-2010 18:55:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3570.html">docs/DOC-3570</a></p><p>[03-May-2010 18:55:41] &lt;voxter&gt; for example I want to be alerted if one ethernet link exceeds 4mbit which wouldnt be normal for people</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:55:55] &lt;voxter&gt; I'm curious about tresholds that are like... alert if this changes more than 40% than normal</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:55:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:56:02] &lt;voxter&gt; i guess thats what predictive thresholds do</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:56:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, sort of, I actually don't fully understand them yet</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:56:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm going to look in to them more soon</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:56:34] &lt;voxter&gt; Im glad i checked zenoss out again. I tried it about 3 years ago and gave up immediately due to its structure complexity</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:56:42] &lt;voxter&gt; i just couldnt wrap my head around it in comparison to cacti and nagios</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:56:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, there are lots of great community zenpacks out there</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:56:49] &lt;voxter&gt; but this time has been much more intuitive</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:56:55] &lt;voxter&gt; I think the zenpacks help alot.</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:57:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; some of them are really low quality though, make sure you try them out on a lab box or something before going prod with them</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:57:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; to make sure it's satisfactory</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:57:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the documentation has gotten a lot better</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:57:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the community is a lot more active</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:57:47] &lt;voxter&gt; i just find that poking around in the UI makes more sense</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:57:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:57:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, wait until the revamped UI lol</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:58:08] &lt;voxter&gt; before you kinda had to know exactly how the structure worked before anything made sense</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:58:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know I'm going to spend a week just finding where they've stuck everything</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:58:33] &lt;voxter&gt; is there a demo/screenshots of the new UI? is it intended to make things more powerful or easier to navigate?</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:59:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; Are you going to be monitoring lots of Cisco stuff?</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:59:06] &lt;voxter&gt; What id like to see more of, is a tiny usage document along with each zenpack, for people starting out, its helpful</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:59:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, yeh there is</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:59:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; one sec</p><p><span>[03-May-2010 18:59:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://public-demo.zenoss.com/">http://public-demo.zenoss.com/</a></p><p>[03-May-2010 18:59:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; login with admin/zenoss</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:59:30] &lt;voxter&gt; For example, when i installed the fping zenpack, i didnt quite realize that it would be made available as a template, but not bound, and that i had to do that</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:59:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:59:48] &lt;voxter&gt; thats something you come to expect once youve done it 10 times, but</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:59:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; just part of the learning process</p><p>[03-May-2010 18:59:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've been working with Zenoss for just over a year</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:00:01] &lt;voxter&gt; oh yeah.... no left menu</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:00:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:00:15] &lt;voxter&gt; wow. it looks great!</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:00:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it looks really good</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:00:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; I personally can't wait</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:00:36] &lt;voxter&gt; i like it when interfaces for this purpose are arranged somewhat like a very interactive excel workbook</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:00:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; aha, they finally started working on the device status page</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:00:57] &lt;voxter&gt; yeah thats what im looking at here.</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:01:28] &lt;voxter&gt; i dunno if groups are a new feature altogether, but thats great how they're laid out</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:01:45] &lt;voxter&gt; Locations, Devices, fantastic</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:02:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, that's in your current version</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:02:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; Groups, Locations, Systems, Devices</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:02:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; all different ways to categorize devices</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:02:46] &lt;voxter&gt; oh, yeah, i see it.</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:02:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; ;)</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:02:53] &lt;voxter&gt; the UI is just much much much nicer in the new version</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:03:00] &lt;voxter&gt; I suppose its probably dangerous to run that in production ;)</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:03:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; the new UI is mostly the same stuff, just new look and organization</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:03:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; at the moment, probably</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:03:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; they have an alpha version to download and mess around with</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:03:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just finished cleaning up the mess from my King Crab upgrades, I'm in no rush to go through that again</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:03:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; ;)</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:04:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are going to be moving to Python 2.6 and a newer version of Zope in that version</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:07:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; and yeh, back to what you were saying about usage documents, we're trying to improve on the quality of them</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:08:12] * rmatte thinks he should rebuild his Cisco Mibs ZenPack soon</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:23:17] &lt;voxter&gt; sorry one sec, phone!</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:34:58] &lt;voxter&gt; sorry back now..</p><p>[03-May-2010 19:35:15] &lt;voxter&gt; I use a decent amount of cisco stuff yeah.

wondering if that is the new look</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:24:43] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, that's it</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:24:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; admin/zenoss is the login</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:25:04] &lt;etank&gt; yeah i checked it out.</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:25:09] &lt;etank&gt; looks pretty rockin</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:30:58] &lt;MTecknology&gt; is zenoss primarily system monitoring?</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:31:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yes</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:31:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; network devices, servers, apps</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:31:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; SNMP, SSH, WMI, JMX, etc.</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:32:07] &lt;MTecknology&gt; what's different between nagios and zenoss?</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:33:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Nagios is primarily availability montiroing</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:33:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so you're probably using Cactii for performance monitoring</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:33:40] &lt;MTecknology&gt; I was originally looking at landscape and was thrown off by the huge price tag; zenoss and nagios look like the only real alternatives</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:33:51] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Zenoss does both, plus a lot more</p><p><span>[03-May-2010 20:34:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I gotta run, check this tomorrow: </span><a class="jive-link-blog-small" href="blogs/zenossblog/2010/05/03/getting-started-with-zenoss-core-webinar-may-4">blogs/zenossblog/2010/05/03/getting-started-with-zenoss-core-webinar-may-4</a></p><p>[03-May-2010 20:34:19] &lt;MTecknology&gt; probably a stretch, does it do any system management?</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:34:30] &lt;MTecknology&gt; ok- thanks</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:35:39] &lt;etank&gt; MTecknology: what kind of system management do you have in mind</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:36:52] &lt;MTecknology&gt; etank: landscape lets you do about everything you could want on an ubuntu system (ubuntu specific) - it's like a gui way to kill a task, install updates, install a new package, reboot a cluster of servers, etc.</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:37:03] &lt;etank&gt; aah</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:37:18] &lt;MTecknology&gt; etank: for the most part - I care very little- I'm just learning and asking</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:37:22] &lt;etank&gt; so kind of like spacewalk or rhn for centos / red hat systems</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:38:09] &lt;etank&gt; if you were meaning reacting to events and performing system tasks then zenoss can do that</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:38:15] &lt;MTecknology&gt; ya, I think so</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:38:30] &lt;MTecknology&gt; the spacewalk part</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:38:46] &lt;etank&gt; i.e. we have a system that we are monitoring. if a certain service stops that we care about zenoss restarts it for us</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:38:57] &lt;MTecknology&gt; cool</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:39:18] &lt;etank&gt; we just have a shell script that it uses to remote to the box and start it back up</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:39:28] &lt;etank&gt; it happens almost as soon as it goes down</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:39:54] &lt;MTecknology&gt; once the healthcheck runs?</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:39:58] &lt;MTecknology&gt; or something like that</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:40:01] &lt;etank&gt; as far as updates and stuff though i dont think it could push then</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:40:15] &lt;etank&gt; yeah. once every 5 minutes it does an snmp walk.</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:40:22] &lt;etank&gt; or maybe that is once a minute</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:40:29] &lt;MTecknology&gt; landscape is 5min</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:40:45] &lt;etank&gt; either way. as soon as it sees the stopped daemon it restarts it for us</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:40:53] &lt;MTecknology&gt; nice</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:41:21] &lt;MTecknology&gt; what's different with ose?</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:41:25] &lt;etank&gt; for patches and stuff i dont see it doing it</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:41:35] &lt;etank&gt; support basically</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:41:44] &lt;etank&gt; you dont get the enterprise zenpacks</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:41:45] &lt;MTecknology&gt; nice</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:41:55] &lt;etank&gt; but there are a ton of nice community packs available</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:42:20] &lt;MTecknology&gt; so.. get an extra server and install the daemon on each client?</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:42:31] &lt;etank&gt; no daemons</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:42:34] &lt;etank&gt; all snmp</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:42:37] &lt;etank&gt; or ssh</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:42:43] &lt;etank&gt; wmi for windows</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:42:49] &lt;MTecknology&gt; cool</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:43:11] &lt;MTecknology&gt; I'm going to have to try this out :D</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:43:13] &lt;MTecknology&gt; thanks :D</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:43:19] &lt;MTecknology&gt; gotta run - bbiab</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:43:28] &lt;etank&gt; the best way to see what it can do is join up for the seminar that matt talked about</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:43:36] &lt;etank&gt; or dl it and give it a go</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:54:49] &lt;MTecknology&gt; etank: sorry, something pretty urgent came up</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:55:33] &lt;MTecknology&gt; etank: I looked at the tco for landscape and that's in the neighborhood of $4k/yr :P</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:57:34] &lt;MTecknology&gt; etank: so every 5min the system, goes out, checks a system for healthstatus and various other info, then if something happens it can trigger on that?</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:58:02] &lt;MTecknology&gt; and it keeps pretty reports of the system mem/hd/cpu usage and uptime?</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:58:31] &lt;etank&gt; yeah pretty much</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:58:42] &lt;etank&gt; you can adjust it to make it check more often</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:58:52] &lt;etank&gt; and even set escalation on events</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:58:56] &lt;MTecknology&gt; 5min sounds pretty good</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:58:58] &lt;MTecknology&gt; hm?</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:59:02] &lt;etank&gt; and it does deduplication</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:59:29] &lt;etank&gt; so if an event comes in you get one email instead of once per each time the same event is seen</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:59:45] &lt;MTecknology&gt; nice</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:59:45] &lt;etank&gt; which is nice</p><p>[03-May-2010 20:59:48] &lt;MTecknology&gt; what's set escalation?</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:00:17] &lt;etank&gt; for instance. if an event comes in it sets a dedupe id and you get an email</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:00:33] &lt;etank&gt; when the event happens again it incriments the count on the event by 1</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:00:49] &lt;etank&gt; at first the event is set to a Warning</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:01:09] &lt;MTecknology&gt; so when you get around to looking at it, you see the count instead of a lot of the same errors?</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:01:17] &lt;etank&gt; you can set a rule that says if the count reaches a certain level then the event gets bumped to an Error</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:01:22] &lt;etank&gt; yes</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:01:26] &lt;MTecknology&gt; cool</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:01:37] &lt;etank&gt; keeps the email count down</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:02:00] &lt;etank&gt; and you can tell it to only alert after a certain time window</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:02:10] &lt;etank&gt; that keeps flapping reports to a minimum too</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:02:22] &lt;MTecknology&gt; can you tell it to send an arbitrary command to the server? when it runs?</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:02:52] &lt;MTecknology&gt; s/r?/r/</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:02:58] &lt;etank&gt; yeah you should be able to create a template and have it do that</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:03:35] &lt;etank&gt; and then you can set a timing on that template so that it happens every 5 mintues 20 mintues what ever</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:03:56] &lt;MTecknology&gt; so, aptitude update &amp;&amp; yes y | aptitude full-upgrade ? :P</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:04:09] &lt;MTecknology&gt; I don't think I'd actually want to do it.. but..</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:04:21] &lt;etank&gt; yeah i wouldnt want to do that</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:04:51] &lt;etank&gt; you may be able to get an update count (like what byobu reports) and graph the numbers</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:05:05] &lt;etank&gt; if the graph is up then you have updates to apply</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:05:15] &lt;etank&gt; but you wouldnt know what they were really</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:05:39] &lt;MTecknology&gt; that's plenty of info for me</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:06:12] &lt;etank&gt; hope it helped some</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:06:13] &lt;MTecknology&gt; how secure is snmp?</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:06:27] &lt;etank&gt; snmp v3 can be encrypted</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:06:35] &lt;MTecknology&gt; I meant just seeing update count is plenty</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:06:42] &lt;etank&gt; but there was a bug in zenoss with snmp3 with the last release</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:06:56] &lt;MTecknology&gt; personally, I'd probably run it over ssh, just comfort :P</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:07:04] &lt;MTecknology&gt; I never dealt with snmp</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:07:06] &lt;etank&gt; and with snmp you can tell it to only talk to certain systems</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:08:02] &lt;MTecknology&gt; you mean like a group of systems?</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:08:07] &lt;etank&gt; i think that with ssh you would need to copy some zenoss scripts to the machine being monitored</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:08:21] &lt;etank&gt; so that zenoss has something to run on that box</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:08:44] &lt;etank&gt; well you can tell a snmp client to only allow a certain IP to make calls against it</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:09:17] &lt;etank&gt; and you set a community string that is not common</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:09:23] &lt;MTecknology&gt; oh</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:09:25] &lt;etank&gt; public is the common string name</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:09:34] &lt;etank&gt; we use something at work that is specific to our team</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:10:04] &lt;MTecknology&gt; is it like a password kinda thing?</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:10:15] &lt;etank&gt; kinda</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:10:29] &lt;MTecknology&gt; Then would something like 'kXD6B8sZpXQ5bWHQ5O8vLneCGaPCvPucdMSN38WC5pi0' work? :P</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:10:42] &lt;etank&gt; but you would prolly use the same string on every client</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:10:51] &lt;etank&gt; that make the roll out easier</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:11:09] &lt;MTecknology&gt; I use ufw for managing access usually</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:11:27] &lt;etank&gt; aah. just make sure you open port 161 for snmp then</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:11:36] &lt;MTecknology&gt; in addition to firewall rules - usually duplicate entries</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:11:38] &lt;etank&gt; udp 161 i think is the right port at least</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:12:28] &lt;MTecknology&gt; so install snmp on clients, setup string, setup access rules, configure zenoss, and bliss?</p><p><span>[03-May-2010 21:12:52] &lt;etank&gt;

i need a good integrated client (twitter, identi.ca, facebook)</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:28:20] &lt;MTecknology&gt; i like it, except for their jabber users disappearing</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:28:28] &lt;MTecknology&gt; I just use bitlbee</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:30:11] &lt;MTecknology&gt; well... the #1 thing I care about is what the system offers; #2 is the community</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:30:18] &lt;MTecknology&gt; #3 is the price poitn</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:30:38] &lt;MTecknology&gt; so far, I don't see any reason this doesn't hit every one of those marks.</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:31:49] &lt;MTecknology&gt; looks very active too</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:32:06] &lt;MTecknology&gt; etank: btw - you were extremely helpful - thanks :D</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:32:23] &lt;etank&gt; MTecknology: any time</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:32:56] &lt;etank&gt; if the need is there too the enterprise product is very fairly priced</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:33:11] &lt;etank&gt; lots of helpful people in here too</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:33:20] &lt;MTecknology&gt; I'm looking at the cost of that</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:33:57] &lt;etank&gt; im sure it is different for every company but i think we got a very fair deal</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:34:05] &lt;etank&gt; if it is something that you need</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:34:50] &lt;MTecknology&gt; what would i expect for say 25 nodes?</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:35:17] &lt;MTecknology&gt; here we go</p><p><span>[03-May-2010 21:35:18] &lt;MTecknology&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.zenoss.com/product/pricing">http://www.zenoss.com/product/pricing</a></p><p>[03-May-2010 21:36:12] &lt;MTecknology&gt; that confuses me - the Min # resources?</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:36:21] &lt;etank&gt; hmm. i think there is a minimum</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:36:48] &lt;etank&gt; the min was lower in the past</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:36:55] &lt;etank&gt; i think we got it at 150 nodes</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:37:00] &lt;MTecknology&gt; does it mean you need to have at least 250 resources that you're paying for and you pay $100 each?</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:37:06] &lt;etank&gt; yeah</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:37:19] &lt;MTecknology&gt; so $25,000 min per year</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:37:36] &lt;etank&gt; sounds about right</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:37:50] &lt;MTecknology&gt; pricey</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:37:58] &lt;etank&gt; that is actually pretty cheap compaired to the competition</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:38:12] &lt;etank&gt; if you have 25 nodes then i would go with the community edition</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:38:34] &lt;MTecknology&gt; landscape is $150/node/year - but then there's no foss option</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:39:06] &lt;MTecknology&gt; the foss version sounds excellent though</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:40:57] &lt;MTecknology&gt; and when you get to that point the cost seems pretty low</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:41:14] &lt;MTecknology&gt; i guess the issue is getting to the point where you can justify that cost</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:42:38] &lt;MTecknology&gt; i mean if you're going to go that route - i likely will at some point.</p><p>[03-May-2010 21:44:20] &lt;MTecknology&gt; etank: now.......

ok, thanks for the help</p><p>[10-May-2010 14:11:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</p><p>[10-May-2010 14:13:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, so far zero people here are happy with the new event console</p><p>[10-May-2010 14:13:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; :(</p><p>[10-May-2010 14:14:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; due to performance issues</p><p>[10-May-2010 14:16:36] &lt;jeffi&gt; thats right, since 've upgrade zenoss from 2.4 to 2.5 branch, this feature just stop of working</p><p>[10-May-2010 14:17:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've noticed that scrolling through events is much better with it, but loading or moving events to history is horribly slow</p><p>[10-May-2010 14:19:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; hopefully it'll be improved in stone crab</p><p>[10-May-2010 14:55:54] &lt;zykes-&gt; question, does zenoss support autodiscovery outside of snmp ?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:04:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; zykes-: yes</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:04:58] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; zykes-: discovery is based on the /Discover device class, which attempts to use SNMP, WMI and SSH</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:05:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you could add additional modeling plugins to discover devices</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:08:17] &lt;Simon4&gt; mrayzenoss: do you know of any guides to removing devices programatically?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:08:41] &lt;Simon4&gt; (and, Hi!)</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:08:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: why wouldn't you just call on the function to remove a device?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:08:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; Simon4: no, but that shouldn't be too hard</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:09:10] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: I've been using device.deleteDevice()</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:09:16] &lt;Simon4&gt; but it seems to leave the catalogue in a mess :/</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:09:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:09:26] &lt;Simon4&gt; so hoping there's some better way that i just haven't seen</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:09:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; why don't you figure out which Zenoss python file is responsible for removing devices and check what it does?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:11:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, that was where I started today.. it just seems to call _delObject(id)</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:11:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I'm sure it does a bit more than that</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:11:29] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

that's the literal function you want</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:12:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; deleteDevice()</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:12:21] &lt;Simon4&gt; but after removing the device, if you navigate to say... Collectors/localhost</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:12:35] &lt;Simon4&gt; you get a stacktrace saying there's a keyerror for the device you just hoovered</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:12:50] &lt;Simon4&gt; so there are remnants still somewhere</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:13:04] &lt;Simon4&gt; same if you go to an ipservice that the host had defined, etc</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:13:12] &lt;Simon4&gt; it's like not all the relations are cleaned up</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:13:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; Then there may be some other function that it's calling before or after</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:13:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to find the code to remove a device from the GUI</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:13:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; and check example what it's calling on</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:14:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; example == exactly</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:15:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh hold up</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:15:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; after you delete the device, are you doing a reindex()?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:15:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; if not, that's your problem</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:16:15] &lt;rmatte&gt;

so you need to remove the device, commit, reindex, and commit again</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:16:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; try it and let us know if it works</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:17:42] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: ahhh</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:17:47] * Simon4 tries with the reindex</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:29:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: I assume that the dev guys are aware that the public demo of stone crab doesn't work at all in IE?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:29:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; IE 8 to be specific (even if I use compatibility mode)</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:29:53] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm sure</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:29:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:30:03] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; QA is testing on IE7 and 8</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:30:14] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; 3.0 is supposed to be IE8 compatible</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:30:20] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I'm sure it's something transient</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:30:53] &lt;zykes-&gt; mrayzenoss: any user needed to use wmi on hosts ?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:31:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, you need an account that has access to poll WMI</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:31:17] &lt;zykes-&gt; where do i set that ?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:31:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; easiest way, make the user an admin</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:31:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; then that username and password needs to be set in zWinUser and zWinPassword under zProperties in Zenoss</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:32:01] &lt;zykes-&gt; ah</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:32:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's a section in the Zenoss Admin guide that explains all of this</p><p><span>[10-May-2010 15:32:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; </span><a class="jive-link-wiki-small" href="DOC-3745.html">docs/DOC-3745</a><span> is a nice wiki article for XP</span></p><p>[10-May-2010 15:33:49] &lt;zykes-&gt;

that sucks...</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:46:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can add product models perfectly fine, but anything to do with software can't be added</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:47:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:49:15] &lt;rmatte&gt;

see at the bottom where there's a "show all" button?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:49:55] &lt;zykes-&gt; i can add one, but it doesn't show in the overview.</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:49:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; (the bug that I was thinking of is something else)</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:50:05] &lt;zykes-&gt;

make sure that the product has the proper OID in it when you create it</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:50:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; then remodel the device</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:50:51] &lt;zykes-&gt; oid ?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:50:56] &lt;rmatte&gt;

rmatte: does that work on windows ?</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:51:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, I guarantee it does</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:52:02] &lt;zykes-&gt; hmm, k</p><p>[10-May-2010 15:53:11] &lt;rmatte&gt;

zeopack asks for a port, I take it that means the Data.fs must be in use by the service</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:21:21] &lt;LarsN&gt; themactech: the Data.fs is just a zope thing.&#160; There's no reason I can think of that it would require the entire zenoss installation.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:22:08] &lt;LarsN&gt; themactech: doing a quick search on offline packing.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:22:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; themactech: you'll need to make sure all your ZenPacks are installed too</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:22:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; before bringing over your Data.fs</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:22:38] &lt;themactech&gt; I will try tonight to copy this 88GB file over the internet (the zenoss server is in another state), VPN timeout issues have hampered this but I just figured out a workaround, might take 16 hours to copy this but then I will be able to kick it around much easier</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:22:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;

themactech: I'd recommend making sure you have a backup of the Data.fs before trying this....&#160; but: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.offlinepack/0.2">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.offlinepack/0.2</a></p><p>[13-May-2010 10:24:27] &lt;LarsN&gt; scratch that, that's for zope3</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:24:45] &lt;LarsN&gt; there's a similar zope2 package, I'm just not finding it.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:25:04] &lt;themactech&gt; I will look into it, might be a good utility to keep installed on my zenoss boxes</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:25:19] &lt;themactech&gt; somewhat miffed that my zenoss DB blew up to 88GB and fubared my ubuntu</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:25:48] &lt;themactech&gt; worst thing is&#160; i was schedule to clone the entire this last week, but that got put off by a week due to an urgent project</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:26:07] &lt;LarsN&gt; if it makes you feel any better, I had a customer try to insert ~ 65,000 records into a plone site (zope backed) then, when he realized that wasn't going to work, he programatically went to remove the 36k or so that he previously installed.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:26:25] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; @Simon4 You can remove the packable relationship from the zeodb for the templates, .pack.remove()</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:26:38] &lt;LarsN&gt; the Data.fs grew to 127gb in under a day, filled /var and broke things good.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:27:25] &lt;LarsN&gt; usually to pack a Data.fs you need 2x the mount of disk space.&#160; ie, a 100gb Data.fs will require 200gb of space since it packs it, and creates a Data.fs.old that's otherwise untouched.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:27:34] &lt;LarsN&gt; s/mount/amount</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:27:55] &lt;themactech&gt; I will initiate this large copy tonight, then I will try to add the missing zenpacks to my secondary install and try again simlinking the original Data.fs into the new install to see if it loads up.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:28:25] &lt;themactech&gt; space will not be an issue when I get the file off this server</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:28:35] &lt;LarsN&gt; themactech: my sr. sysadmin is telling me the z3c.offlinepack should work on Zope2 databases.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:28:45] &lt;zykes-&gt; anyone tried using fortigate on zenoss ?</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:28:49] &lt;themactech&gt; cool, i will give it a shot</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:28:55] &lt;zykes-&gt; i tried the zenpack but it fucks it up</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:29:43] &lt;themactech&gt; BTW I build all my Zenoss servers on Dell poweredge servers with DRAC interfaces, the DRAC interface saved me a trip to new york on this failure, was able to do a bare metal restore remotely with it</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:29:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; zykes-: 1.0 or 1.1?</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:30:33] &lt;zykes-&gt; 1.1 i think</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:30:38] &lt;LarsN&gt; themactech: we use console redirection and some of 1995's greatest technology....&#160; the 48port Xyplex terminal server :)</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:30:45] &lt;LarsN&gt; times three</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:31:10] &lt;LarsN&gt; how well do those DRAC cards work?</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:32:01] &lt;themactech&gt; The DRAC has that, plus you can mount virtual media, I put a systemrescueCD in my MacBook Pro (booted into windows, the DRAC is not very mac friendly), told the DRAC to make the server believe this CD was in the drive and booted my Dell in New York off the rescueCD in my laptop</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:32:53] &lt;themactech&gt; The console redirection gives you complete KVM access, you can even get into bios settings at boot</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:33:28] &lt;LarsN&gt; we regularly PXE boot to install OSs remotely.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:33:39] &lt;themactech&gt; we do the same on XServes</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:33:43] &lt;LarsN&gt; PXE + Console redirection works pretty well in our 98% FreeBSD shop.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:34:03] &lt;themactech&gt; we setup a netboot server and tell the down server via IPMI to boot off of it</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:34:55] &lt;LarsN&gt; nod.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:35:14] &lt;themactech&gt; We argue with vendors all the time to include IPMI in their server builds</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:35:56] &lt;themactech&gt; Digital rapids doesn't have it, Harris doesn't have it, so we build their services on Dell boxes so we can do remote service</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:37:25] &lt;themactech&gt; I am trying the new 3.0 alpha and I can't figure out how to add a network, the new interface has things more condensed but I find it less intuitive.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:37:53] &lt;themactech&gt; I'm in the network pane, and there is no 'add' button, just a lot of fields and a save button</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:38:02] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; button at the bottom left</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:38:30] &lt;themactech&gt; Oh I assume I only had to fill in the fields and save, but that gives me a pop up error</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:38:42] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; It's a "+" below the network listing tree</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:38:53] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; yeah, that page is still in progress</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:39:49] &lt;themactech&gt; added my network and doing discovery now, the new interface will need getting used to, no big deal</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:43:18] &lt;Simon4&gt; mtzenoss: sorry for delayed response - thanks heaps I'll give that a go :)</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:43:38] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; np</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:44:10] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; if anyone is checking out the Alpha #4, our QA team is in #zenoss-testing if you have questions/comments</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:46:00] &lt;themactech&gt; I am still looking for a way to add new fields to the database, I want to add fields with the same class/behavior than the 'comments' field.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:46:11] &lt;themactech&gt; does mtzenoss know how I can do this?</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:49:21] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; What item are you trying to add new fields to?</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:50:15] &lt;LarsN&gt; mrayzenoss: I will hopefully be building an alpha 4 test server tonight at home.</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:50:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; LarsN: cool</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:50:38] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; we may be entering beta in about 2 weeks</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:50:42] &lt;themactech&gt; I am running alpha 4 on ubuntu 10.04 on a VirtualBox image</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:50:57] &lt;LarsN&gt; I'll be deploying to FreeBSD 8.0-release-p2</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:51:11] &lt;themactech&gt; I want to have a few more fields that can hold customized data in the Status tab</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:51:32] &lt;themactech&gt; I have gear where we need to track firmware info, some other gear needs us to track the licensing of the box</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:52:11] &lt;themactech&gt; I have figured how to customize the field headers on the status page per device class, I just need a few fields that can hold the custom info I want to display</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:52:42] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; Are you talking about the Event console?</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:52:48] &lt;themactech&gt; I need those to be accessible from a modeler plugin, that is why I use the 'comments' field as a template since that field does everything I need, just need to clone that field a few times</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:53:12] &lt;themactech&gt; no, the device status page</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:53:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; themactech: I believe you'll have to extend the model to get that</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:53:22] &lt;themactech&gt; I agree</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:54:08] &lt;themactech&gt; I was given examples that do this in Zenpacks and will extend model for only a device class, I will need this further down the road, but now I want to extend the DB with these few fields so that it applies to all devices</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:54:25] &lt;themactech&gt; I want a Custom1 and Custom2 field that all device classes can push data into</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:54:37] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; oh, the device page, let me check</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:54:42] &lt;themactech&gt; I will then customize the header for these fields per device class</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:54:56] &lt;themactech&gt; I have already posted on how to do the field header customization in the forums</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:55:08] &lt;themactech&gt; all i need now is to add the fields that will hold the data</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:55:42] &lt;themactech&gt; this process would make it very easy for anyone to customize the device status page for any device class they create</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:57:30] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; @themactech add to the _properties of the Device model</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:58:10] &lt;themactech&gt; I know how to add zproperties and custom schemas, but I was told these cannot be pushed data to from a modeler</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:58:23] &lt;themactech&gt; And my testing seems to confirm that info</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:58:27] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; From a ZenPack you can just do Device._properties += {}</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:58:36] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; hm</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:58:47] &lt;themactech&gt; again its why i mention the 'comments' field, it has all the behavior I am looking for</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:59:22] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; comments is just a regular property</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:59:23] &lt;themactech&gt; The only things I can do with ZenPacks right now are from the GUI</p><p>[13-May-2010 10:59:44] &lt;themactech&gt; alright can you give me a walkthrough on how to make a 'comments' clone?</p><p>[13-May-2010 11:00:07] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; Let me see if there's a way to do it from the UI</p><p>[13-May-2010 11:00:36] &lt;themactech&gt; that would be preferable but if not, give me the hard liquor, I have to figure this out</p><p>[13-May-2010 11:03:00] joseph is now known as Guest23093</p><p>[13-May-2010 11:08:22] &lt;mtzenoss&gt;

I need the behavior of the comments field, but the only thing I can add easily is a zproperty</p><p>[13-May-2010 11:33:58] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; In zenmodeler you don't have a direct connection to the ZODB, so you don't have access to a real-live Zope object -- just a shadow</p><p>[13-May-2010 11:34:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; looks like the comments is defined in Device.py</p><p>[13-May-2010 11:34:43] &lt;mtzenoss&gt; The data that fills out the 'device' object is whatever gets pumped out from a zenhub service.</p><p>[13-May-2010 11:34:47] &lt;mtzenoss&gt;

everyone knows "public"</p><p>[14-May-2010 15:32:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if you leave it at that and someone gets on to your network they can find out anything about any of your devices</p><p>[14-May-2010 15:32:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; so change it to something else</p><p>[14-May-2010 15:33:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless you don't care about security, then just set it to public :P</p><p>[14-May-2010 15:40:26] &lt;Rolfs&gt; any reason why zenoss doesn't include processmonitoring over SSH ?</p><p>[14-May-2010 15:41:02] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Zenoss doesn't alert me. I find that strange.</p><p>[17-May-2010 16:59:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; LarsN: but honestly, that method that's on that page works just as well</p><p>[17-May-2010 16:59:57] &lt;LarsN&gt; rmatte: I'll continue to follow the above path, and if we find it lacking I guess maybe we'll roll our own.&#160;

yeh, customize it however you need to</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:00:31] &lt;LarsN&gt; rgr.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:00:40] &lt;LarsN&gt; danke.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:00:52] &lt;LarsN&gt; (that's roger, for the non ham types :) )</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:01:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, the transform already does that</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:01:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; evt.severity = 5</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:01:12] &lt;QubeZ&gt; I have a server that sometimes loses the NFS mount and so I have that to monitor and run a ssh script to remount the share.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:01:32] &lt;LarsN&gt; I must be doing something wrong then.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:02:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; why's that?</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:02:11] &lt;LarsN&gt; I get an "info" alert saying it can't read /mnt/path&#160; and randomly the NFS mount just vanishes from the OS tab if it wasn't mounted for "some" amount of time.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:02:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, my transform automatically locks the mount so that it can't vanish</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:02:36] &lt;LarsN&gt; if it's mounted up, everything's fine.&#160; It sees the mount in the OS tab, although it incorrectly reports the size.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:02:49] &lt;LarsN&gt; df -h shows 3.6T&#160; the os tab shows 1.6T</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:02:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I'm not sure if you have a problem with the spacing of the transform or something</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:03:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; If it's showing incorrect info, remodel</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:03:13] &lt;LarsN&gt; that's possible.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:03:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; though SNMP may have some limit on hard drive sizes, not sure</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:03:42] &lt;LarsN&gt; that's also possible.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:04:03] * LarsN is running ancient net-snmp.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:04:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; net-snmp is pretty good</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:04:29] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you sure that info event that you're seeing isn't a debug event?</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:05:58] &lt;LarsN&gt; it is a debug event.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:06:01] &lt;LarsN&gt; the problem is</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:06:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, then you haven't applied my transform properly</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:06:15] &lt;LarsN&gt; for the last hour, the mount has been detached, and zenoss never triggered an event :)</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:06:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, make sure the OID in the debug event matches the OID in the transform</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:06:25] &lt;LarsN&gt; i knew I must have been doing something wrong.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:06:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hadn't tested with FreeBSD</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:06:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's possible that it's slightly different and needs to be changed in the transform</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:06:41] &lt;LarsN&gt;

in place of the one provided on the link above.</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:08:43] &lt;LarsN&gt; adjustments made.&#160; Now I get to give Zenoss it's important time to think about what it's done :)</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:09:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; well hold up</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:09:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think I only had a partial OID in the transform</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:09:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is how it should be</p><p>[17-May-2010 17:09:49] &lt;LarsN&gt;

I tried to create the same thershold "/FileSystem&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; /high disk usage" as in the "Server" class but I get the following error: zenhub|User-supplied Python expression (here.getTotalBlocks() * .85) for maximum value caused error: ['usedBlocks_usedBlocks'] The threshold high disk usage in template /zport/dmd/Devices/VPNs/rrdTemplates/FileSystem has been disabled.</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:24:12] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; What I'm doing wrong?</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:31:38] &lt;LarsN&gt; how frequently does Zenoss remodel devices automatically, if at all?</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:32:02] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; 270 minutes as far as I remember</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:32:32] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; you can force remodeling of a particular device if needed of adjust modeling cycle time</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:33:02] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; LarsN: do you need steps for above actions?</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:35:28] &lt;LarsN&gt; manual modling I'm familiar with</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:35:44] &lt;LarsN&gt; I just wanted to make sure, as we make changes to the server's NFS mount points that eventually they'll get picked up</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:35:47] &lt;LarsN&gt; :)</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:35:50] &lt;LarsN&gt; thanks.</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:35:54] &lt;LarsN&gt; every 4 hours or so is acceptable.</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:36:19] &lt;LarsN&gt; I'm manually updating 12 servers, that aren't quite right yet, but getting them close none the less.</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:36:34] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; :)</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:37:19] &lt;LarsN&gt; told my boss once I'm done with this bit.&#160; I'm drinking a six pack</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:37:21] &lt;LarsN&gt; and going to bed.</p><p>[17-May-2010 19:37:23] &lt;LarsN&gt; :)</p><p>[17-May-2010 20:01:04] LarsN is now known as LarsN_Away</p><p>[18-May-2010 00:00:30] [disconnected at Tue May 18 00:00:30 2010]</p><p>[18-May-2010 00:00:31] [connected at Tue May 18 00:00:31 2010]</p><p>[18-May-2010 00:00:43] [zenoss-logger (logger bot) has joined #zenoss]</p><p>[18-May-2010 02:25:15] Simon4_ is now known as Simon4</p><p>[18-May-2010 09:59:53] &lt;cgibbons&gt; creepily quiet today</p><p>[18-May-2010 10:07:16] &lt;fragfutter&gt; i could ask some questions about hp-eva ...</p><p>[18-May-2010 10:07:30] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; fragfutter: bigegor logs on frequently</p><p>[18-May-2010 10:07:46] &lt;fragfutter&gt; but lives in a different timezone like the rest of the channel ;)</p><p>[18-May-2010 10:09:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; apparently he's a nightowl, he was here yesterday at 5pm my time, which I assume was around midnight</p><p>[18-May-2010 10:21:29] &lt;fragfutter&gt; looks like his zenpack can't handle my eva. and after a day with HP-SIM i can't wrap my head around zenoss again.</p><p>[18-May-2010 10:25:33] &lt;fragfutter&gt; SIM, CIM, SMI-S, WBEM, wcproxy, cve.

which takes care of your overlap issue</p><p>[19-May-2010 13:18:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; since the server knows that when sending to this IP range, direct the data out whichever tunnel corresponds to that range, then translate it to/from the actual range for that site</p><p>[19-May-2010 13:19:08] &lt;rmatte&gt;

give me a few minutes...</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:44:33] &lt;rayk3n&gt; alriight</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:47:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; now...</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:47:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you ok with setting the threshold as a percentage of utilization?</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:48:00] &lt;rayk3n&gt; hmm</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:48:05] &lt;rayk3n&gt; let me try</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:48:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; well hold up</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:48:19] &lt;rayk3n&gt; can i use that on a specific device only?</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:48:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; no</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:48:39] &lt;rayk3n&gt; i guess i can't use that</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:48:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, let me explain something...</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:48:47] &lt;rayk3n&gt; sure</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:48:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; memAvailReal only gives you the amount of available memory on the device</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:48:53] &lt;rayk3n&gt; btw thanks for the time</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:48:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is basically useless unless you also know the total</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:49:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; now the total is stored in here.hw.totalMemory</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:49:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; so we need to use the two to set a proper threshold</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:50:19] &lt;rayk3n&gt; hmm i think i do not have totalMemory in my template</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:50:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; the problem is, if we had something that provided used instead of available it would be much more helpful</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:50:27] &lt;rayk3n&gt; i just use the default linux device</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:50:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, the default linux device doesn't have any properly built thresholds</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:50:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; hence why you need to develop them yourself</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:51:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; either that or just hardcode the amount of bytes in to a threshold</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:51:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that's not very dynamic</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:51:45] &lt;rayk3n&gt; ic</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:52:13] &lt;rayk3n&gt; can i just use a min or max value? on the memAvailReal</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:52:20] &lt;rayk3n&gt; then add a warning or critical alert</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:52:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll have to be in bytes if you do</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:52:35] &lt;rayk3n&gt; its fine by me</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:52:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not smart enough to know it's a percentage unless you actually provide an equation that works out to be a percentage</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:52:51] &lt;rayk3n&gt; just need to know what bytes like example. 1392492</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:53:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, well then just specify the proper number of bytes of available memory for when 5GB is in use</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:53:04] &lt;rayk3n&gt; if it goes 700000 or lower</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:53:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; and apply the threshold against memAvailReal</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:53:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll need more than 700000 lol</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:53:38] &lt;fragfutter&gt; memTotalReal-memAvailReal-memBuffer= memused</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:53:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; 1024000000 is 1GB</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:53:57] &lt;rayk3n&gt; yes that's what i need to know</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:54:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; fragfutter: there is no memtotalreal, he'd have to add that</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:55:00] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: can't you add this as a datasource?</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:55:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; fragfutter: of course</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:55:22] &lt;fragfutter&gt; fairly static, but should work.</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:55:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, you could make it non-static</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:56:10] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: sure. i ment it would poll the same value most of the times.</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:56:25] &lt;rayk3n&gt; so if i want to send alert if a 13G memory uses 5G so that's 7G ill just input 1024000000(x7) in the min ?</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:57:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; rayk3n: for a rough way of doing it, correct</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:58:10] &lt;rayk3n&gt; hmm weird i just added 14000000 on the min. and it gives me alert</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:59:01] &lt;fragfutter&gt; can i have a threshold on a calculated value?</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:59:07] &lt;rayk3n&gt; i mean 140000000</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:59:22] &lt;rayk3n&gt; and my current memory is 1392492</p><p>[20-May-2010 10:59:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; fragfutter: what do you mean?</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:00:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; rayk3n: you're doing something wrong, the threshold is set against memAvailReal, yes?</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:00:25] &lt;rayk3n&gt; yes</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:00:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; snmpwalk that OID to see what the current value is</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:00:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you'll understand why it's not working</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:01:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; using the "free" command isn't going to cut it</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:01:09] &lt;rayk3n&gt; &lt;rayk3n&gt; UCD-SNMP-MIB::memAvailReal.0 = INTEGER: 13924928 kB</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:01:09] &lt;rayk3n&gt; &lt;rayk3n&gt; DONE in 0 seconds</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:01:34] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: if i define a threshold, it is defined against a datapoint, which represents a single oid. If i could send a threshold against something like pointA+pointB</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:01:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so you set the min to 140000000 and it's actually 13924928</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:02:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; you have an extra 0 that shouldn't be there apparently</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:02:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:02:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; add -On as a flag to the snmpwalk</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:02:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; pretty sure that's the problem though</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:03:22] &lt;twm1010&gt; rmatte:&#160; do you pull any perf data from ds1 and ds3 controllers?</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:03:40] &lt;twm1010&gt; i have blank templates right now, so they don't use ethernetCSmacd, but surely there are metrics to be watches there</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:03:44] &lt;twm1010&gt; *watched</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:03:44] &lt;rayk3n&gt; hmm where can i find that</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:04:15] &lt;fragfutter&gt; the trailing zero is fine for a netsnmp server</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:05:42] &lt;rayk3n&gt; rmatte i think 14000000 is the value im looking for</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:07:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; looks like</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:07:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I guess they cut it down to KB instead of bytes, my bad</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:08:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; snmpwalk is your friend when troubleshooting stuff like that</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:08:20] &lt;rayk3n&gt; ic thanks</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:09:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; np</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:12:56] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: any idea about a threshold against a calculated value?</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:13:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; define: calculated value</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:13:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can do basically anything with thresholds, just be more specific :)</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:17:35] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: i have two data source. Both are SNMp values.</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:17:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:18:00] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: no i want to have a threshold, that complaiins if data_source1+data_source2 &gt; 100</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:18:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see...</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:19:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm trying to think of the best way to do that...</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:20:26] &lt;fragfutter&gt; can i add a data source that calculates its value from the two other datasources?</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:21:20] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; fragfutter: kinda</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:21:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can do that with a threshold or a graph point</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:21:42] &lt;fragfutter&gt; i'm listening</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:21:46] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm looking :)</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:22:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know how to do it with a graphpoint, but that doesn't help him with his threshold</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:23:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; I know how to do calculations on the min and max values themselves</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:23:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; but he wants to apply the threshold against the sum of 2 datasources</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:23:51] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: exactly</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:24:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; There's a way to do it, I just don't know off the top of my head...</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:25:55] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hmm&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; it seems like you should be able to put the data points in the min/max value fields</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:29:09] &lt;fragfutter&gt; mrayzenoss: looking at the source, yes this might work.</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:30:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: you can, but that doesn't work for what he wants to do</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:30:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; the threshold needs to be applied against a value</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:30:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; and that value needs to be data_source1+data_source2</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:31:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; adding them in to the min or max doesn't help</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:31:15] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; hmm&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; yeah</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:31:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's one thing I'd love to see fixed, since I've had to use command datasources for no real good reason just because of that</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:31:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; it works fine the other way around</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:32:19] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, command data sources make it easy</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:32:27] &lt;fragfutter&gt; i could define minmax-threshold against datasource2 a use a min-value of 100-datasource1</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:32:27] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; sounds like a good enhancement ticket</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:32:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, you could</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:32:50] &lt;fragfutter&gt; (max-value that is)</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:33:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you want to use the datasources in min/max that's really easy...</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:33:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; just do...</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:33:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; here.getRRDValue("nameOfDataSource")</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:33:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're using Zenoss 2.5.2 I hope?</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:33:44] &lt;fragfutter&gt; yes</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:33:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, then yeh</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:33:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; just do that and you'll be good</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:34:21] &lt;fragfutter&gt; yeah, but it is a rather strange way to define the threshold.</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:34:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; whatever works</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:34:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:35:34] &lt;fragfutter&gt; define a custom oid on the monitored-server side might be easier on my brain if i look at it in a few months</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:36:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; the method you just described makes sense and would work fine</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:36:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; 100 - here.getRRDValue("datasource1")</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:36:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; as the min</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:36:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, wouldn't you want it set as the max?</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:37:07] &lt;fragfutter&gt; yes max, i corrected myself.</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:37:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, k</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:38:02] &lt;fragfutter&gt; i think i will file an enhancement request for a threshold that allows a python snippet.</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:38:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; that would be cool</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:38:30] &lt;fragfutter&gt; would that be possible?</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:38:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; probably</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:38:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; something similar to event handling</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:39:19] &lt;fragfutter&gt; i also have questions about event handling, but i need to leave...</p><p>[20-May-2010 11:39:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk for a few</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:00:11] &lt;mistich&gt; rmatte you update the cisco mibs latley</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:07:35] &lt;rmatte&gt;

The pack is a year old</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:16:39] &lt;mistich&gt; nope</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:16:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I can't see them having done anything overly groundbreaking since then</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:18:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure you follow the zendmd process listed on the ZenPack page after it's done installing</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:18:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; or your UI is going to be very slow</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:18:32] &lt;mistich&gt; why does it make it slow?</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:18:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's some bug in Zenoss</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:18:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; the more ZenPack content installed, the slower the UI gets</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:18:56] &lt;mistich&gt; doesn't surprise me</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:19:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; so by performing those steps, it leaves the Mibs installed but makes Zenoss unaware of the ZenPack</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:19:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; which resolves the issue</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:19:45] &lt;mistich&gt; ok</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:20:05] &lt;mistich&gt; well started zenpack install over well see how it goes</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:20:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, give it a lot of time lol</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:20:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; it will finish</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:20:44] &lt;mistich&gt; I will just miss read and got back from lunch and still running</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:20:55] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I wonder if you could run zenmib 8 times with 1/8'th of the mibs each :)</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:23:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:23:31] &lt;mistich&gt; trust me I have done that with zendisc all the time</p><p>[20-May-2010 12:24:13] &lt;mistich&gt;

hmm I see</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:37:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; Hamzah: Zenoss is really more of a blank slate than a fully ready to go monitoring tool, you'll have to learn how to develop templates</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:37:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's really not hard to do</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:38:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus once you figure it out you'll be able to monitor anything</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:38:33] &lt;Hamzah&gt; I've been meaning to learn how to do that for some time :) I currently only have it monitoring the "default" things</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:39:37] &lt;Hamzah&gt; The administration guide has everything regarding developing templates, right?</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:40:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:40:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; one of the first things I did when I started using Zenoss was to read the admin guide from top to bottom</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:40:19] &lt;Hamzah&gt; ok, I'll go through that and see if I can figure it out :)</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:40:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it was extremely helpful</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:40:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:41:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I prefer it when people read through that first before trying to walk them through it</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:41:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's the whole teach a man to fish type thing :)</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:41:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; After you've read it, if you run in to snags I'll be happy to help</p><p>[20-May-2010 14:43:22] &lt;Hamzah&gt; I've only read through parts of it so far, not top to bottom.

well, I guess it depends on whether the share is unmounted or not</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:35:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; it needs to timeout and unmount before it'll see it</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:36:14] &lt;LarsN&gt; I'm going to have to write a plugin that uses ssh, and looks for the existance of a file in the share I think.</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:36:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only other solution would be to develop a script that actually needs to ssh in to the machine and check the shares</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:36:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:36:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; how did you even manage to get nfs to fail like that?</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:39:30] &lt;LarsN&gt; I'm willing to put money on our amazingly terrible Dell PowerConnect 6548 switches.</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:40:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:40:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only switches anyone should ever buy are Cisco and HP</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:41:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; and maybe Enterasys if you're adventurous</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:41:42] &lt;LarsN&gt;

although I'm not a massive fan of their switches</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:44:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; their netscreens are awesome though</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:44:59] &lt;Simon4&gt; their SRX's are cool</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:45:00] &lt;LarsN&gt;

just a bunch of blade ones</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:46:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; the HP management console is great</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:47:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; their blade switches are a different story</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:47:06] &lt;LarsN&gt; it's idiotic that, on the same network, the switch would assume it needs to operate at layer 3.</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:47:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hate HP blade switches</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:47:19] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: yeah, that's the only HP switch exp I have, so probably explains the hate</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:47:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:47:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; they must have had a different team making their blade switches</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:47:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; because their other switches are rock solid</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:48:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I used to not mind Nortel switches but the company was uber unstable and finally died</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:50:52] &lt;rmatte&gt;

how likely is the 2.5.2 upgrade to "just work" from 2.4.5 (w/patches)</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:52:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the upgrade should go smoothly enough but you might run in to little problems</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:52:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; which I have the solution for most of</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:52:32] &lt;LarsN&gt; does the order I do the upgrade in matter?</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:52:38] &lt;LarsN&gt; ie, master --&gt; collectors</p><p>[21-May-2010 08:52:48] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I used to use gentoo as my desktop OS</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:35:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; and FreeBSD before that</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:35:26] &lt;LarsN&gt; but it's not as simple as Ubuntu's "ubuntu-restricted" package.</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:35:28] &lt;LarsN&gt;

I'd really like it to work.&#160; and every major version gets a little closer.</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:35:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I used FreeBSD as my desktop for like 5 or 6 years</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:36:11] &lt;LarsN&gt;

I was still learning unix at the time though, so it was a good learning experience for me</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:36:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have better knowledge of FreeBSD and Linux than someone who started out on Ubuntu</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:37:13] &lt;LarsN&gt; same.</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:37:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; I didn't find it very slow in desktopland</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:37:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; it was comparable to Linux</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:37:21] &lt;LarsN&gt; I got started with slackware 0.(something)</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:37:28] &lt;LarsN&gt; in 93 iirc.</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:37:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:38:03] &lt;LarsN&gt; moved to FreeBSD for servers when I came to my current employeer, but have dipped my toe in the water numerous times before then.</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:38:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I'm just past year 10 from when I first started messing around with FreeBSD</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:38:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I'm 25, I started when I was 14 or 15</p><p>[21-May-2010 10:38:24] &lt;LarsN&gt;

I dont have it</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:09:19] &lt;coofamani&gt; swap memory usage yes</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:09:23] &lt;coofamani&gt; swapping/paging no</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:13:45] &lt;jb&gt; nah its not</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:13:57] &lt;jb&gt; have you added any additional graphs for generic linux hosts/.</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:13:58] &lt;jb&gt; ?</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:19:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; the default linux template graphs swap</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:19:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; paging is the microsoft term for swap space</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:19:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's irrelevant</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:20:37] &lt;cgibbons&gt; it's not just the microsoft term for it...</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:23:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, either way, it's the term that they wish to use for it whereas linux calls it swap</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:23:34] &lt;coofamani&gt; swap used vs swap rate is what I was referring to</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:23:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I was just making the point that they are the same thing</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:23:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:23:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; swap used is graphed by default but not swap rate</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:24:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; If swap rate is provided by net-snmp then you can easily add it</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:24:53] &lt;coofamani&gt; not sure it would be very valuable. you are either out of ram or your not</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:25:10] &lt;coofamani&gt; if its happening at all, then its probably an issue.</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:25:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:26:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; since Linux is actually intelligent about it's use of swap</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:26:10] &lt;coofamani&gt; heh</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:26:14] &lt;coofamani&gt; sshhh dont tell the msft people</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:26:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; unlike windows which can't tell the difference between physical and swap</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:26:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:26:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; at least windows isn't limited to 3.25GB of RAM anymore</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:27:00] &lt;coofamani&gt; Windows: welcome to 1975</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:27:05] &lt;rmatte&gt;

The rest...not so much</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:29:26] &lt;coofamani&gt; exchange is debatable. it's just the least evil platform in a horribly done service</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:29:54] &lt;coofamani&gt; imagine if google released gmail for local installation. exchange would vanish in year</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:29:58] &lt;jb&gt; i'd say exchange is pretty valuable.. albeit overpriced and overly complex</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:30:01] &lt;coofamani&gt; gmail + calendar</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:30:08] &lt;jb&gt; but gapps is up there too..</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:30:13] &lt;cgibbons&gt; doubt that, google's calendar isnt as good yet</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:30:20] &lt;coofamani&gt; its getting there fast</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:30:38] &lt;jb&gt; the thing about exchange is.. it integrates with -everything- ms</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:30:51] &lt;coofamani&gt; thats their primary directive right there</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:30:53] &lt;jb&gt; which is usually important for a large corporation using AD</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:30:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, and the integration is done so poorly that you don't want to use it</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:30:57] &lt;jb&gt; no its not</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:30:59] &lt;jb&gt; it works.</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:31:02] &lt;coofamani&gt; it works</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:31:10] &lt;coofamani&gt; its the reason so many shops are like 98% MS</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:31:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; clearly you haven't seen the CRM integration</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:31:18] &lt;coofamani&gt; if you stick in there product set its rokken</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:31:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; then again Microsoft CRM is the biggest POS I've ever seen/used</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:31:31] &lt;jb&gt; uhm, considering we operate an exchange environment with 15,000 mailboxes.. i'd say I know if it works or not :)</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:31:41] &lt;coofamani&gt; yeah, but thats a small market compared to AD/exchange/fileserver</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:32:15] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i'd love it if we could ditch our zimbra junk &amp; use exchange :)</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:32:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; meh, mail is mail</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:32:40] &lt;jb&gt; not really :)</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:32:42] &lt;jb&gt; it used ot be</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:32:45] &lt;jb&gt; to be..</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:32:52] &lt;coofamani&gt; we are over a million on it now I think</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:32:55] &lt;jb&gt; exchange is much more than "just mail" though</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:33:13] &lt;jb&gt; large corporations need more than "just mail"</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:33:17] &lt;SEJeff&gt; coofamani, As a pro Linux Admin, I'd have to agree with jb</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:33:28] &lt;SEJeff&gt; And then when you throw in sharepoint, it does everything</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:33:30] &lt;jb&gt; and I am a linux admin too, btw :)</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:33:35] &lt;coofamani&gt; same</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:33:39] &lt;SEJeff&gt; There is still nothing that compares with it or active directory</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:33:44] &lt;jb&gt; but, I understand the need for MS in a corporat eenvironment</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:33:44] &lt;coofamani&gt; agreed</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:33:55] &lt;SEJeff&gt; FreeIPAv2 from redhat will soon be equivalent from a linux pov to AD</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:34:00] &lt;SEJeff&gt;

We have everything tied in to LDAP</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:37:51] &lt;jb&gt; most of our linux/unix stuff isn't user based stuff.. so there are only a few local users (the admins) on each box</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:37:57] &lt;jb&gt; and i can manage those accounts with puppet</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:38:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I also have multiple zenoss servers</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:38:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I need LDAP for auth</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:38:28] &lt;coofamani&gt; their new website is such a huge improvement</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:38:37] &lt;jb&gt; zenoss ldap leaves a lot to be desired :/</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:38:43] &lt;coofamani&gt; heh</p><p>[21-May-2010 11:39:11] &lt;rmatte&gt;

well, I'm up to about 18500 datapoints on one of my installs now</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:09:52] &lt;gwb2351&gt; sometimes I wonder whay my zenperfsnmp is doing... it's at 16,1000 and there's no way I'm using that much SNMP</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:10:40] &lt;gwb2351&gt;

(for the heaviest collector)</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:22:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:22:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I thought maintenance kept monitoring them but didn't alert</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:22:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; guess not</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:23:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, there's a ticket that's been sitting in our stack for over 3 hours and no one has even looked at it</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:23:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt;&#160;

guess not</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:24:12] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I think the options are monitoring, alerting, dashboard</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:24:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; err, not that order</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:24:56] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; you can have monitoring with stuff show up on the dashboard with no alerts</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:25:06] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or just monitoring, no alerts or dashboard</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:28:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:29:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm up to 392 devices on my largest install now</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:29:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; just a few more before I break 400 :)</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:30:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; That particular client has a huge server farm which we'll hopefully eventually be monitoring</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:30:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd have to use collectors for that though since that would bring us over 1000 devices</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:32:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I applied the patch to get rid of the sawtooth collector graphing today</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:32:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; just need to restart the zenoss servers next tuesday to have it take effect</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:34:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm also done writing upgrade scripts to upgrade my zenoss boxes to ubuntu 10.04</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:34:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I'll be doing that next Tuesday if testing goes well this week</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:34:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; lots of fun</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:40:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; so is 3.0 going to come packages with it's own install of python 2.6 in the stack installer, or is it going to use the system python?</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:40:19] &lt;rmatte&gt;

right, but is python 2.6 going to be bundled with</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:43:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so they still bundle whatever they previously bundled</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:43:23] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yes</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:43:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:43:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:43:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; not the RPM though</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:43:33] &lt;rmatte&gt;

;)</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:44:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; makes sense</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:44:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; I like aptitude, but not that much</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:44:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:44:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I don't trust it that much, I should say</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:44:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; using the OS Python would make it easier to add libraries though</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:44:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; true</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:45:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; but oh well, symlinks work</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:45:01] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; like ssl, odbc and libvirt</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:45:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, libvirt was a pain</p><p>[26-May-2010 16:45:43] &lt;rmatte&gt;

maybe we can just ask all users to do fresh installs? :p</p><p>[26-May-2010 17:24:01] &lt;SEJeff&gt; Once you're able to use os installed python, then you can think about re-orging the files from /opt/zenoss to something FHS compliant.

lemme try by it's IP</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:19:54] * chemist applies patches</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:20:11] &lt;Filbert&gt; nothing returned for the IP either</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:20:23] &lt;Filbert&gt; or FQDN</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:20:28] &lt;Filbert&gt; it'd have been one of those</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:20:29] &lt;rocket&gt; Filbert: did you run zencheckrels to make sure your relationships are fixed?</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:20:40] &lt;Filbert&gt; nope</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:20:56] &lt;Filbert&gt; how do I do that?</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:21:09] &lt;Filbert&gt; oh, its' a comment</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:21:11] &lt;Filbert&gt; er, command</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:21:13] &lt;rocket&gt; Filbert: also make sure you are running 2.5.2 if you haven't upgraded .. earlier versions have problems with broken relationships</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:21:21] &lt;Filbert&gt; ah, we're on 2.5.1</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:21:28] &lt;rocket&gt; get to 2.5.2 asap</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:21:38] &lt;rocket&gt; 2.5.1 will eat your lunch....</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:21:52] &lt;Filbert&gt; lol</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:22:02] &lt;Filbert&gt; ok, was planning ona n upgrade earlier</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:22:14] &lt;Filbert&gt; but everything is such a mess here, I was hoping I could put it off for a few weeks ;)</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:22:50] &lt;Filbert&gt; zenchkrels running now</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:24:50] &lt;Filbert&gt; it seems to be fixing some stuff</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:31:42] * Filbert taps his fingers</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:31:47] &lt;Filbert&gt; not a very quick process... :/</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:31:53] &lt;Filbert&gt; although that might be the size of our ZenOss install</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:39:49] &lt;rocket&gt; unfortunately it may crap out if other things access the db at the same time</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:42:58] &lt;Simon4&gt; it only commits at the end?</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:43:21] &lt;Simon4&gt; or does it commit after each rel fix?</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:44:09] &lt;rocket&gt; cant remember .. looking...</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:45:49] &lt;rocket&gt; just at the end .. but it could be changed pretty easily</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:46:01] &lt;rocket&gt; Products/ZenUtils/CheckRelations.py</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:46:23] &lt;Simon4&gt; cool</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:46:48] &lt;rocket&gt; it does set savepoints though .. so it should resume ..</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:47:16] &lt;rocket&gt; Ideally you do this on a system where nothing is happening though .. no modelling all other daemons are down etc</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:47:25] &lt;rocket&gt; but it can take a long time</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:47:46] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, considering doing it on a dedicated spare box</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:47:57] &lt;Simon4&gt; jsut after zeoctl start</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:48:02] &lt;mray&gt; rocket: is zenchkrels documented anywhere?</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:48:32] &lt;rocket&gt; mray: I am not sure if it is .. ( from our perspective we dont use it too much as it is pretty slow )</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:48:58] &lt;rocket&gt; mray: but it is important to anyone who was running 2.5.1 to run it to fix their corrupt zodb</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:48:59] &lt;mray&gt; rocket: I'm gonna open a ticket for it</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:49:16] &lt;Simon4&gt; rocket: so suggestion is, run zenchkrels, then upgrade to 2.5.2?</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:49:20] &lt;rocket&gt; mray: we need to improve it ..</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:49:24] &lt;rocket&gt; Simon4: yes</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:49:27] &lt;Simon4&gt; before restarting any other daemons etc</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:49:33] &lt;Simon4&gt; awesome, will try early next week</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:49:43] * Simon4 would love to not have to repair relations every second breath</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:49:45] &lt;mray&gt; rocket: I didn't even know what it did</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:50:04] &lt;rocket&gt; mray: it checks zope relations and tries to repair them</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:50:31] &lt;rocket&gt; mray: eg there is a flaw in 2.5.1 where half of the relation could be deleted and the other half exists</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:50:45] &lt;rocket&gt; in certain instances</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:50:56] &lt;rocket&gt; specifically if making changes from zendmd in 2.5.1</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:51:29] &lt;rocket&gt; then when you try and follow certain relationships and it crosschecks you get tracebacks etc</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:52:00] &lt;rocket&gt; internally for enterprise customers we are a bit more surgical about fixing these relationships and have an adhoc tool to do so</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:52:28] &lt;rocket&gt; but we *always* recommend getting off 2.5.0/1 and moving to 2.5.2</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:52:43] &lt;Filbert&gt; looks like I know what I'm doing tomorrow then :)</p><p><span>[27-May-2010 10:53:24] &lt;mray&gt; rocket: feel free to spice up </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/6809">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/6809</a></p><p>[27-May-2010 10:53:27] &lt;rocket&gt; 2.5.2 specifically fixes the issues as far as we know that the zodb can get into an inconsistent state</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:58:36] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Oh, hello</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:59:14] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Are there any plans of building WMI into core?</p><p>[27-May-2010 10:59:15] * Simon4 plots a 2.5.2 upgrade sooner than going to enterprise after reading those comments</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:00:18] &lt;rocket&gt; Simon4: have a support contract?</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:00:29] &lt;mray&gt; theacolyte: WMI is already in Core, that's how Windows event log and services are monitored</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:00:33] &lt;Simon4&gt; rocket: oui</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:00:42] &lt;mray&gt; theacolyte: or do you mean the WMI Data Source?</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:00:57] &lt;Simon4&gt; yes, even</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:01:19] &lt;rocket&gt; Simon4: let me look for a KB article for a tool that you should run instead</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:01:24] &lt;Simon4&gt; rocket: thanks</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:01:25] &lt;theacolyte&gt; mray: Ah, I thought event logs were provided by egor's plugin</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:01:38] &lt;theacolyte&gt; But regardless, yes the WMI datasource</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:01:53] &lt;mray&gt; theacolyte: nothing solid yet, but there have been discussions</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:02:13] &lt;rocket&gt; Simon4: "Using ZenFixIt to Correct Common Zenoss Issues"</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:02:40] * Simon4 goes hunting</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:02:43] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Hyperic really did it right for WMI I think - the counters are all in there, you just select them</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:02:45] &lt;rocket&gt; Simon4: thats a more surgical repair .. but may not catch everything</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:02:51] &lt;theacolyte&gt; No need to look up classes to remember where it's located</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:03:01] &lt;Simon4&gt; k, i"ll try it out on a copy of the db early next week</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:03:05] &lt;rocket&gt;

oh</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:36:29] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I have one</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:36:45] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Up/down monitoring for interfaces - is there any movement in that direction?</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:40:52] &lt;Simon4&gt; didn't rmatte write a doc on how to do that?</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:42:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: I didn't write the doc, I just modified it to be more current</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:42:27] &lt;rmatte&gt;

that's the doc</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:43:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; It works great, I use it to do all my port monitoring</p><p>[27-May-2010 11:43:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's more effective than traps in my opinion</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:03:41] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hmm</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:03:46] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah I'll have to revisit it</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:03:55] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Just seems that it's a big hole in the current out of box setup</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:03:59] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Maybe a checkbox for up/down?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:07:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that would be good</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:08:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; since I can't select to monitor the utilization of ports without monitoring up/down unless I create local copies of interface templates and remove the up/down monitoring, which is basically impossible</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:08:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; so hopefully that gets added as a feature in the future</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:12:51] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yea</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:15:44] &lt;jonny330&gt; I need help setting up the HP proliant zenpack anyone know how that works?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:18:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; jonny330: did you read the ZenPack page?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:18:55] &lt;jonny330&gt; yeah i did waht it said but its not woking</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:19:00] &lt;jonny330&gt; *working</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:19:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; jonny330: it's not hard, just install the pack and drop the devices in the class that the pack creates</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:19:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; and make sure the templates are bound to that class</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:19:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; what's not working about it?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:19:39] &lt;jonny330&gt; no information</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:19:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you remodel?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:19:50] &lt;jonny330&gt; yes</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:19:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you sure snmp is configured properly on your devices?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:20:10] &lt;jonny330&gt; now let me ask you this i used the ip address of the iLo port on the server</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:20:15] &lt;rocket&gt; restart zenoss after install zenpack?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:20:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt that's going to work</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:20:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need the IP of the server itself</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:20:27] &lt;jonny330&gt; am i supposed to do is that way or point it at windows?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:20:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, are you able to snmpwalk the ilo?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:21:02] &lt;jonny330&gt; didn't try let me check</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:21:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm honestly not sure if that pack is supposed to be pointed at the server itself or not</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:21:59] &lt;jonny330&gt; yeah thats what people keep telling me</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:22:19] &lt;jonny330&gt; i don't see why i cant just point it at the ilo port isan't that what it is there for?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:22:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; bigegor wrote the pack</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:22:50] &lt;jonny330&gt; yeah i have been trying to talk to him</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:22:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can't "just point something" at an IP unless you know that it's actually going to dish back details</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:23:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I assume the pack uses snmp</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:23:28] &lt;jonny330&gt; well the ip had all the information in there it does ssh, telnet, http, etc</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:23:50] &lt;rocket&gt; HP Insight Management Agents on monitored system ... so that implies you connect to windows</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:24:01] &lt;rocket&gt; and need to have that tool installed</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:24:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; aha</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:24:05] &lt;rocket&gt; for it to work</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:24:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:24:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh I was just about to say what rocket said</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:24:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; it says that right on the zenpack page</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:24:29] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160; External Dependencies:</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:24:30] &lt;rmatte&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; HP Insight Management Agents on monitored system</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:24:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; so install that on the server, configure it properly, and point it at the server itself, not the iLO</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:25:18] &lt;jonny330&gt; oh i guess i didn't read it carefully</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:25:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, lol</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:25:34] &lt;jonny330&gt; well thats why we have irc right</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:25:43] &lt;jonny330&gt; help each other out</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:25:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; indeed</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:26:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: long time no talk, how are things in zenoss-land?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:26:29] &lt;jonny330&gt; i wanted to use the dell open mange port on a couple other servers do i have to do the same thing?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:26:35] &lt;rocket&gt; busy</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:26:40] &lt;rocket&gt; very very busy</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:26:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; jonny330: well, dell would be a different pack I would assume</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:27:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; rocket: that's good though, makes the days fly by</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:27:21] &lt;rocket&gt; yes it does ... always an interesting day being detective</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:27:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:28:04] &lt;jonny330&gt; yeah dell has a serate pack just wondering if anyone used it</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:28:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; nope, I haven't</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:28:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; though it's probably the same thing</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:28:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; need to make sure that you have whatever dell utility installed</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:28:55] &lt;jonny330&gt; that stinks</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:29:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you don't want to have 2 devices in Zenoss for each server</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:29:21] &lt;jonny330&gt; i really wanted to just get the reports directly out of the iLo and open manage ports</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:29:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; you want to be able to monitor the hardware and software at the same time</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:29:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it only makes sense</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:29:44] &lt;jonny330&gt; right but those ports have all the information i would need</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:29:58] &lt;rocket&gt; jonny you can always create your own zenpack .. if you can grab the info from the ilo ..</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:29:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; not really, let's say you want to monitor processes on the servers</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:30:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can't do that via iLO</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:30:14] &lt;jonny330&gt; i guess i am not too concered with the software</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:30:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; kind of weird, but ok</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:30:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; how would you know if the server froze up but the hardware kept rolling</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:30:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:30:51] &lt;jonny330&gt; i guess you wouldn't</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:30:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; exactly</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:30:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; and that is quite bad</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:31:13] &lt;jonny330&gt; yeah so it still wouldnt tell me what i needed</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:31:49] &lt;jonny330&gt; the whole point is to make sure the server is working. I just didnt' want to have to reliy on windows for anything</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:32:01] &lt;jonny330&gt; i hate windows</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:32:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh well, if windows isn't working, the server isn't working</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:32:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:32:33] &lt;jonny330&gt; right which is my biggest concern since windows is its own problem</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:32:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but that just means that it needs monitoring more than anything</p><p>[27-May-2010 12:32:57] &lt;rmatte&gt;

yeh</p><p>[31-May-2010 11:58:58] &lt;chachan&gt; other boss dont really care about, just want to know that everything it's ok</p><p>[31-May-2010 11:59:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss is great and very extendable since it's written in python</p><p>[31-May-2010 11:59:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; it has it's minor annoyances, but so does every product</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:03:03] &lt;chachan&gt; yep, it's understandable</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:07:46] &lt;willwh&gt; chachan: from a random user, to another random tester - Zenoss rocks</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:08:04] &lt;chachan&gt; willwh, :)</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:08:07] &lt;willwh&gt; I can't even begin to count the number of hours it's saved me since it's been running :)</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:08:37] &lt;chachan&gt; cool</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:09:18] &lt;chachan&gt; That's what I want to say very soon :)</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:13:30] &lt;willwh&gt; it takes a ilttle bit of time to get stuff tuned down the way you need it</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:13:35] &lt;willwh&gt; depending on what you're monitoring</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:13:48] &lt;willwh&gt; but once you get the hang of what to look for, it hardly takes any time at all :)</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:14:47] &lt;chachan&gt; :)</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:14:57] &lt;chachan&gt; that's what I looking for</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:19:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I used to suck at tuning stuff, but now that I've learned all the little tricks it's really easy</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:19:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll want to learn a bit of python so that you can do transforms if you need top</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:19:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; top*</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:19:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; errr</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:19:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; to****</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:19:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:20:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, time to figure out how to get my syslog clients not to send a syslog message for every damn UDP connection that is made since it's owning the events database on the zenoss server that monitors our other zenoss servers</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:21:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can't even load up the event history without the UI completely freezing up</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:24:29] &lt;chachan&gt; rmatte, I know python, I'm not a guru, but I understand the code and can write a little :p</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:24:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:25:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's all you really need</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:25:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not a guru but I'm fairly proficient</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:25:59] &lt;chachan&gt; do anyone use zenoss.cmd.linux.process?</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:26:51] &lt;chachan&gt; I'm getting an error when I model the device</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:28:18] &lt;chachan&gt; I'm going to lunch, I'll back soon, cya guys and thanks for the comments</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:32:29] * Simon4 tries to find a way to sneak more than one command into a zencommand via ssh</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:32:31] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; ugh is the sequence editing page ever going to get an update</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:32:49] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; i only have 15 entries and it's already quite onerous</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:33:39] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; no matter what i do it seems to end up just taking a random order :(</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:45:22] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; i hope i'm doing something wrong and this isn't a flaw of zenoss :v</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:51:57] &lt;Simon4&gt; otakup0pe: has always worked for me</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:52:14] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; with a sizable amount of event mappings i'm guessing</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:52:18] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; i have 16 which doesn't seem like a lot :(</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:53:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; woohoo, time to delete 100 million events from my event database on one of my servers</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:53:54] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; it's completely random too heh</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:55:03] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; i can literally hit save without modifying any of the numbers and it comes out different each time O_o</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:55:57] &lt;Simon4&gt; hmm, I haven't tried it in event mappings, but it works fine for resequencing things like graphpoints</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:57:25] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; it's only giving me problems on one of the eventkey's</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:58:18] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; hmm does sequence apply to event classes or event id's</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:58:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; otakup0pe: just change the value of the one you want to move if you're just moving 1</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:58:44] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; doesn't work</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:59:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, you said it works in graphs but not for transforms?</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:59:11] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; i haven't tried it with graphs</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:59:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I haven't tried resequencing transforms for quite a while</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:59:16] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; and in some of my sets of event mappings it works</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:59:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; try it with graphs and see if it works</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:59:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; it might be specific to transforms</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:59:38] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; it's working for some transforms</p><p>[31-May-2010 12:59:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe it's intelligently ordering them to some degree as well?</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:00:10] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; it's certainly trying.</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:00:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:00:17] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; but based on what ?</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:00:40] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; it's essentially rendered zenoss's event mapping feature useless to me. which is a shame because i was enjoying it.</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:00:53] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; maybe it's time to finally go for the commercial support ;)</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:01:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:01:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're a commercial client?</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:01:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, enterprise client, I should say</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:02:46] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; no still using zenoss core. this seems like something that must actually work and i'm just doing something wrong.</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:03:28] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; i seem to be able to resequence graphs in templates</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:11:37] &lt;Simon4&gt; hmm, collecting via ssh on a single Blade Chassis does a fairly good job of attempting to DOS the OA</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:16:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:17:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; otakup0pe: it's very possible that it's a bug</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:17:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; new ones pop up all the time</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:17:22] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; :3</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:17:40] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; i'll see if i can distill it into a coherent report</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:17:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; one release you can set hardware info for devices, the next you can't, the next you sort of can</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:17:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:17:52] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; i really don't have time to come up with a repro though</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:23:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, does anyone know if there's a place to crank up the timeout value on the new event console?</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:23:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; when I click to load the event history it cranks for about 1 minute then I get a server connection error</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:23:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's driving me absolutely insane</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:35:29] &lt;Simon4&gt; not sure, I think it's loaded via ajax, so you may need to dig into javascript (ugh)</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:45:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; lame lol</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:45:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll see if clearing the entire events database improves the situation</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:45:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not having the same problem on any of my other servers</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:46:58] * Simon4 plays with ZenPack skins... possibly my least favourite bit of ZenPack dev</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:53:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never tried to do skins yet</p><p>[31-May-2010 13:54:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; I just end up finding something that looks like what I want, and copy/paste it, not very scientific</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:08:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:41:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, I think something is seriously wrong with mysql on this Zenoss server</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:45:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup it is, great</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:46:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; on other servers I can do "select * from detail;" or "select * from historyl;", on this one it just freezes up, which explains why I can't load the event history on it</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:50:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; now the question is, how the heck am I going to fix that...</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:51:53] &lt;Simon4&gt; drop table history? :)</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:53:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh but then I lose the whole table and need to recreate it</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:53:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; but that is an option on this one particular server</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:53:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; it wouldn't be on any other</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:54:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; could I just do something like delete * from history; first?</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:54:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; just to try?</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:54:21] &lt;Simon4&gt; yup</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:54:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, the log table is fine</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:54:42] &lt;chachan&gt; truncate table history</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:54:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; same with heartbeat and alert</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:54:52] &lt;chachan&gt; I think that's the command</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:54:55] &lt;Simon4&gt; when you say "freezes up" do you just mean appears to never come back? or does the mysql process actually die?</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:55:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: appears to never come back</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:55:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: I have TONS of events in the database, but I told Zenoss to delete events older than 1 day so it should have gone through and deleted them all</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:55:42] &lt;Simon4&gt; hmm, is there still a delete process happening?</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:55:49] &lt;Simon4&gt; show processlist on the mysql commandline</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:56:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; nope</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:56:27] &lt;Simon4&gt; it would be worth checking that whilst doing a select count(*) from history; also, see what your select process is up to</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:56:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; k</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:57:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; running that right now</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:57:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have problems querrying the detail table as well</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:57:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; all the others work fine</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:57:46] &lt;Simon4&gt; a huge flood of recent events could cause this I guess, fill both tables to the point where mysql struggles</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:58:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; | 11 | zenoss | localhost | events | Query&#160;&#160; |&#160;&#160; 97 | Sending data | select count(*) from history |</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:59:00] &lt;Simon4&gt; k, it thinks it's running okay</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:59:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not even recent, I was receiving tons of UDP connection syslogs from servers, which I just fixed today</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:59:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; but now I need to clean up the mess and get it back to normal</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:59:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; there we go</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:59:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; mysql&gt; select count(*) from history;</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:59:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; +----------+</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:59:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; | count(*) |</p><p>[31-May-2010 14:59:35] &lt;rmatte&gt;

lol</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:00:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; guess I should kill all the events</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:00:35] &lt;Simon4&gt; try select * from history LIMIT 10;</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:00:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; is truncate the command do that?</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:00:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; LIMIT 10?</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:00:45] &lt;Simon4&gt; see if that retursn</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:00:47] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:00:55] &lt;Simon4&gt; says give me the first 10 entries from that table;</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:01:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, it does</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:01:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; same for detail</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:01:43] &lt;Simon4&gt; what does select count(*) from detail; give you?</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:02:08] &lt;Simon4&gt; (may take a minute or two to finish)</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:02:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's nice to have a refresher on mysql, haven't really worked with it much since college lol</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:02:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I'll give it some time</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:04:36] &lt;Simon4&gt; truncate looks like the fast way to empty the table, basically in the background mysql just drops the existing one and creates a new one with the same schema</p><p><span>[31-May-2010 15:05:09] &lt;Simon4&gt;

You could create a job for this :)</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:17:43] &lt;chachan&gt; but, I have a question</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:17:58] &lt;chachan&gt; are history and detail in relationship?</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:19:48] &lt;rmatte&gt;

yup</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:26:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; it worked great for me</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:27:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: thanks for the help</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:28:29] &lt;Simon4&gt; no probs</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:32:06] &lt;rmatte&gt;

(ones which show details on what used to be a details tab and is now mashed in with all the other info)</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:41:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; I hope they fix that, I want to see a second link just for event details</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:42:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; rather than having to comb through all the other garbage</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:42:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; it was great when it was on it's own tab</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:42:44] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah</p><p><span>[31-May-2010 15:42:56] &lt;Simon4&gt;

that would ahve been embarassing</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:57:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; chachan: yeh, it's called a command based datasource</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:58:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; which you can do with a script on the local server or with a command via SSH</p><p>[31-May-2010 15:58:30] &lt;rmatte&gt;

the output of a snmpwalk 1.3.6.1.4.1.2.3.51.2.2 would probably be enough to knock something up fairly easily</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:18:23] &lt;Simon4&gt; Dear HP, take a leaf out of IBM's book and do SNMP properly, love, SImon</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:21:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:21:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; HP do SNMP horribly</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:21:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; specially with interface names for blade switches</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:21:53] &lt;rmatte&gt;

gack</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:22:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; no indication as to port numbers or anything in the names</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:22:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; ifDescr is that, and ifName is blank</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:22:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; super super stupid</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:23:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; one of the guys here complained that there weren't proper interface names for the blade switches in Zenoss, so I asked him what he wanted me to do beyond mailing a letter to HP to ask them to stop being idiots</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:24:01] &lt;chachan&gt; I have a noob question, is snmp secure for use on public and production servers?</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:24:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; the SNMP on their regular user port switches isn't bad at all</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:24:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's all their higher end stuff that tends to suck</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:24:07] &lt;forsberg&gt; have linkss switch with same problem -&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Ethernet Interface</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:24:18] &lt;forsberg&gt; can give them descr tho</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:24:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's no annoying</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:24:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; so*</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:24:32] &lt;forsberg&gt; linksys switch</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:24:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but giving a description doesn't really help when Zenoss tells you that utilization is exceeded on Ethernet Interface</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:25:04] &lt;Simon4&gt; chachan: you need to run snmpv3 to get any kind of decent authentication and encryption</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:25:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; jeez, thanks</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:25:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:25:16] &lt;forsberg&gt; je :)</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:25:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I actually wish Zenoss would allow you to manually assign names to interfaces</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:25:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; it would be a nice workaround for dumb devices</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:25:42] &lt;bigegor&gt; HP is good, but IBM is nightmare ;)</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:25:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; neither are good</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:26:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; they both need to take a page from Cisco in my opinion</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:26:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; Cisco SNMP is actually done properly</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:26:13] &lt;chachan&gt; Simon4, mm, in this case, which one do you recommend me, ssh or snmp?</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:26:37] &lt;rmatte&gt;

it supports more than the ssh plugins do</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:31:05] &lt;chachan&gt; rmatte, mmm, It see that, but I though that I could figure out some ssh plugins, I guess isn't so easy, isn't it?</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:32:38] &lt;forsberg&gt; there is many ways to do it, and combine ways of monitoring</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:33:10] &lt;forsberg&gt; i use snmp for everything basic, but sometimes i have to make script/ssh something to monitor it, or call remote stuff via snmp</p><p>[31-May-2010 16:34:24] &lt;chachan&gt;
