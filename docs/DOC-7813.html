check_ping, yes, that's what i was going to use...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 13:54:44] &lt;kobalt&gt; s/no/not<br/>[07-Jun-2010 13:54:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; we don't monitor an enormous number of devices by any means, it's around 500.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 13:54:47] &lt;mray&gt; kobalt: too much overhead running that many commands?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 13:55:08] &lt;kobalt&gt; mray, it takes about 20 seconds to run the command<br/>[07-Jun-2010 13:55:15] &lt;mray&gt; kobalt: per device?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 13:55:21] &lt;kobalt&gt;

our network monitoring department is just used to it, and i know they're going to complain if they don't have something similar with zenoss.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 13:55:56] &lt;mray&gt; well&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; there is a half-finished example somewhere for doing it with Twisted<br/>[07-Jun-2010 13:56:16] &lt;kobalt&gt; it could be my setup but I could not get it under about 9 seconds for the localhost (pinging the server that zenoss is on)<br/>[07-Jun-2010 13:56:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so this isn't something that's built-into zenoss?&#160; seems like it would be something that is pretty desirable for routers...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 13:56:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; for monitoring routers that is.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 13:56:53] &lt;mray&gt;

well, more when I'm actually adding devices rather<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:20:25] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: perhaps try "Push Changes"?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:20:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; no indication in the log as to why it crashed though<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:20:42] &lt;coofamani&gt;

is that slated for release soon...?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:23:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, the beta is due out soon, it's currently still in Alpha<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:23:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i thought i saw a beta or alpha release...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:23:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; then the final release will be a few months after the beta drops<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:23:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea... must've been alpha.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:23:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; cool.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:24:15] &lt;rmatte&gt;

and it's very powerful<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:25:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea.&#160; we used NMIS previously.&#160; it was pretty customizable, but ugly as hell to look at and ridiculously difficult to configure.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:25:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; It took me about 6 months to get a good hang of it, then another 6 months to pretty much be able to do anything with it<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:25:57] &lt;aclark&gt; is version 2.5.70 from docs/DOC-5854#installer really 3.0 alpha ?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:26:08] &lt;rmatte&gt;

interesting.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:27:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; looks like a fairly complete rewrite<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:27:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; of the UI that is.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:28:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it is<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:29:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; they've had most of the devs working on it for a while now<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:29:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i like it!<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:29:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:29:30] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

and then a few other kinks to work out, and i hopefully will be done.&#160; the big chore of adding all the devices is already done.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:30:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, what's not working in the graphS?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:31:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ... the graphs themselves...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:31:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; are they just not there at all?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:31:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; he help me setup a performance monitor for ping response time.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:31:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; or are they there but not loading<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:31:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; or are you getting missing rrd file messages<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:31:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; or are you seeing "nan" for the values?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:31:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well, the graph exists.&#160; but there's no points plotted.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:31:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; do you see any errors on the graphs relating to RRD?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:32:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i have a ping loss and RTA graph setup.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:32:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; not on the graph itself, do you mean in the log files<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:32:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:32:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, I mean on the graph itself<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:32:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; describe what you're seeing on the graph?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:32:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nope, the graph itself looks great.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:32:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

oh, you only added the thresholds it looks like<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:35:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; not the datapoints themselves<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:35:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; edit the graphs and add the datapoints<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:35:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i believe i have datapoints... okie.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:35:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; with datapoints you'd see something beside the name like: cur:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; avg:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

right, you need to go in to the graph and add them to it<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:36:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; LOSS and RTA<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:36:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; you have thresholds called LOSS and RTA too I assume?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:36:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol if that's it<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:37:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you don't then I'm boggled<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:37:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i thought i did that<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:37:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; you might have selected to add thresholds instead of a graphpoints by accident<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:37:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; perhaps i didn't.&#160; there were a lot of steps, and mray did a great job of walking me thru but i kinda rushed him and he may have skipped some steps.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:37:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:38:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; now i'm getting 'MISSING RRD FILE:' on the graphs...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:39:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea i have the thresholds on the graph<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:39:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but not the data points.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:40:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; how is the data actually being collected for the graphpoints?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:40:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; or should I say datapoints<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:40:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you using a script?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:40:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok so i 'fixed' RTA...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:41:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; 1 sec.&#160; i probably caused this cluster%@#$ myself.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:41:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:44:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; to answer your question, i'm just using a command - check_ping<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:44:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:44:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; what does the output look like?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:44:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i'm not sure what's wrong.&#160; the RTA is working now, but loss i get "missing RRD file"..<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:44:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, when you run a test on the datasource against a device, what does the output look like?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:45:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; click on the datasource in your template, you'll see a test input box, throw in the name of a device and click test<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:45:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; paste the output<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:45:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; sure, 1 sec.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:48:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; PING OK|loss=0 RTA=50.52 |rta=50.521999ms;180.000000;300.000000;0.000000 pl=0%;100;100;0<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:48:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; /opt/zenoss/common/libexec/check_ping -H ${here/manageIp} -w 180,100% -c300,100% |sed -e 's# - Packet loss#|loss#;s#%,##;s#ms##;s# = #=#g'<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:48:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

LOSS<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:49:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; then that's your problem<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:49:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's case sensitive<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:49:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; hence why RTA is working but LOSS is not<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:49:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; RTA as well?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:49:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; d'oh.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:50:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can rename it on the graph to LOSS so that it doesn't look funny<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:50:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; but the datapoint itself needs to be called loss<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:50:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; either that or adjust the command to output as LOSS instead of loss<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:52:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok, now i'm getting nan on all the points.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:52:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; perhaps patience is best now <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:52:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, I'll give you another trick... once the graphpoints are added to the graph, you can click on them, and in format you'll see something like 5.2%lf%s<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:52:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you remove the %s at the end, it'll make it so that Zenoss always displays the actual numerical value<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:52:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; because by default it had a tendency to convert 0.0001 to 1m or whatever<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:53:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; and 1000000 to 1M<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:53:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; or 10000000000 to 1G<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:53:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is undesirable in this case<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:53:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; it would be fine if it were memory or something<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:53:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; now that they are showing "nan" just wait 3 polling cycles (about 15 minutes) and you should start seeing values<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:54:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; alrighty<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:54:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm going to do some adjustment of the naming so these graphs make more sense...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:54:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:59:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so are the graphs supposed to be tied to eachother?&#160; when i zoom one in or change the time on one graph, all the other graphs on the page change with it...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:59:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nvm<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:59:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm an idiot<br/>[07-Jun-2010 15:59:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; 'link graphs' check box <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:01:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:01:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, they are linked by default since it's usually useful when troubleshooting issues<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:02:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, at first i was perplexed.&#160; then i just accepted it.&#160; now that i'm poking around i figured i would ask, and now that check box makes sense haha.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:02:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:02:30] &lt;rmatte&gt;

it's all IPSLA stuff on a router<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:03:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; fortunately we just use this for monitoring up/down pretty much.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:03:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:03:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I use it for all sorts of fun stuff<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:03:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i know the management is going to want it to do a lot more, which is why i am trying to find a product that can scale with their wants.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:03:35] &lt;rmatte&gt;

mix of everything?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:05:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; probably 40% are windows.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:05:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; maybe even less, i'm not sure.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:05:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i just do the network stuff.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:07:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm.&#160; i don't know if i like this.&#160; it keeps labeling devices as down when they are in fact up...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:08:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; are the devices actually pingable though?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:08:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yep<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:08:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you can ping them from the zenoss box itself?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:08:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; perhaps i have this template set a little too sensitive<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:08:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i just clicked on a device went to the drop down and did a ping, came back no problem.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:08:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, there's built in ping monitoring and then there's that<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:09:00] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:09:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; if Zenoss is actually showing the device as down it's doing that with it's own ping monitoring<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:09:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it seems to be labeling it as down from the threshold i set on the ping loss<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:09:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you go to Settings -&gt; Daemons and click view log next to zenping it might give you an idea as to why<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:09:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i said to go critical if it gets a loss of greater than 5<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:09:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:10:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; should i set that to something different?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:10:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; depends on how much loss you expect to see<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:10:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well i *shouldn't* be seeing any<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:10:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; check the graph, is it spiking over the threshold?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:10:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yes<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:10:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; some are getting 16 or more<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:10:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you may want to set it higher, or figure out why the values are so high<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:11:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; WARNING zen.ZenPing: Configuration still loading.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:11:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i see a lot of those in the log file<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:11:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:12:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure if that's really a big deal<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:12:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; I recall seeing that before too<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:12:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you said you're getting events from the threshold<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:12:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i guess i could just set that value to something that's not critical<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:12:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; not actualy ip 10.10.10.10 is down style events<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:12:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; actual*<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:12:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; because zenoss has been great at identifying 'down' devices before i added these graphs/thresholds.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:13:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, but when you're saying "down" what is the actual description of the events that you're seeing?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:13:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; are they like: ip 10.0.0.1 is down<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:13:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; or are they like: threshold of LOSS exceeded: current value 5<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:13:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; threshold of Loss threshold exceeded...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:14:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, then it's to do with the template, not zenping<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:14:04] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; some are as high as 50<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:14:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; indeed.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:14:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so am i doubling up on the pinging by doing this?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:14:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; either way, the command is returning those values<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:14:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i don't want zenoss to hammer all the devices more than it needs to.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:14:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; so either crank up the threshold values<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:14:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; or figure out what's causing values to be that high<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:14:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:15:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; bare in mind that the pings are going to occur during a collection cycle<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:15:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; so those devices will be dishing out snmp info while they are being pinged<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:15:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; so that could cause increased latency<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:15:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm just wondering if this check_ping is pinging above and beyond what the normal zenping is doing...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:15:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'd really just like to have graphical stats on what zenping is doing.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:15:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenping really only sends 3 ping packets per device<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:15:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure what check_ping does<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:16:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, it seems like i may be doubling up the pinging... that's not desirable at all.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:16:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; Do you actually need ping graphing?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:16:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; need is such a strong word<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:17:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; I personally just rely on zenping, it does a good job<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:17:03] &lt;Simon4_&gt; you could set ping monitor to ignore in the zproperties to kill zenping off and see if it stops the issue<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:17:14] &lt;Simon4_&gt; but I just use zenping<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:17:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, there's a zPingMonitorIgnore option in zProperties<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:17:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; we have it with our current network monitoring system... it graphs the response times.&#160; so if there's a drop, the monitors can easily see the time period that it dropped.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:17:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could toggle that to tell zenping not to monitor that device<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:17:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, well, if you're used to it then you might as well keep it<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:18:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'd rather let zenping do its thing and just use the results from it...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:18:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; I mean, you already have it setup<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:18:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; someone was talking about making a smokeping zenpack, I wonder if they ever got anywhere with that<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:18:30] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea.&#160; if we lose features, there's going to be complaining.&#160; i want to keep that to a minimum if i can.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:18:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; compare the values you're seeing to the the values in the current monitoring system<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:18:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; see if they are comparable<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:19:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; perhaps those response time levels are normal<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:19:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, bare in mind that those are probably milliseconds, not seconds<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:19:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; so 5 is not high at all<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:19:25] &lt;zykes-&gt; i love zenoss...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:19:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i know it's milliseconds, the 5 value i'm talking about it dropped packets.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:19:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; heck, even 100ms is reasonable<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:19:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:20:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; but is it percentage of dropped or number of dropped?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:20:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i have response time threshold set to 300<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:20:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; number of dropped<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:20:18] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i believe<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:20:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; any idea how many times it's pinging each device each cycle?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:22:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; good question, i can't really tell.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:23:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; check the script<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:23:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; or what options are being passed to it<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:25:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well the script seems to be compiled<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:25:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i can't read it<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:25:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; really?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:25:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and there is a -p switch to specify packets<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:25:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but i don't use it.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:25:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:25:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wonder what it defaults to<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:26:04] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea it's in &lt;zenoss&gt;/common/libexec/check_ping<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:26:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; see if you can google and find out or something<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:26:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mray, you around?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:26:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's the nagios check_ping script I think (could be wrong)<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:26:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i believe you are correct<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:26:40] &lt;mray&gt; what's up?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:26:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; do you know how many times check_ping actually pings the device?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:26:58] &lt;mray&gt; no idea<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:27:12] &lt;Simon4_&gt; tcpdump says 5<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:27:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; zenping seems to be doing a great job of monitoring up states, but since i incorporated check_ping i'm showing a ton of loss.&#160; so it's flagging the devices as down.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:27:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mray, so since zenping is already pinging my devices, is there no way to just use the stats from that to create graphs?&#160; it seems like i'm pinging the devices doubly now.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:28:34] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: I don't think so<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:28:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; bummer.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:28:50] &lt;mray&gt; pretty sure zenping is just availability<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:29:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; man, some of the way Zenoss handles products is a bit outdated lol<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:29:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; now i get two alerts when a device goes down.&#160; i changed the threshold so it has to drop 20 pings before it flags it.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:29:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's a group for Airespace, Inc (formerly Black Storm Networks) but they've been acquired by Cisco<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:29:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; now I need to figure out how to re-categorize them under cisco<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:30:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:30:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i think i'll just avoid the whole mess and remove the max threshold on the loss section...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:30:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it definitely seems like this 'solution' creates a ton more network traffic than is necessary tho.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:30:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:31:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenping is pretty gentle, hence why I haven't bothered with ping scripts<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:31:13] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: you could replace check_ping with /usr/bin/ping<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:31:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i love that zenoss is this customizable, but damn.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:31:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mray, but zenping would still be pinging all my devices as well... how does that change anythign?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:31:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; anything.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:31:50] &lt;mray&gt; well, check_ping appears to be doing 5 pings<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:31:50] &lt;Simon4_&gt; arrrghhh: check_ping sends 5 pings, so if it's dropping all 5 something is wierd.. nothing in zencommand.log?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:32:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah, i could limit the # of pings...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:32:09] &lt;Simon4_&gt; it could be parsing the output wrong<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:32:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; Simon4_, 1 sec<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:32:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: you can tell zenping not to, the only thing is, if a device goes down you won't see the device status change to down, so if you run an availability report everything will always be at 100% availaility<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:32:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; availability*<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:32:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol sounds good for SLA's!<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:32:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; since it relies on events generated by zenping<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:33:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; Simon4_, nothing in the logs that would indicate an issue witht hat...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:33:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:35:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; sounds good for SLAs until you have to explain why you didn't see such and such server go down for 2 days<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:35:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:35:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hahaha, yea pretty much.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:36:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; perhaps zenoss is more than we need...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:36:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; well not really, you can scale it up or down as much as you want<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:36:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the beauty of it<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:37:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well there some things that zenoss does very well, but there's some simple things that seemingly have been forgotten about.&#160; that's why i say it's more than we need, it seems much more geared towards server monitoring<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:38:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; from my perspective, i really just need something that monitors up/down status.&#160; something with more information about the switches/routers would be great, but not required.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:42:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you can just stick stuff in the /Ping group and call it a day <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:42:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:42:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; if it was only that simple...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:43:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; honestly though, full SNMP monitoring is fairly invaluable in my opinion<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:43:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; up/down doesn't always really cut it<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:43:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; agreed.&#160; i love the information i get from SNMP.&#160; very cool.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:43:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus, you can have a server that's frozen but pingable<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:43:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; which we always catch with SNMP Agent down events<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:43:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well, again from my perspective this is for our network monitoring department.&#160; they don't really keep a watchful eye on servers.&#160; that's another department <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:44:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:44:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss is fantastic for network stuff<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:44:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i'm doing all this work for something that i'm not really going to use once it's up haha.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:44:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; on that box with 400 devices we're doing full SNMP monitoring on pretty much everything<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:44:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; there are maybe like 10 devices that we only do ping monitoring on<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:44:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:45:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it's the same story with the rest of my Zenoss servers<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:45:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; out of that 400, about 320 are network devices<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:45:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i guess i could turn off the ping monitoring?&#160; i'm not sure.&#160; i like the information i get from snmp, but i also know that the monitors really like using the response times graphs so they can visually see how long an outage lasted.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:46:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; 160 routers and 160 switches<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:46:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:46:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; you just need to go in to zProperties<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:46:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; and set zPingMonitorIgnore to True<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:46:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; do it at the root level of /Devices<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:47:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure if that'll actually fix the threshold issues that you're seeing though<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:47:27] &lt;MWT&gt; Hi guys, im back again...<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:47:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i think i fixed the threshold problem.<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:47:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:47:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; do you see yourself using the availability report?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:47:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; or is that more of a nice to have?<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:48:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; MWT: hi<br/>[07-Jun-2010 16:48:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

ooo a beta<br/>[08-Jun-2010 11:53:33] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Is there a new feature list someplace that I've missed because I didn't look very hard?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 11:53:55] &lt;mray&gt; theacolyte: good question, I'll get Product Management to start one<br/>[08-Jun-2010 11:54:05] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hehe<br/>[08-Jun-2010 11:54:22] &lt;theacolyte&gt; mray: Actually been meaning to ask - your jive implementation... do you use it for both internal and external?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 11:54:25] &lt;bbibeault&gt; I have seen a number of little postings that mention it, but there are quite a few changes.&#160; The new UI is the biggest I think, followed closely by python 2.6/zope 2.12.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 11:54:28] &lt;theacolyte&gt; (like intranet, and your public facing websites)<br/>[08-Jun-2010 11:56:57] &lt;theacolyte&gt; bbibeault: May want to also add the login information on public-demo.zenoss.com - I know it because it's just the default, but some may not<br/>[08-Jun-2010 11:57:14] &lt;bbibeault&gt; Good call, thanks, will update that.&#160; admin/zenoss, right?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 11:57:29] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah<br/>[08-Jun-2010 11:57:46] &lt;theacolyte&gt; oh man the new interface is rockin<br/>[08-Jun-2010 11:59:05] &lt;theacolyte&gt; One of these days I'd love to see a redesigned report interface hehe<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:01:01] &lt;bbibeault&gt; Well, the way reports are organized and added has been "fixed", imo.&#160; Reorganized that page, got rid of the weird rules (like can't add a multigraph report without being in the multigraph report organizer).<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:01:23] &lt;bbibeault&gt; I have heard that updating the reports themselves is on the horizon for consideration going forward (which I think is what you are looking for)<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:01:55] &lt;theacolyte&gt; bbibeault: Yeah, looksl ike it is a lot better, but I mean like - draggable metrics<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:02:26] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Like uptime for this device folder<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:03:17] &lt;bbibeault&gt; I haven't heard anything about that on the roadmap.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:03:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, draggable metrics so that you can essentially build your own custom report with everything you want all on one page<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:03:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then export it<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:03:34] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:03:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; think dashboard, but as a report<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:03:37] &lt;theacolyte&gt; that'd be just amazing<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:03:59] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I don't do any reporting right now because I can't readily figure out how to write the report statements <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:03:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; that would be the icing on the cake and would make the reports much more powerful<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:04:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; we generate monthly reports for our clients via a bunch of custom scripts that tap in to Zenoss, dump data, then sort it and format it<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:04:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it was a ton of work to develop<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:04:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; would have been nice if we could have just dragged and dropped to build what we wanted<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:05:12] &lt;bbibeault&gt; Do you two know if we have a detailed enhancement request that spells out the use case that you are looking for, with maybe examples etc?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:07:19] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'm not sure<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:07:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; bbibeault: probably not, I do plan on doing that at some point, but you guys aren't quite there yet.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:07:43] &lt;theacolyte&gt; rmatte: Oh, not a bad idea - I wonder if I can read the zenoss DB with SSRS<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:07:58] &lt;theacolyte&gt; oh<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:08:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: We just use python scripts that I wrote, which dump the data in csv format<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:08:05] &lt;theacolyte&gt; odbc &gt; mysql &gt; zenoss &gt; yay<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:08:12] &lt;bbibeault&gt; If you guys can document a solid use case around this, it can go onto the queue (get prioritized/etc)<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:08:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; then a php script that my manager wrote grabs the data and parses/formats it<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:08:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; bbibeault: I'll do that whenever I get some good time to devote to it<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:08:47] &lt;theacolyte&gt; rmatte: You should send that to me <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:09:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: can't send the php script, but I can pass some of the python scripts...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:09:14] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hehe<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:09:21] &lt;theacolyte&gt; nah, I think I'm liking this SSIS/SSRS idea<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:09:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; up to you<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:09:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; docs/DOC-4664<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:10:00] &lt;mray&gt; Reporting is being actively investigated for the next release, post 3.0.&#160; I know Product Management is doing a lot of research into how and what to present<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:10:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; those are it, though I've made more mods to them since, so that they spit out current thresholds values and such<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:10:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's fairly specific to our setup<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:11:28] &lt;bbibeault&gt; @mray - right, that's why I would like to get these enhancements in sooner rather than later.&#160; Also for reporting tickets and enhancements, please make sure to use the Reports component in Trac.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:11:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: In addition to the reporting, it would be nice to see some new portlets for the dashboard which show the top 10 whatever<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:11:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; clients absolutely love to see stuff like that<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:11:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; top 10 servers by CPU utilization<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:11:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; for instance<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:11:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; or top 10 lowest availability<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:12:00] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yar<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:12:04] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: feel free to contribute those in ZenPacks <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:12:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; If I manage to write one I shall<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:12:19] &lt;mray&gt; but I know they're working on reports like that for VMware<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:12:25] &lt;theacolyte&gt; mray: Did you see my question wrt jive?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:12:56] &lt;mray&gt; theacolyte: no, what was it?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:13:12] &lt;theacolyte&gt; mray: Do you use it for both internal and external? or just external?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:13:28] &lt;mray&gt; ahh, we have internal and external Jive instances<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:13:36] &lt;theacolyte&gt; So seperate entirely?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:13:38] &lt;mray&gt; Jive has replaced our intranet<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:13:39] &lt;mray&gt; yes<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:13:53] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Got it<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:13:57] &lt;mray&gt; separate, the internal is actually running on a newer version<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:14:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; Jive is very slick<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:14:04] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'm going to be deploying something - possibly jive - pretty soon<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:14:09] &lt;theacolyte&gt; knowledge management/social stuff<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:14:16] &lt;theacolyte&gt; mray: How do you like it?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:14:16] &lt;mray&gt; theacolyte: feel free to drop me any questions<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:14:23] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I definately will, thanks for the offer<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:14:42] &lt;mray&gt; I'm pretty happy with it, when we were searching for solutions it hit 90% of what we wanted out of the box<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:14:55] &lt;mray&gt; so our customizations are fairly minimal, which was a requirement<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:15:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only annoyance is the zipping of ZenPacks<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:15:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only one I still notice anyways<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:15:22] &lt;mray&gt; there are other annoyances, but yes, it has warts<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:15:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:15:34] &lt;mray&gt; the runner-up was MindTouch<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:15:38] &lt;theacolyte&gt; mray: What other products were you looking at? confluence/mindtouch?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:15:39] &lt;theacolyte&gt; yeah<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:15:50] &lt;mray&gt; and if I was looking at other stuff today, I'd hit up Acquia<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:16:00] &lt;mray&gt; but we really didn't want something custom<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:16:07] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I've got the latest gartner magic quadrant for it, so I figure i'll look down the list<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:16:15] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'm pretty set on jive thoguh, I've been a fan since clearspace<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:16:59] &lt;mray&gt; MindTouch is really cool and cheaper, but would have required more Professional Services<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:17:16] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Yeah it seems very much more a wiki<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:17:35] &lt;mray&gt; well, it's a collaboration platform, so you can mashup just about anything<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:17:49] &lt;mray&gt; so integrating it with anything is really easy<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:18:03] &lt;theacolyte&gt; On the other hand, integrating jive seems very difficult<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:18:08] &lt;mray&gt; it is<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:19:07] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Another big downside with jive is.... it's very, very expensive<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:19:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so i keep adjusting zProperty values for my network, and I'm still getting a TON of 'bad OID' events...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:20:05] &lt;mray&gt; theacolyte: yeah, MindTouch was cheaper, but the PS work would have made them similar<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:20:14] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: ping rmatte on that<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:21:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, i have a lot of cisco devices in my network, and they keep creating these damned events for bad oid... it was suggested that I adjust the "zMaxOIDPerRequest" value, but it hasn't made a difference.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:21:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; what type of Cisco devices?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:21:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; routers, switches.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:21:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, the zMaxOIDPerRequest thing generally only applies to Cisco ASAs<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:21:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; 28xx router's for the most part.&#160; but we have all kinds.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:21:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never had to adjust it for any other Cisco devices<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:21:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm..<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:21:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; can you screenshot the events?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:22:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I want to see exactly what we're dealing with<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:22:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; someone on the forums suggested adjusting the zSnmpVer to v2c instead of 1.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:22:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; sure 1 sec<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:22:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's already up to 16,000 jeez.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:22:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's possible, though I use v1 to monitor a ton of Cisco devices and don't have any issues<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:22:45] &lt;theacolyte&gt; mray: thanks man, I'll probably have more questions as I get closer - I still need to send this out to our project manager to pick up<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:23:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/7808/screenshot6820101123.png<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:24:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that's just one page (obviously) but they all seem to be for endpoints in the devices.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:24:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; right ok, those are just debug messages<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:24:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; they're flooding in at an alarming rate tho...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:24:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; up to 18,000 now.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:24:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; basically what that tells you is that Voice Encapsulation interfaces don't support collection of certain OIDs<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:24:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; so what you need to do is this...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:25:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to one of those interfaces, click on it, and check what the type is<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:25:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; once you have the type, go to /Devices and copy the ethernetCsmacd template then rename it to match the type exactly<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:25:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; then figure out which OIDs it's complaining about based on the messages, and remove them from the template<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:26:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; also remove the threshold and graph associated with them<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:26:52] &lt;etank&gt; is there something wrong with this transform? http://pastebin.com/KWTqkx9s<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:27:15] &lt;etank&gt; i want it to drop events on that one machine every saturday between noon and 6pm<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:28:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; etank: since you're trying to do it based on time: blogs/zenossblog/2010/03/24/tip-of-the-month-time-sensitive-event-transforms<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:28:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, what do you mean remove the OIDs from the template?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:28:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: ok, I'll explain this as clearly as possible...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:29:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; by default, all interfaces are monitored using the ethernetCsmacd template<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:29:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; sorry for my ignorance <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:29:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it has a set of OIDs in the template that it attempts to collector from for each interface<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:29:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; the problem is that certain interface types don't support some of those OIDs<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:29:39] &lt;etank&gt; rmatte: that is essentially what i have i think<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:29:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; for instance, virtual interface types generally don't support collection of errors<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:30:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; so what you need to do is click on the interface that it's complaining about to find out the type<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:30:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; then copy the ethernetCsmacd template and rename it to that type<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:30:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; then Zenoss will know to use that template when monitoring those types of interfaces<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:30:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; once you've copied the template you want to go in to the newly created template and remove the datasources that it's complaining about<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:30:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; understand?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:30:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i believe so, yes.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:31:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; let me try...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:31:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; the easiest way to tell what it's complaining about is to click on the interface and look at the graphs<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:31:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; any graphs that aren't graphing properly tell you what it's having issues with<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:31:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you just go in and delete those specific datasources, thresholds, and graphs<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:32:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; and leave the rest<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:32:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; (obviously do that in the copy of the template renamed to match the type of the interface, not in the ethernetCsmacd template itself)<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:32:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; they all seem to be POTS peers on the router.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:33:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i had a few T1 cards in there earlier, but there's so many events now i can't find anything else.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:33:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; etank: what's .tm_wday and such?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:34:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; just a replacement for the numerical?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:34:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: fix what you can, then clear the events and wait for whatever's left to fix to come back<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:34:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:34:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; repeat until it's all fixed<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:35:24] &lt;etank&gt; rmatte: time.localtime().tm_wday == 6:&#160;&#160;&#160; &lt;-- should be Saturday<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:35:30] &lt;etank&gt; if i understand it correctly<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:36:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; k well, I don't personally see an issue with it<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:36:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; is the text turning red when you save it?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:36:16] &lt;etank&gt; rmatte: nope<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:36:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; then there's technically nothing wrong with it<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:47:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, any idea what these events mean? "localhost zenperfsnmp heartbeat failure"<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:47:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it keeps getting flagged on the server that zenoss is installed on...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:49:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; ever since 2.5.2 there are tons of those, just ignore them<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:49:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are overly sensitive now and are thus useless<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:49:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are supposed to alert you when one of the zenoss daemons has become unresponsive<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:50:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:50:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i removed what i thought were the offending OIDs from the data sources on my newly copied performance template<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:51:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but i'm still getting a ton of debug events.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:51:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you rename the copied template to exactly match the type of the interface?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:51:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; what did you rename the template to?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:51:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, you probably need to do manage -&gt; push changes<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:51:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well... that's the problem.&#160; i can't figure out the interface, and from the looks of it there's a ton of POTS line dial peers that it's flagging.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:52:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; what do you mean you can't figure out the interface?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:52:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; Voice Encapsulation (POTS) Peer: 20054<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:52:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that looks like the interface.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:52:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; literally go to one of the devices, click on the interface<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:52:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; on the os tab<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:52:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; after clicking on it, the type will be listed above the graphs<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:52:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what you need to rename the template to<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:53:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; don't name the template after the actual name of the interface, that's not going to accomplish anything<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:53:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; IpInterface?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:53:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; or&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;EFXS 50/0/1<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:53:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; does it say: type: IpInterface?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:53:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well, at the top it says IpInterface.&#160; Under type is "Other"<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:54:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; bingo<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:54:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; rename the template to Other<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:54:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh... ok.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:54:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/> lol<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:54:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:54:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lets try this again haha<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:54:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; repeat for each interface that you're seeing the issue with<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:55:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i think i know why it's spitting out all these debug messages as well.&#160; there's a TON of virtual interfaces on our routers for SRST mode.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:55:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; when the router is operating normally, the interfaces are down.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:56:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:57:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, even if the interfaces are down it should still be able to collector those values<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:57:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; collect*<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:57:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; weird.&#160; well i don't know then.&#160; it does seem to be flagging a lot of other interfaces as well now that i look at it.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:57:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; trying to pull up the event history now, this is probably a bad idea...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:58:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I doubt that "Other" is the only type that it's having issues with<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:58:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have like 20 custom interface templates<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:59:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ugh.&#160; i just am getting flooded with these bad OID debug events.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:59:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only way to get rid of them is as I described<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:59:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; you only have to do it once<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:59:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:59:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's a reason for those debug messages, why would you want to be polling snmp OIDs that don't exist?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:59:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; it just puts extra stress on Zenoss for no reason<br/>[08-Jun-2010 12:59:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i shouldn't be...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:00:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; cleaning all that up will improve your monitoring performance<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:00:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i didn't add any extraneous OIDs<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:00:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; like I said, Zenoss uses the ethernetCsmacd template for everything by default<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:00:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's like zenoss pulled them all at first, and now can't access them.&#160; that's what seems to be happening, i don't know.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:00:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; and some interfaces don't support that full set of OIDs<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:00:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:00:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's up to you to create templates for other interface types<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:01:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i see.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:02:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm slaughtering this server!<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:02:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:02:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; probably doesn't help that our old network monitoring system is also running on the same server...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:06:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; what are the specs on the server?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:07:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; 2gb of ram<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:07:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; how many devices are you monitoring?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:07:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; X5460&#160; @ 3.16GHz<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:07:30] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ~500 currently<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:07:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's extremely inadequate<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:07:58] &lt;jb&gt; well, the CPU is fine<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's inadequate if you have Zenoss running by itself, let alone alongside another system<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:02] &lt;jb&gt; buut yeah, you need more RAM <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; the CPU is fine<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; the RAM needs to be at least 4GB in there<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:30] &lt;jb&gt; RAM is cheap.. throw 8+ GB in it<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:30] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well, i'll have to talk to the old boss to see about increasing the RAM.&#160; i think it's a VM.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:36] &lt;jb&gt; ah<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; The system that I have monitoring 400 devices had 5GB of RAM in it<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, and i don't get to touch any of that stuff.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; has*<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:08:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:09:06] &lt;jb&gt; i have one with 900 devices with 16GB<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:09:10] &lt;jb&gt; and the other doing 300 with 32GB<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:09:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; how the heck are these guys monitoring 20,000 devices then?&#160; do they have 200 collectors?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:09:37] &lt;jb&gt; they have multiple collectors<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:09:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: it depends on what the devices are too<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:09:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well, i was thinking like 10.&#160; but based on those numbers, they would need like 200.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's probably 20,000 cable modems or something<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, all routers and switches.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; which only have a few OIDs to poll<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:10] &lt;jb&gt; nah, my boxes are nowhere -near- maxed out<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:16] &lt;jb&gt; the one with 32GB could probably handle 2000 devices<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i see.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you'd need a ton of collectors to monitor 20000 devices<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:36] &lt;jb&gt; and depending if you are using WMI or SNMP, etc<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; somehow i doubt they're going to give me that much <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/>&#160; i'll probably be lucky to get 4gb.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:41] &lt;jb&gt; all of that comes into play<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you're doing full snmp monitoring on them<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea fortunately i don't need to worry about wmi... yet.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:10:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: well, you can't make bricks without clay<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:11:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and full SNMP monitoring is nice, but not a requirement.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:11:18] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, tell the big wigs that...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:11:28] &lt;jb&gt; you tell them <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:11:31] &lt;jb&gt; they are your bosses <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:11:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; they don't know what the heck they want.&#160; they want me to test a system, but don't give me any resources to do so.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:11:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: I would tell them that<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:11:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; now they're telling me that i shouldn't be installing anything yet, and that i need to get requirements for.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:12:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: If they don't listen, then fine, it's their problem at that point<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:12:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; which, i've already done that leg work.&#160; which is why i installed zenoss.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:12:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, it's fun.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:12:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; there are 2 types of managers, ones that are hard to win over and ones that are just plain unreasonable<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:12:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i know.&#160; we'll see what they say today.&#160; i gave them the requirements.&#160; we shall see where they go from here.&#160; they felt like i was throwing in zenoss as a solution that would only work for our department, which is completely untrue.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:13:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss will work for anything<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:13:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; you just need the resources<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:13:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol yea<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:13:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i know.&#160; it's very scalable, and while i can start with just our stuff the other departments will be able to use it as well.. assuming they give the capacity.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:14:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, my manager had a brain fart and changed the IP of one of my lab boxes to the same IP as one of our dns servers, lovely, so now I have to fix it lol<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:14:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nice.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:14:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's using ldap authentication too, so I'm having issues even getting in to it<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:14:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that sounds... awesome lol.&#160; hopefully there's a way to locally auth!<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:15:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, single user mode if worst comes to worst<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:15:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; or a linux livecd<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:15:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:26:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well so far so good after a reboot of the server.&#160; haven't been flooded with those debug events any longer.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:33:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damnit, spoke too soon.&#160; but i think i see why...<br/>[08-Jun-2010 13:43:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll get flooded by them until you either unmanage those interfaces or do what I said with the templates<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:04:09] mrayzenoss is now known as mray<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:20:34] &lt;nzle&gt; I have a program on a monitored system that simply returns 1 or 0 error condition.&#160;&#160; I need to integrate it into<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:21:07] &lt;nzle&gt; my zenoss monitoring.&#160; can someone referm me to an example of how to configure zenoss to ssh to the box and run it<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:23:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, what do you mean 'unmanage the interfaces'?&#160; is there an easy way to do that?&#160; just got back from lunch, and even with these new templates i still have 6600+ debug events.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:23:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nzle, you can configure a template to do that.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:26:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: I meant set them to unmonitored<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:27:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, perhaps that would be a better option... these voice encapsulation dial peers i really could care less about.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:27:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you need to have them monitored then create the custom template, otherwise just set them to not be monitored<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:27:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; do i have to set each individual interface on each device to not be monitored?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:27:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can also add them to the list of ignored interface names in zProperties<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:27:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, you do<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:27:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that sounds like a much easier method.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:27:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; cuz there's like 50 interfaces per device i think<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:28:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; Devices -&gt; zProperties -&gt; zInterfaceMapIgnoreNames<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:28:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have mine as: ^(Voice Encapsulation|Voice Over IP Peer|Foreign Exchange Station)<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:28:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; what about types?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:28:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; zInterfaceMapIgnoreTypes?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:28:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; don't bother with the map ignore types<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:28:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:29:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; just leave it as is<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:29:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; then save &amp; push changes i assume?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:29:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; save and remodel all those devices<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:30:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i guess that would be my next question, i see how to remodel individual devices, but how do i remodel all devices?&#160; or a portion of devices?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:33:27] &lt;mray&gt; FYI, bigegor updated a bunch of his ZenPacks recently<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:33:42] &lt;mray&gt;

in the template, the Command Template field is '/rxHubExpress/rxHubExpressPing'&#160; which if cut an pasted to the system to be monitored, logged in as the user in the zproperties, run properly.<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:43:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that doesn't seem right... can you take a screenshot of your template?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:43:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, so is there anyway to remodel all my devices in a bulk fashion?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 14:43:21] &lt;rmatte&gt;

the test obviously isn't working properly<br/>[08-Jun-2010 15:34:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe if you put /bin/sh before the command in the test template?<br/>[08-Jun-2010 15:34:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think that's what the bug was, that it didn't do that, I could be wrong<br/>[08-Jun-2010 15:35:20] &lt;rmatte&gt;

What would cause zenoss to suddenly stop graphing ?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 11:58:26] &lt;mray&gt; smbambling: docs/DOC-2510 is the doc most people use<br/>[09-Jun-2010 11:58:38] &lt;mray&gt; gordy: file system full?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 11:58:51] &lt;gordy&gt;

GREAT!<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:00:14] &lt;mray&gt; gordy: are all graphs stopped?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:00:24] &lt;mray&gt; different graphs get their data from different daemons<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:00:43] &lt;mray&gt; is zenperfsnmp and zencommand for snmp &amp; ssh<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:01:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea.... doing a custom modeler is a little over my head right now.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:01:09] &lt;mray&gt; gordy: also, the devices could be in a maintenance window of decommissioned<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:01:32] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: it's really just pointing OIDs into dictionaries<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:01:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; gordy: are you getting SNMP Agent down events for the devices at all?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:01:43] &lt;mray&gt; but it requires a little Python<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:01:43] &lt;gordy&gt; hmm,&#160; my first google search led to a zenoss forums page that suggested to delete all rrd files<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:01:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm going thru the source of the sunmibmonitor, i'm pretty lost.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:02:13] &lt;gordy&gt; will deleting the rrd files be ill advised ?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:02:26] &lt;mray&gt; gordy: you'll lose all historical performance data<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:02:33] &lt;gordy&gt; crap<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:03:01] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: the only files that matter are the ZenPacks/community/SunMIBMonitor/__init__.py<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:03:15] &lt;mray&gt; the ZenPacks/community/SunMIBMonitor/modeler/snmp/*<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:03:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

arrrghhh: you can take that zenpack and delete the daemons, datasources, lib, migrate, services, skins directories<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:05:06] &lt;mray&gt; and apparently tests, since there aren't any<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:05:17] &lt;mray&gt; all you need is that empty objects.xml and a modeler<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:06:07] &lt;mray&gt; the SUNProcessMap.py uses a custom collector, but that seems like overkill<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:06:56] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: something like http://zenpacks.zenoss.org/trac-zenpacks/browser/zenpacks/ZenPacks.AndreaConsadori.Alvarion/ZenPacks/AndreaConsadori/Alvarion/modeler/plugins/AlvarionDeviceMap.py is a little more straightforward<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:07:28] &lt;mray&gt; just add a new snmpGetMap to point at the OID, then in process you set the location<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:08:10] &lt;mray&gt; I might write it myself if I ever finish up with Cfengine and Chef<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:08:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok, that's making more sense.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:08:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; the process section, i'm not exactly clear on how to set the location tho.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:08:41] &lt;mray&gt; wasn't there a forum thread for this?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:08:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

hoping the bump will get it noticed...<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:14:36] &lt;mray&gt; ok, putting this together<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:14:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; you're awesome <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:18:07] &lt;jro&gt;

I'll read the debug output a bit more<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:19:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4_: otherwise the auth log on the server would be flooded<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:19:10] &lt;Simon4_&gt; wondering if it's because I only have one device loaded and it's just opening a bunch because it can<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:19:31] &lt;jro&gt; 2.5.70 has been running real smooth, it took a bit to get used to the new layout but now that i've found everything its great<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:19:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; It should only be opening 1 per device, if it's opening more that's just plain dumb<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:19:43] &lt;Simon4_&gt; rmatte: yeah, that was my thought<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:19:48] * Simon4_ goes to read the logs more<br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:20:33] &lt;jro&gt; alot smoother than the pervious release candidates <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[09-Jun-2010 12:20:44] &lt;mray&gt;

whats the reccomended method, stack or system rpms?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:24:21] &lt;nickanderson&gt; ive done both in the past<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:24:40] &lt;nickanderson&gt; but ran into issues trying too hook to ldap when using the stack installer<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:24:44] &lt;Simon4_&gt; I run system rpms because we have dbas etc who look after the mysql side<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:25:51] &lt;smbambling&gt; so it looks like zenoss has its own packaged python under /opt/zenoss/lib/python<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:26:05] &lt;smbambling&gt; how do I go about installing python-ldap for that<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:26:05] &lt;nickanderson&gt; mysql is a oneoff for us either way<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:27:32] &lt;Simon4_&gt; smbambling: you may need to go down the stack installer instructions route then<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:28:00] &lt;Simon4_&gt; just remember to switch pathnames out as appropriate<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:28:03] &lt;smbambling&gt; odd I installed zenoss from the native rpms.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:30:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; even the native rpms have their own python<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:30:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what I thought<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:30:50] &lt;Simon4_&gt; yeah, the redhat ones do<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:31:55] &lt;Simon4_&gt; smbambling: you migtt be able to get away with just the ln -s commands to be honest<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:32:10] &lt;smbambling&gt; just making some symlinks<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:32:58] &lt;smbambling&gt; worth a shot<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:33:15] forsberg is now known as fOrsberg<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:40:12] &lt;smbambling&gt; WOOT!

does anyone know why the uptime would always say unknown on a remote collector?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:56:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; ptom: the uptime for devices you mean?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:56:33] &lt;ptom&gt; correct<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:56:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're sure you have the uptime datapoint in one of the templates applied to the devices?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:56:48] &lt;ptom&gt; i have checked the rrd files and they all seem fine<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:57:02] &lt;ptom&gt; yes<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:57:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it's called sysUpTime?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:57:30] &lt;ptom&gt; yep<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:57:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:57:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure then<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:57:45] &lt;ptom&gt; me either, banging my head against a wall<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:58:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; could be a bug<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:58:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're using core I assume?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:58:38] &lt;ptom&gt; yeah, an old version. not a huge deal. we are upgrading soon.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:59:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; remote collectors aren't really "officially supported" in core.&#160; the whole remote collector setup has been in use more lately because of the Collector Tool and Data Collector ZenPacks being released<br/>[09-Jun-2010 14:59:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; There could be bugs in the code, or there may be errors in the way we're doing things when configuring core to use collectors<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:00:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've only tested it briefly in the past, but that's one thing I never checked<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:01:05] &lt;ptom&gt; the wierd thing is, one of the collecters displays this correctly, but it's a diff flavor of linux<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:02:00] &lt;ptom&gt; not a big deal, I just figured I would ask and see if anyone knew<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:04:50] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: I had to go run a few errands, still debugging that ZenPack<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:09:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; LOL, one of our server engineers and his director were yelling back and forth jokingly about this trip that they are going to be taking to see a client.&#160; The director said "Don't forget, we'll be sharing a hotel room." then a few people out here started doing the wolf whistle to which the director followed up asking the engineer "Do you prefer the flavoured kind or the kind that heats up?"<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:10:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/> it feels like a Friday today<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:12:27] &lt;gordy&gt; Why is it that " zenperfsnmp run -v10 -d &lt;hostname&gt; &gt; foo" OR "&#160; zenperfsnmp run -v10 -d &lt;hostname&gt; |grep ERROR " does not work ?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:12:44] &lt;Simon4_&gt; it might be logging to stderr<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:12:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; python is very tricky when piping or redirecting<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:12:57] &lt;Simon4_&gt; try zenperfsnmp run -v10 -d &lt;hostname&gt; 2&gt;&amp;1 |grep ERROR<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:12:59] &lt;gordy&gt; lovely<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:13:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4_: nah, I find that it doesn't actually pipe output until it's completely done executing in most cases<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:13:33] &lt;gordy&gt; ahhhh much better<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:13:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; and if it forks off it doesn't pipe at all<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:13:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, so it was writing to stderr?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:14:28] * Simon4_ is pretty sure it does<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:14:39] &lt;gordy&gt; running " zenperfsnmp run -v10 -d &lt;hostname&gt; |grep ERROR " outputs as " zenperfsnmp run -v10 -d &lt;hostname&gt; "<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:14:47] &lt;Simon4_&gt; yeah ,it does<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:15:04] &lt;Simon4_&gt; hmm<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:15:06] &lt;Simon4_&gt; or<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:15:30] &lt;gordy&gt; the " 2&gt;&amp;1&#160; " makes it work one normally thinks it does<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:16:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, 2&gt;&amp;1 is basically stderr &gt; stdout<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:16:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; since the grep gets applied against stdout<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:17:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; and python writes to stderr<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:17:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is kind of funky<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:17:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; it might be done that way with the daemons for logging purposes<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:17:44] &lt;mray&gt; my solution&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; always use emacs as my shell<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:17:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; bash ftw!<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:17:58] &lt;Simon4_&gt; mray: you're a scary man<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:18:10] &lt;Simon4_&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:18:14] &lt;mray&gt; seriously, it's awesome<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:18:28] &lt;mray&gt; you can search everything that has ever come out of your shell<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:18:47] &lt;mray&gt; my current buffer&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;

though the searching is nice<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:20:14] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: but can you Ctrl-R and search the buffer?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:20:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's an interesting idea, might give it a whirl sometime<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:20:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: no, I can't, the search would have to be in the client as well<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:20:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; but I love bash too much to do away with it<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:21:05] &lt;nickanderson&gt; what no one using ipython as their shell?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:21:06] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: it's still bash, it's just wrapped in a searchable text editor<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:21:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:21:22] &lt;mray&gt;

arrrghhh: he's talking about checking the collector plugins list<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:36:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; Devices from the left hand menu, then from the dropdown: More -&gt; Collector Plugins<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:37:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

no, it does not show up in my collector plugins.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:37:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, he probably needs to fix the pack then<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:37:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i was going to flail around for a little bit and then ask <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/>&#160; i usually learn better if i poke around myself first.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:37:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:38:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; I respect that<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:38:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm getting more and more comfortable with the interface tho<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:38:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; some people come in here and rhyme off question after question after question until finally I'm like "Please read the Zenoss admin guide located &lt;here&gt;"<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:38:54] &lt;rmatte&gt;

yeh, that's an awesome site<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:42:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I did that to one of my friends and he replied "OMG I feel dumb!&#160; How could you do this to me!?"<br/>[09-Jun-2010 15:42:36] &lt;rmatte&gt;

but i try not to ask simple questions that are clearly in the admin guide <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:30:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:30:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok wtf, my cubicle is like a jungle today, first I had these tiny red bugs running around everywhere, then some other weird beatles, now I have a lady bug in here<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:31:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ...is your cube outdoors?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:31:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol, nope<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:32:00] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn,<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:32:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; our bugs have to get thru security to get in the building <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:32:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:33:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so for zInterfaceMapIgnoreNames, I separate the values with a pipe (|)?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:36:18] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so would this be vaild? "Voice Encapsulation|Foreign Exchange Office|Foreign Exchange Station|ATM Sub Interface|Voice Over IP Peer"?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:36:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it's generally defined like: ^(Voice Encapsulation|Foreign Exchange Office|Foreign Exchange Station|ATM Sub Interface|Voice Over IP Peer)<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:37:04] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so the carat and parens are required?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:37:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; what the ^ does is tells it to ignore if the interface name starts with that string<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:37:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; regex formatting<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:37:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah i see<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:37:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; alright i'm going to save this and remodel one device, see if it makes a difference.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:37:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have mine defined as: ^(Voice Encapsulation|Voice Over IP Peer|Foreign Exchange Station)<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:38:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; which means anything starting with any of those strings in the name is ignored<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:38:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, all my DSL routers were reporting a ton of ATM interfaces as debug events as well.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:38:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; see, to me that's redundant.&#160; that field is for ignoring devices, why would i structure a regex statement to ignore the ignored devices?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:38:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, for those you might have to setup the custom templates as I had explained and remove the offending datasources<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:39:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; hunh?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:39:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i was having issues with that.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:39:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; What do you mean for ignoring devices?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:39:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's for ignoring interfaces<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:39:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; when modelling<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:40:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; so If I specify ^(Voice Encapsulation|Voice Over IP Peer|Foreign Exchange Station) as the regex, and I add or remodel a device that has interfaces starting with Voice Encapsulation and Voice Over IP Peer it won't add them to the interfaces list<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:40:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll just completely ignore them<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:41:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the purpose of zInterfaceMapIgnoreNames<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:42:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i get that.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:42:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; Now, if you want the interfaces to be in the list, but you're seeing debug messages for them, you need to determine the type of the interfaces, copy ethernetCsmacd to that type, then edit it to remove the OIDs that it's having issues with<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:42:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but the field is titled "IgnoreNames"<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:42:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and you're structuring a regex statement to ignore<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:42:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; kinda redundant...<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:42:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i'm torn on that<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:42:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, that's just the way that particular field works<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:43:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; not sure if i should be doing templates for that or if i should just ignore the messages.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:43:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do templates, it's not that hard to do<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:43:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; takes about a minute to do 1<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:44:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i just couldn't get the hang of it.&#160; do i need to remodel after i create a template?&#160; maybe that was my problem.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:44:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, you dodn't<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:44:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; don't*<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:44:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:44:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well... maybe i'll give it another shot when it's done remodeling this device.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:44:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; you just create the template, and as long as the name exactly matches the type listed for the interfaces (case sensitive) Zenoss will know to use it<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:44:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; now is it the exact name of the interface or of the type of interface?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:44:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; the type<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:45:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; remember how you had an interface with a type of "Other"?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:45:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; cuz we found a lot of those types were 'other'...<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:45:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what the template needs to be called<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:45:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yes <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/>&#160; i do.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:45:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's case sensitive too<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:45:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; so "other" won't cut it<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:45:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; wouldn't that hit ALL devices that are type 'other'?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:45:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; it needs to be "Other"<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:45:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, All interfaces that are type Other<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:45:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; sorry, i meant all interfaces.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:45:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; it has nothing to do with devices, it's an interface template<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:46:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, it will<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:46:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:46:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; in my Other template I just removed the error datapoints, threshold, and graph<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:48:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so in the data sources, i just find the part of the OID that's causing the issue and remove that data source?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:49:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2mg8fon&amp;s=6<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:49:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's the screenshot of my other template<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:49:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; compare it to the ethernetCsmacd template and you'll see what I changed<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:49:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; and yes, that's correct<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:50:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you remove the threshold and graph associated with those datasources as well<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:50:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll be pairs of datasources, it's generally the error datasources<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:50:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; but sometimes it's all of them<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:50:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; depends on the interface<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:50:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a few that are just blank templates since the interface types don't support any of them<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:51:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; huh.&#160; and you don't have to add any?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:51:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; Those are the standard SNMP interface OIDs<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:51:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; If an interface type doesn't support them, there's really nothing else to add<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:52:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, and the operational status threshold and ifOperStatus in that screenshot are things that I added to do interface status monitoring<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:52:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; Which is explained here: docs/DOC-2494<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:52:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i see<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:55:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; http://i48.tinypic.com/ff2v11.jpg<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:55:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's my list of templates under /Devices<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:55:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; holy crap<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:55:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; couple more than i have haha<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:55:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I added them as I went along<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:55:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've got pretty much everything I need now<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:56:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; those are all types<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:56:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; so some interfaces have type aal5, atm, ds1, ds3, frame-relay, and so on<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:56:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; crazy<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:56:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:56:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i saw some aal5 debug messages<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:57:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, then you'll probably be adding that yourself<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:58:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; Understand a bit better now?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:58:44] &lt;sytem&gt; hmmm, zenhub is again filling /tmp with deleted, but still open files<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:58:56] &lt;sytem&gt; time to weekly reboot zenoss<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:58:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; sytem: odd<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:59:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; sytem: what version of Zenoss?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:59:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, yea, it's slowly making sense.&#160; i guess a curiousity question, where do the events go now or are the devices being 'properly' monitored with these templates?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 16:59:29] &lt;sytem&gt; 2.5.2, same issue was with 2.4<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:00:49] &lt;sytem&gt; COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:00:50] &lt;sytem&gt; .python.b 18816 zenoss 5u REG 0,20 2359296000 82675856 /tmp/tmpHaP_FR (deleted)<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:01:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: once the templates are in place it won't be trying to poll the unavailable OIDs anymore, hence the debug messages won't be generated at all<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:01:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh... i see.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:01:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: the only reason you're seeing those messages is because Zenoss is trying to poll OIDs that don't exist for those interfaces<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:02:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; der, i knew that.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:02:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; Which is why you need to make the templates to tell it not to<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:02:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:02:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; you told me that yesterday... there's still a lot i have to learn about SNMP, let alone zenoss!<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:02:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; sytem: that's really weird<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:02:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; sytem: I've never seen that before<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:03:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, SNMP isn't super complex, but there is stuff to learn<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:03:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; would "ATT DS0 Point (64 Kbps)" be a vaild type?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:03:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it is<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:03:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i have that for a bunch of my voice routers<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:03:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol i just looked at yours and i see it in there.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:03:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:03:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; as long as it's listed under type it's good<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:04:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; the interface names themselves won't work<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:04:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; has to be type<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:04:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ugh, i think i need to go home.&#160; gettin tired, not cross-referencing stuff.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:04:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:04:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; It took me a long time to figure out the interface template stuff, but it works quite well<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:05:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; there is the odd issue where 2 interfaces of the same type won't support the same OIDs<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:05:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's fairly rare<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:06:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, looks like a lot of your templates are setup based on cisco devices just like mine...<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:06:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; for example, frame-relay, the physical serial interface supports the whole set of OIDs, but the virtual sub-interface does not support the error OIDs<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:06:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; but they are both type frame-relay<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:06:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; in those cases I generally just make a local copy of the template under the sub interface and remove the OIDs that need to be removed<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:06:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not ideal but it works<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:07:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; It would be nice to be able to define templates based on interface names as well, but I doubt that'll happen any time soon<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:08:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i'm not sure if this is the _best_ solution for our environment... but it seems configurable enough that we can make it work.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:08:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; and yes, I monitor a lot of Cisco stuff<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:08:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; I love cisco gear since Cisco does SNMP properly<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:09:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; some other manufacturer's SNMP implementations are absolute nightmares<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:09:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, they're pretty good about following standards...<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:09:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's like the developers got drunk as skunks the day they wrote the SNMP portion of the OS for the devices<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:09:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:09:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; HP Fiber Switches are a good example of that<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:10:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; we have a bunch of force10 switches for the SAN... but other than that it's pretty much all Cisco.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:10:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; Instead of providing the actual numbered interface name, every interface is "Copper Ethernet (10/100)"<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:10:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:10:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nice, that must be maddening.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:10:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; Like, wtf were they thinking?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:10:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:10:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; we don't do SNMP on our switches... which makes my life so much easier.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:11:08] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:11:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I can imagine<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:11:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do lots of SNMP monitoring on switches, but the majority are cisco and HP<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:11:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; the standard HP switches are fine<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:11:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; The fiber/blade switches are garbage<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:12:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; thats... odd.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:12:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:12:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; companies just get too large<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:12:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:12:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:12:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; they can't manage all the crap they're churning out.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:13:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:13:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; consistency goes out the window to push out new products.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:13:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; because it would take too long for them to try and make everything consistent.&#160; i'm sure that's the attitude.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:13:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; too many different teams as well, the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:13:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that, and cisco changes things up frequently to ensure their engineers are paid well.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:13:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; seriously.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:13:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; Cisco is just pure quality, through and through<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:14:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't really know why you'd bother going with anything else<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:14:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i do like their network hardware<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:14:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i have my reservations about callmanager/unity tho<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:14:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; They do have their odd IOS bugs and whatnot, but they get fixed quickly<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:14:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha, we're just starting callmanager and unity monitoring<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:14:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; cisco just acquiring products and trying to force them all to work nicely together...<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:14:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; I personally want nothing to do with it<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:14:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i have to manage it.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:15:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; Our company just got Cisco UC certified<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:15:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i wear many hats, this zenoss hat that i just recently put on was literally dumped on me when our old NMIS monitoring system blew up.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:15:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; so we have engineers that do all that fun stuff<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:15:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nice<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:15:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:15:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm basically "The Zenoss guy" around here<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:15:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; but there's enough to keep me busy<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:15:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nice.&#160; not surprising tho haha.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:16:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; I also manage our ticketing system and our config backup system<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:16:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; along with the Zenoss servers themselves<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:16:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; The day I leave people will cry<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:16:36] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: we should get you enough t-shirts for every day, so you can dress the part<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:16:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea i have to handle all our WAN links, voice call routing, voicemail, ip phones, old nortel phones...<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:16:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; haha<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:16:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: Funny you should say that, I have a Zenoss t-shirt on right now<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:16:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; speaking of t-shirts...<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:17:00] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nice<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:17:07] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: don't ask<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:17:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; So they went the way of the dinosaurs?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:17:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:17:33] &lt;mray&gt; we've fired 2 t-shirt companies<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:17:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:17:46] &lt;mray&gt; I just hope there are some at SELF this weekeend<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:18:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; alrighty, i've had my fill.&#160; i may pop back in if i feel like punishing myself some more <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/>&#160; thanks for all the help guys, i'm sure i'll be back!<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:18:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, t-shirt companies aren't very scarce in general<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:18:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: my pleasure, cheers<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:18:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm sure you'll find something<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:18:54] &lt;mray&gt; grrr.. time to throw out this VM<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:19:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; broken?<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:19:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, I just noticed the time, have a poker game to get to<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:19:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; cya tomorrow<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:20:09] &lt;mray&gt; later<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:20:28] &lt;mray&gt; just noticed I'd accidentally created 10 snapshots of my VM&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; I guess that's handy<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:20:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:20:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but it bogs down performance badly<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:20:50] &lt;mray&gt; yeah, I'll delete them<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:20:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; because it has to maintain states between all of them<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:20:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:21:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, me, door, bye<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:21:18] &lt;merlincorey&gt; is there a way<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:22:57] &lt;merlincorey&gt; well there is one, but what is the way, to add additions to the community zenpacks?&#160; specifically, I have an nginx performance template using a COMMAND and a little python script that I made, and I noticed there is nothing on the community site and the only offsite thing I could find is not very complete<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:23:17] &lt;merlincorey&gt; (which is why I made it)<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:23:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; package it as a ZenPack and submit it to mray<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:23:38] &lt;mray&gt; merlincorey: that's my job<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:23:42] &lt;merlincorey&gt; excellent<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:23:45] &lt;cgibbons&gt; with beer included<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:23:50] &lt;merlincorey&gt; but I want my beer <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:24:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; cgibbons: I like your style<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:24:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; cd /pub &amp;&amp; more beer<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:24:44] &lt;cgibbons&gt; i am hoping to drink massive quantities of the substance next week. for me that probably means 4.<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:24:46] &lt;merlincorey&gt; ok well then I guess the next thing after I get it working on freebsd will be to make zenpacks<br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:24:52] &lt;merlincorey&gt; thanks for the information <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[09-Jun-2010 17:25:19] &lt;mray&gt;

Jimbosyn, this is the place to ask any question<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:08:03] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; I'm currently using our Exchange SMTP server to send email alerts, but it occurred to me that we won't get alerted if Exchange goes down.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:08:15] &lt;themactech&gt; consider the zenoss folks here like your priests, you must confess all your snmp sins to them<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:08:57] &lt;themactech&gt; I have my emails sent out via the zenoss machine itslef<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:09:11] &lt;themactech&gt; and I send it to two different servers for redundancy<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:09:41] &lt;themactech&gt; I get the alerts via my company email and my personnal email, so if one goes down i still get the alerts<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:10:07] &lt;themactech&gt; I will setup a heartbeat system on a machine to be setup in our lab at the office (I will get the machine in 5 days)<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:10:30] &lt;themactech&gt; all our off-site zenoss monitoring machines will send an email to it every 5 mins<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:10:45] &lt;themactech&gt; if we dont get the email for 15 mins an alert will go up<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:11:26] &lt;themactech&gt; telling us something is wrong with the zenoss server at that location<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:12:28] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; themactech: how do you send to two email addressess?&#160; Do you have two users set up, or can you seperate the email addresses with a comma?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:12:52] &lt;themactech&gt; i dont recall how i did that, let me vpn to a site and check<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:14:15] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; themactech: so the best practice would be to use a local smtp server instead of the corporate server.&#160; That's kinda what I was thinking, but was not sure what others were doing<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:14:44] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; themactech: Are you using sendmail?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:14:51] &lt;themactech&gt; I am using two users<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:15:00] &lt;themactech&gt; dont know if two emails can be put into one user<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:15:09] &lt;themactech&gt; the server used is not the issue<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:15:21] &lt;themactech&gt; you need a system to notify you if the email server fails<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:15:35] &lt;themactech&gt; easy way I think is to have a cron job send email every 5 mins<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:15:45] &lt;themactech&gt; and a cron job on the receiving end<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:15:45] &lt;themactech&gt; &Atilde;&sect;<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:16:05] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; That is a great idea<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:16:05] &lt;themactech&gt; everytime the receiver gets the heartbeat email, he touches a file<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:16:24] &lt;themactech&gt; so you threshold the file's modified date<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:16:30] &lt;themactech&gt; if it gets older than 15 mins<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:16:31] &lt;themactech&gt; alert<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:18:36] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; Ah I see<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:19:33] &lt;themactech&gt; you can use any old pc to be your heartbeat monitor<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:19:58] &lt;themactech&gt; it just read the email account you use for that heartbeat and touches any dumb text file you make for this purpose<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:21:07] &lt;themactech&gt; I am getting a Dell PowerEdge to set this up in our lab next week, been waiting for months for us to get that machine<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:21:19] &lt;themactech&gt;

at one site I had to configure it to go thru their corporate relay, so that adds a point of failure<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:23:10] &lt;themactech&gt; but again the point of failure is irrelevant if you can detect that there is a failure, then you vpn in (if needed) and diagnose<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:23:40] &lt;themactech&gt; the problem you want to avoid is to go on for 3 weeks thinking all is well because you haven't received any emails and the whole thing is down<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:26:22] &lt;themactech&gt; Hey Matt, any chance you could convince Egor to come down to your next community day and do a training session on the advanceddevice zenpack?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:26:48] &lt;mray&gt; themactech: well&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; he's in Germany<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:27:01] &lt;themactech&gt; ok, that makes it somewhat difficult<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:27:27] &lt;themactech&gt; But there is videoconferencing, hmmm....<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:28:18] &lt;themactech&gt; I was thinking you should offer 2 sessions at your community day, the obvious 'intro to zenoss' for newcomers, but maybe a second session for folks already using it<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:28:34] &lt;themactech&gt; maybe the content of session 2 could be decided upon by the participants<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:28:43] &lt;themactech&gt; would get more repeat visitors this way<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:29:36] &lt;themactech&gt; I know it would be easier for me to get approval to attend from the powers that be if the content would be more in depth<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:32:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; themactech: the problem with doing more advanced training is that attendance probably wouldn't be that great<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:32:29] &lt;themactech&gt; really?&#160; last time most of the folks in the room were already deploying zenoss<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:32:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; more advanced training would be something to do as regular scheduled workshops where a trainer takes on small groups of people for a fee<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:32:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, but it's a big step between deploying Zenoss (knowing how to add devices and such), and actual development<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:33:35] &lt;themactech&gt; training could be done by attendees, everyone could present something they came up with too<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:33:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, assuming people actually bring something to show<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:34:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; They could do it as a side thing maybe<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:34:58] &lt;themactech&gt; its just that I don't see how I will get approval to attend again if its just the 'intro to zenoss', and last time there was some folks with good ideas in the room<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:35:14] &lt;themactech&gt;

and the art of doing so seems more like a dark ritual to me right now<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:41:41] &lt;ptmcg&gt; @themactech - when you say "advanced" are you thinking mostly "advanced ZenPack development"?&#160; I am still new here, but I'm learning that there is so much breadth to this system that you can go "advanced" in about 20 different directions<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:42:05] &lt;themactech&gt; well zenoss is wide open, that is a big strength<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:42:25] &lt;themactech&gt;

granted I am just picking up python<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:43:01] &lt;themactech&gt; maybe a python guru would pick this up in a heartbeat<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:43:22] &lt;ptmcg&gt; I'm just thinking that some kind of BoF session on "advanced topics" could be a pretty wild mix<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:43:29] &lt;themactech&gt; python is very modular, but the importing of libraries makes hunting down the actual code you want somewhat difficult<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:43:46] &lt;themactech&gt; you sometimes have to reference 6-7 layers to find what you need<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:44:13] &lt;themactech&gt; one script import from one, that imports from one, and so on and so on, so the actual code you need to get to is nested way deep<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:44:16] &lt;themactech&gt; its like a web<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:45:02] &lt;themactech&gt; thats why I mention that Egor's zenpack is key as it seems to unlock pandora's box to add custom hardware components, which I think is what most folks will need to do<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:45:14] &lt;themactech&gt; but documentation on it is non-existent<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:45:33] &lt;ptmcg&gt; I'm not familiar with it - is it done primarily in Python code?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:45:40] &lt;themactech&gt; all zenoss is python<br/>[10-Jun-2010 10:45:57] &lt;themactech&gt;

yea, i've been clearing them by hand<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:25:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; new ones keep popping up.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:25:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'll try the push changes<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:25:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; ummm, are you sure about that?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:25:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have Voice Encapsulation<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:25:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; the timestamp is from 3 minutes ago<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:25:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; as my template<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:25:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i saw that<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:25:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but when i look at the 'type' on mine<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:26:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's 'Voice Encapulation'<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:26:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; strange<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:26:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; look at your Voice Over IP one<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:26:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that's misspelled on yours.&#160; mine as well.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:26:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah yeh<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:26:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it is<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:26:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; weird<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:26:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm copying the type verbatim.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:26:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; copy/paste, gotta be sure.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:26:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:27:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; the name is Voice Encapsulation (POTS) Peer, but the type is Voice Encapulation<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:27:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; for this particular one<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:28:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so i don't have to bind these templates to anything, the name does it all?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:35:00] &lt;MWT&gt; *nudge* Is there any documentation on how to setup email alerts for specific devices/groups rather then the ALL devices?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:40:04] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; MWT, what version are you running?&#160; You should be able to do it thru the ZenUsers interface...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:41:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; click on the user &amp; go to 'alerting rules'<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:43:59] &lt;MWT&gt; Thank you kindly<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:45:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; sort it out then? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:46:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, i guess i'll take some screenshots here... i'm not sure what's wrong.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:49:32] &lt;MWT&gt; aaarghhh im running 2.5 and attempting to use the zenusers interface<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:49:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and...?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:49:59] &lt;MWT&gt; i see options to setup emails for groups, but not the option to disable emails for groups/devices<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:50:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; you use the filter<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:51:26] &lt;MWT&gt; ok, trying now. thanks again!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:51:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 12:53:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, so it says "OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20.13 is bad".&#160; If I go to the device, drill down to the template the only one that shows is the one I created, and the ONLY thing that remains in that template is the data source for OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8... what am I missing?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:02:05] mrayzenoss is now known as mray<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:02:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; That OID is ifOutErrors<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:02:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you sure that's not just some old debug message that you haven't cleared?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:03:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; let me try to clear everything out again<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:03:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i was getting new errors, but there's also a lot of old ones<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:04:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well, now that i look at it.&#160; the 'last seen' has been updated to a few minutes ago.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:07:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; just got a ton of new ones on the atm interfaces as well... grrrr<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:09:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, maybe restarting Zenoss would help, since it'll force the collector to pick up the changes<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:09:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm going to clear everything out &amp; go to lunch.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:09:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; since it doesn't appear to be for whatever reason<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:09:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that sounds like a good idea as well<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:10:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you did create the template right at /Devices right?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:10:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yes.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:10:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:10:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and i think you proved that piece is correct since the template appeared when i click on the interface and drill down into templates... correct?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:10:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; another thing is, you said you pasted the type in...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:10:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yessir<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:10:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you make sure there were no leading or trailing spaces in the name?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:11:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i actuallly screwed one up with a tab beginning in it and zenoss threw an error.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:11:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:11:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; plus, why would the template appear when i drill into the interface?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:11:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll throw errors for tabs, but not for spaces<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:11:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:11:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh true<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:11:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'll double check that<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:11:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it's appearing when you drill in then it should be working<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:11:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; exactly<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:11:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd say restart zenoss and see if that makes the debug messages stop coming in<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:12:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so do i still need to clear all these events or will the reboot clear them out?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:12:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll still need to clear them<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:12:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:12:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; so restart then use zendmd to clear them<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:12:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k i'll bbl<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:12:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; thanks rmatte<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:12:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:21:00] mrayzenoss is now known as mray<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:47:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mray, don't mean to bug ya but did you make any progress on that modeler?&#160; i can certainly do some more testing if you need me to <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:48:14] * mray sighs<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:52:21] &lt;mray&gt; so the modeler doesn't actually have a Device proper yet, so it can't access dmd and push the device to a Location<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:53:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; eugh, I wish the event count would increase on debug events<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:53:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; It would make the transform that I'm writing much easier<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:54:54] &lt;bigegor&gt; hi all, it looks like in zenoss 3.0 only CPU as device component supporte. What about support for HardDisks, Funs, TemperatureSensors?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:55:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I was wondering that myself<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:55:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; I only saw interfaces<br/>[10-Jun-2010 13:56:16] &lt;bigegor&gt;

rmatte, so i have a lot less debug events... perhaps that is a sign of progress.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:07:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so the server has been rebooting, i'm now clearing out the events... let's see what happens.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:08:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:09:27] &lt;mray&gt; bigegor: By request of arrrghhh yesterday, I started up on this ZenPack: http://zenpacks.zenoss.org/trac-zenpacks/browser/zenpacks/ZenPacks.community.SNMPLocation<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:10:00] &lt;mray&gt; it models the sysLocation OID and eventually will push the Device into that /Location<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:10:45] &lt;mray&gt; I was going to monkeypatch Device to access zendmd, but the zenpack doesn't even have a Device<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:11:03] &lt;mray&gt; so I'll probably make a zendmd call from the CLI cause I'm lazy<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:11:48] &lt;mray&gt; but I did test the monkeypatch idea over on my Cfengine ZenPack:<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:12:07] &lt;mray&gt; http://zenpacks.zenoss.org/trac-zenpacks/browser/zenpacks/ZenPacks.community.Cfengine/ZenPacks/community/Cfengine/CfengineClient.py calls setCfengineClient, which is referenced in the modeler<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:12:13] &lt;mray&gt; cgibbons showed me that hack<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:13:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, so i'm still getting the debug events.&#160; just got about 30 all on the atm0 interfaces.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:13:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; crap, and now i see why!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:13:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nvm<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:14:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that particular template still had a few offending OIDs in the data sources area evidently...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:18:01] &lt;MWT&gt; Hi all-- Is there a document that would show me how to setup my WMI permissions for Zenoss?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:18:31] &lt;MWT&gt; I'm using the Zenoss WMI collector, but the graphs do not populate and I occasionally am getting access denied errors<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:21:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; MWT: It's nothing specific for Zenoss, it's the same way you'd set WMI up for any monitoring tool<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:22:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; MWT: maybe this: http://www.poweradmin.com/help/enableWMI.aspx<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:24:08] &lt;MWT&gt; Thanks rmatte; im taking a look now<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:27:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:28:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; If that doesn't work, hunt around on google, there's tons of material on getting WMI working<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:28:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; as far as permissions go, the simplest way is to make the monitoring account an administrator<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:28:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; but you can also just add them in the WMI security section<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:32:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, well after the reboot all the events popping up i can find a reason for the event being created... so far so good!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:32:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:32:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; you didn't have to literally reboot the server<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:33:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; you just had to restart zenoss<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:33:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; there's a propVirtual and a propVirtual_64<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:33:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; sheesh.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:33:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i know.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:33:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; propVirtual_64 means it's a 64bit interface<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:33:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; server needs a good kick in the pants since it's also running NMIS as well<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:33:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i figured as much.&#160; just silly that there's a different type for that.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:33:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you need to copy the ethernetCsmacd_64 template for that one<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:33:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, it's not silly at all<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:33:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yeppers<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:33:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; it needs to be graphed differently<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:34:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; really?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:34:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:34:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i guess i don't get what the difference between a 64-bit interface is and a normal interface.&#160; i always think of processor arch when i think of 64 or 32 bit.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:34:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; because it's putting so much traffic through, the values are very large, it would just continuously roll over with the 32bit monitoring<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:34:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh i see<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:34:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; 64bit interfaces are basically gig interfaces<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:34:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; for register reasons.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:34:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; or even faster<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:35:00] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; makes sense.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:35:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:35:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm... i only see the .20 OID.&#160; is it possible that's the only bad OID for this type?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:36:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, it's always in pair<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:36:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i figured it would be at least one other.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:36:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; if errors up is bad, then errors down is bad too<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:36:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i can only find .20 tho in the events<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:36:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:36:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; packets in and packet outs<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:36:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; etc...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:36:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that makes sense for sure.&#160; just can't find any other OIDs in these events it generated.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:36:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; debug events can be finnicky<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:37:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, they seem to pop up at random.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:37:53] &lt;cgibbons&gt; hmmm<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:38:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea my main propVirtual template i removed everything but that OperStatus OID.&#160; perhaps I should match the propVirtual_64 to be the same...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:39:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; could be<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:39:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; easiest way to tell is to click on the interface<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:39:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so is this really the "preferred" method?&#160; just wait until events come in and filter them out thru templates?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:39:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; and see what is graphing and what's not<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:39:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's a dead giveaway<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:39:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:39:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, this is the "preferred" method<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:40:04] &lt;cgibbons&gt; bigegor - mray said you had a question about zenpacks &amp; hardware components?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:40:04] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ha.&#160; alrighty.&#160; just seems... cumbersome at best.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:40:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; once you have it all setup you won't run across debug messages often<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:40:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; and when you do it's a quick fix<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:40:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's meant to keep your monitoring accurate<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:40:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; alrighty.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:40:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; some other monitoring tools don't even report bad OIDs<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:40:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it seems like everything is fine when it's not<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:40:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:40:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i guess we've never monitored all these devices using SNMP<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:41:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, SNMP is fun<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:41:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; works well though<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:41:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i think we did the inital walk of all the devices to populate hostname &amp; location, but after that it was just up/down status.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:41:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:41:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; if we were doing full SNMP, the other solution certainly was not giving us any of this information, haha.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:42:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:42:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; full snmp really is the way to go<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:42:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; ping up/down monitoring is almost useless really<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:42:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i like it.&#160; just a lot of work.&#160; at this point i _really_ hope we stick with zenoss...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:43:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've seen routers that were pingable, but almost unresponsive because their CPU and Memory were pinned at 100%<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:43:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; and we wouldn't have seen that with just ping monitoring<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:43:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; very true.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:43:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm sure my boss will appreciate this system, once she sees how powerful it is.&#160; right now she just thinks i'm playing with something that is only going to be useful to me.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:44:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, once people see it all setup and configured they love it<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:44:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; the configured is the key <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:44:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just getting things to that point that takes some learning<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:44:18] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; indeedy.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:44:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i don't mind learning, in fact i love it.&#160; keeps me interested in coming into work every day!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:44:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; for sure<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:44:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I loved learning about Zenoss<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:44:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm at the point where i'm still learning stuff but not as much<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:45:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; There's always something to learn<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:45:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; of course.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:45:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and if you ever stop, you're going to fall behind.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:45:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:45:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss is definitely going places as a product<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:45:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's only getting better and better<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:46:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i had never heard of it before... maybe 3 weeks ago.&#160; but i definitely like what i see.&#160; the fact that several large enterprises use it made me more confident in picking it.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:46:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:46:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; people seem to scoff at OSS products, if they're free they must be crappy essentially.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:46:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; the fact that rackspace uses it alone gives it big props<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:46:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; for sure.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:47:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; and yeh, in this case it's an open source product with a company backing it<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:47:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; definitely<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:47:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; which ensures a quality product<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:47:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, the fact that there is enterprise support if you're willing to pay for it is a huge plus for us.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:47:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; some people were saying "Oh, it's not a true open source project because there's an enterprise version"<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:48:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; please.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:48:07] &lt;aclark&gt; is it possible/easy to install as another user w/stack installer? e.g. aclark instead zenoss<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:48:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, exactly<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:48:18] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; like saying ubuntu isn't an open source project.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:48:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; if anything that just guarantees that it's going to be supported<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:48:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; aclark, any reason you want to install it as a different user?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:48:50] &lt;aclark&gt; arrrghhh: yes, to avoid permissions problems in development<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:48:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:49:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well i wouldn't be able to answer your question, just curious as to why you would want to do that <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:49:18] &lt;aclark&gt; :-)<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:50:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, is there any way to make the sensors that flag on localhost less... sensitive?&#160; i just got 9 events, all for zenxxx heartbeat failure.&#160; zentrap, zensyslog, zenprocess, zenstatus, zenping, zenmodeler, zenperfsnmp, zenhub and zencommand.&#160; seems like the full gambit haha.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:52:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; aclark, what about installing from source or another method?&#160; I would think that would be easier than trying to get it to work with the stack installer.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:53:27] &lt;aclark&gt; arrrghhh: source is a giant PITA&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; but yeah. I'm about to find out re: stack installer<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:54:04] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; alrighty.&#160; hopefully some others will chime in for ya, i'm not so knowledgeable about zenoss or the installation process.&#160; i'm here to get help setting up the system myself <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:56:21] &lt;aclark&gt; arrrghhh: i hear that! it doesn't look like it's easy or suggested ;-)<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:56:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; no sir, i would say not...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 14:56:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; which is why i suggested the source method!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:10:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: not that I'm aware of, I just completely ignore those<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:10:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: They are way too sensitive in 2.5<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:10:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; Hopefully that'll get fixed at some point<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:26:58] &lt;MWT&gt; just reading up on your convo.... is it generally agreed that Zenoss works best with SNMP enabled and configured rather then WMI?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:27:25] &lt;MWT&gt; i started with SNMP on my systems, but using WMI is soooo much easier to deploy<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:27:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I personally use SNMP for the majority of things and only use WMI when absolutely necessary<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:27:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's personal preference<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:28:07] &lt;MWT&gt; ok, ill start to&#160; put in the extra work i guess<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:28:35] &lt;MWT&gt; what benefits would i see with using SNMP over WMI? It seems like maybe extra monitors?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:29:02] &lt;MWT&gt; I assume using both would be 'over-kill'?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:29:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, from what I understand, the latest version of the WMI Data Source pack provides full monitoring via WMI in Zenoss core<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:29:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; so not really<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:29:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just find that SNMP is less prone to failure<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:29:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; and more lightweight<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:30:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could use both if you want, wouldn't really matter as long as it achieves the desired results<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:30:54] &lt;MWT&gt; ok, thanks for the insight<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:31:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you do want to use SNMP instead of WMI...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:31:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; docs/DOC-3386<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:31:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; docs/DOC-3570<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:33:41] &lt;MWT&gt; sweet! thanks for sharing<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:34:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:35:02] &lt;MWT&gt; im going to attempt to install the zenpack now<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:35:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:35:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure you follow all of the instructions on the zenpack page<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:35:59] &lt;MWT&gt; question: does the advanced pack have everything that the simple zenpack has in terms of monitors, templates?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:36:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:36:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; the simple pack just puts a template right in /Server/Windows<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:36:27] &lt;MWT&gt; Cool, so i only need to install the advanced version?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:36:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's for people who don't care about monitoring the usage of each individual CPU or Core<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:36:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:38:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; also take note of this...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:38:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; External Dependencies: It consists of 2 bash scripts which collect the information from the SNMP Service. The bash scripts rely on the 'bc' and 'snmpwalk' commands, so make sure that you have those installed on your server before using this ZenPack.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:40:10] &lt;MWT&gt; installed on my zenoss server?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:40:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:40:17] &lt;MWT&gt; im using the zenoss 2.5 stack<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:40:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; just make sure that you can run snmpwalk and bc as the zenoss user<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:40:31] &lt;MWT&gt; i know i have snmpwalk, but not sure about bc<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:40:35] &lt;MWT&gt; ok<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:40:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; bc is generally a standard command<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:40:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you probably do<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:40:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; but check anyways<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:41:29] &lt;MWT&gt; i have the man page for bc, but have never used the command<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:41:41] &lt;MWT&gt; ill try it out before i get started. thanks for the head's up<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:41:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just a command for doing calculations<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:41:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; basically a commandline calculator<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:42:30] &lt;MWT&gt; cool, i have bc version 1.06<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:42:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can basically do stuff like: echo "(1 + 1)" | bc<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:42:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; doesn't matter what version it is<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:42:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're good to go then<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:45:45] &lt;MWT&gt; and do i need to install both zip (egg) files from your link?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:45:50] &lt;MWT&gt; or is one newer than the other?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:46:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; one is newer<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:46:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; notice the version numbers<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:46:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; install version 1.6<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:46:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you already installed version 1.2, remove it, then install 1.6<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:46:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, unzip before installing, it shouldn't be a zip file<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:46:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; the zenoss site just zips them automatically<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:46:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should just be a .egg<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:48:15] &lt;MWT&gt; cool, will do. thanks!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:49:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:51:08] &lt;MWT&gt; great! i have&#160; the zenpack installed.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:51:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:52:17] &lt;MWT&gt; looks good! ill start putting machines into their respective sub-groups<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:52:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:53:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; I stress using the snmpwalk -v1 -c &lt;snmp string&gt; &lt;host&gt; hrProcessorLoad method since a server can have 2 physical cpus but 4 cores<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:53:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; walking for hrProcessorLoad is the best way to be sure<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:56:36] &lt;MWT&gt; ive done that so far. so 1 line = 1 cpu regardless of integer value?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:57:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:57:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; the integer value is the percentage of usage for that cpu<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:58:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can add | wc -l to the end of the command which will count the lines and just output the number if you want<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:58:02] &lt;MWT&gt; oh, very nice. ok<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:58:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; snmpwalk -v1 -c &lt;snmp string&gt; &lt;host&gt; hrProcessorLoad | wc -l<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:59:05] &lt;MWT&gt; so i just added a machine to the 1 processor device class and checked the performance log<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:59:10] &lt;MWT&gt; i got the following error User-supplied Python expression (here.getRRDValue('MemoryTotal') * 0.9) for maximum value caused error: ['Memory_MemoryUsed']<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:59:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's normal<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:59:29] &lt;MWT&gt; just takes time?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:59:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; wait 15 minutes and you'll see graphs<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:59:33] &lt;MWT&gt; cool@!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:59:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; takes 3 polling cycles to start graphing<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:59:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; 5 mins per polling cycle<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:59:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; so 15 mins<br/>[10-Jun-2010 15:59:51] &lt;MWT&gt; that would have thrown me for a loop if i didn't have you hear. thanks for your support!!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:00:01] &lt;MWT&gt; *here<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:00:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:00:03] &lt;MWT&gt; lol<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:00:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure you add the transform in as described on the zenpack page<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:00:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; otherwise memory threshold alerts will display in bytes rather than percent<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:00:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; which will make little sense<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:00:42] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: got the zenpack working<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:00:46] &lt;mray&gt; adding a little polish<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:00:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: nice<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:01:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: That's going to be a handy pack<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:01:44] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: yeah, I'll probably try to get it into Core<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:01:50] &lt;mray&gt; as an optional modeler<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:01:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; for sure<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:01:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, optional being the key word<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:02:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mray, sweet!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:02:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wouldn't personally use it because our clients don't set uniform and correct location info on their devices<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:02:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; our network monitors are going to LOVE it.&#160; well, i'll love it at least because it means i don't have to do it by hand!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:02:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:02:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, we have very strict rules on what that value is set to.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:02:35] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: yeah, it should have a zProperty for whether or not to override if it's already set<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:02:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: the location info needs to be identical though<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:02:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: or you'll have multiple location organizers for the same location<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:02:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's all the exact address, city state &amp; zip.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:03:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, then you're good<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:03:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i believe the case is all the same as well...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:03:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: yeh<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:03:26] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: hmmm&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; I hope that works.&#160; The Location isn't the same as the Address<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:03:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that may or may not be true tho.&#160; i haven't done an audit of the network for that...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:03:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mray, i thought it was the location as given to google maps?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:04:15] &lt;mray&gt; no, I'm actually setting the Device in a Location<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:04:20] &lt;mray&gt; the Location has an Address<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:04:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm... perhaps i'm not understanding what the location is for...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:04:46] &lt;mray&gt; The Location is an organizer<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:04:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i have 130 sites that are all in the same geographic area.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:04:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's naming the location organizer after what's set in the SNMP location info I hope?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:04:54] &lt;mray&gt; "Datacenter1"<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:05:17] &lt;mray&gt; and "DataCenter1" will have something Google Maps recognizes in the Address<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:05:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: well, I use mine differently, mine are like 500 Paolo St. Mexico City 06785 Mexico<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:05:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; or whatever<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:02] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: for the Location?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; for the name of the organizer<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:11] &lt;mray&gt; I bet it still wroks<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:13] &lt;mray&gt; works<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i would have what rmatte has.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just have a bunch of top level organizers<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i don't have any locations configured<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; and yeh, I use that for the address too<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but i'd like each location to have it's own location organizer.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: yeh, you're looking to do it the same as I do<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:06:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; obviously some devices are at the same location, but for the most part the devices are scattered.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:07:18] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i think we're up to 140 branches and probably 140 or so ATM's.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:07:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: so just to get this straight, your pack checks the SNMP Location that's set on a device, checks to see if an organizer exists with the same name, if so, adds the device to that organizer, if not, creates the organizer using the name in the location field on the device then adds the device to it and sets the address to match as well?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:08:18] &lt;mray&gt; it does all of that, except for setting the address<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:08:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:08:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; setting addressed by hand can be a bit of a pain, it'd be a nice thing to add to it<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:08:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so what would google maps shows if the address isn't set?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:08:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; and if people need to edit it they can<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:08:46] &lt;mray&gt; that's a possible enhancement<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:08:52] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: nothing<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:09:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; it shows absolutely nothing if address is not set, it's ignored<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:09:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; awesome... can i make a request for that enhancement? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:09:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i see.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:09:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; makes sense.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:09:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; I usually just go through and manually copy and paste the name of each organizer in to the location field (sometimes I have to adjust some of them)<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:09:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's tedious<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:10:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; man, that BP oil leak is getting huge<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:10:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yes.&#160; i'd prefer an automatic method... kinda makes sense to me to have it built-into zenoss, but perhaps not many use the location field like we do.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:10:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: Well, I'm sure there's a way to do it via zendmd anyways<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:11:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; I could probably whip something up<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:11:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, freaking disgusting.&#160; do you know they actually said "there's other states that have shrimp separate of louisana" - yea, and there's other oil companies to buy oil&amp;gas from as well!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:11:31] &lt;mray&gt; well, setting the address is a minor nit, especially if all the devices are in the Locations<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:11:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; true<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:11:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: yeh, pretty brutal<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:11:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: agreed<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:12:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but, i'm lazy <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:12:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:13:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i probably could've done it all by hand by now several times over, but this way it'll get adjusted automatically if a device moves (and we update the SNMP information)<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:13:18] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; same with when a new device is added.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:13:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AAa0gd7ClM<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:13:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; obviously it should be an optional thing, but it'd be nice to have the option - import location data automatically.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:13:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, just be careful when you're updating the info or you'll end up with duplicate locations<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:14:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; the difference between an address missing a comma is enough to cause that<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:14:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:14:30] &lt;kobalt&gt; oye this graphing issue is driving me nuts ...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:15:28] &lt;kobalt&gt; I can snmpwalk the device, Zenoss can see the interface<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:15:42] &lt;kobalt&gt; but I get missing RRD files on all the ethernet interfaces<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:15:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; this video is hilarious.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:16:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: it's possible that the interfaces don't support collection of those OIDs<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:16:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've seen it on certain devices<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:16:23] &lt;kobalt&gt; it does tho I have 25 other devices that work just fine<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:16:29] &lt;kobalt&gt; same setup etc<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:16:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; what type of device?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:16:43] &lt;kobalt&gt; sonet 15454 with ethernet cards in<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:17:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you tried doing: zenperfsnmp run -v10 --cycle and watching for errors relating to that device?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:17:16] &lt;kobalt&gt; I can snmpget the device in question with the index for device<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:17:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; just because you can snmpwalk the device doesn't mean that the device is dishing out info for the OIDs for the interfaces on the device<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:18:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; It might not be for some reason, which wouldn't be a Zenoss issue<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:18:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you seeing any debug events for those interfaces?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:19:09] &lt;kobalt&gt; I just ran zenperfsnmp run -v10 --cycle --device chj-4541.noanet.net(my device)<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:19:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; --cycle runs it as a daemon in the foreground<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:19:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it'll keep running in cycles until you kill it<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:20:17] &lt;kobalt&gt; that is a lot of data lol<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:20:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:20:30] &lt;kobalt&gt; when I did just the one device it ran just that one<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:20:36] &lt;kobalt&gt; and it seemed to run fine<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:20:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; one of my zenoss servers gathers almost 18000 datapoints every cycle <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:21:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; 46000 for mine<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:21:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; which works out to about 60/second or more to fit it all in to a 5 minute polling cycle<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:21:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; wow, that's a ton hehe<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:21:38] &lt;kobalt&gt; and takes 43 seconds<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:22:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice, mine is monitoring across some pretty slow circuits for some devices so it takes a little over a minute<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:22:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; It wouldn't be so bad if all the devices were on the local LAN or something<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:22:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:23:05] &lt;kobalt&gt; mine are all over the state lol<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:23:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; mine are all over the U.S, mexico, and europe<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:23:21] &lt;kobalt&gt; but we are the backbone so<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:23:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; http://dmon.org/graphics/zenoss/gen2.png<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:23:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's a map of the client<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:24:45] &lt;kobalt&gt; afk a sec<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:24:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:28:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, holy crap, i just looked at that map.&#160; that's ridiculous.&#160; my map is going to be comical, all the dots are going to be in one place for the most part!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:28:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:28:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, here's one that looks more like missile command: http://dmon.org/graphics/zenoss/arm.png<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:29:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; haha, a little more focused<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:29:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:29:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i can't wait to have ours hammered out.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:29:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:29:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i just keep forgetting i have other things to do other than zenoss <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:29:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:30:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so i'm still confused about why i had to restart zenoss... do i have to do that every time i make a change/update to these templates?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:30:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:31:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; The collector portion only pulls down an update to the config every hour<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:31:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; and in some cases pushing changes doesn't cut it<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:31:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:31:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i see<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:31:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I recommended restarting it to avoid the wait<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:31:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i did have a ridiculous flood of events too<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:31:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; probably didn't help the whole situation.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:31:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; you won't need to restart very often<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:31:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you get the events cleared ok?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:31:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i haven't been flooded with debug events anymore, so the templates seem to be doin their job!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:32:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh yea.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:32:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; (still using the dmd code I gave you I assume?)<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:32:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:32:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; glad it's working<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:34:41] &lt;MWT&gt; rmatte-- my wmi advanced monitor is graphing properly. Thank you!<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:35:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, that dmd code didn't work... just clearing them thru the GUI...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:35:41] &lt;kobalt&gt; back<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:35:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i just got some more events that should be filtered by the template, i'm assuming that's from the 1hr latency for the config update.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:36:17] &lt;kobalt&gt; so from running the zenperfsnmp I get no errors for that device<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:37:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: it didn't work even when you did a commit() after?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:37:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; because it works for me<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:37:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, i think i had formatting issues, i couldn't get the first command to parse.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:37:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: are you seeing debug messages for those interfaces?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:37:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: check for debug events in the active event console and in the event history<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:37:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, i'm pretty sure it was user-error.&#160; i just couldn't get the synatx/spacing right from your text.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:38:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: oh, the spacing is important<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:38:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, yea, i figured as much.&#160; i just cleared the events from the GUI, no big deal.<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:38:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: the indentation is used like brackets in python for if statements, while loops, and things like that<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:38:38] &lt;kobalt&gt; nope<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:38:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:38:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: are you sure you have debug messages selected?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:39:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: it's not selected by default under the severity column<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:39:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, yes I am<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:39:54] &lt;kobalt&gt; I created a event view specificly for debug messages<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:39:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; k well, I don't know what to tell you, generally if RRD files aren't being created I'd expect you to see something when running zenperfsnmp or at least debug messages<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:40:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you're not seeing either then I've no idea since those are the only causes I've ever seen<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:40:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; have you tried walking the snmp values for the interfaces?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:41:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; take one of the OIDs in the interface template and snmpwalk it<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:41:14] &lt;kobalt&gt; yes and I get data from the walk and get<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:41:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; try removing the device then re-adding it to Zenoss?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:41:41] &lt;kobalt&gt; 2 times already<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:41:57] &lt;kobalt&gt; even did a&#160; reindex<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:42:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; do any RRD files exist for the device at all?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:42:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; cpu, memory?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:42:11] &lt;kobalt&gt; just uptime<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:42:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the performance stats aren't even being collected?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:42:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; or do you not have a performance template for that device?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:43:11] &lt;kobalt&gt; and I have some sonet RRD's for customer templates I built<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:43:18] &lt;kobalt&gt; but none for the ethernet interfaces<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:44:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a Cisco ASA with the same issue that you're describing actually<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:44:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; performance graphs all work but ethernet interface graphs don't<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:44:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; let me see what I can figure out<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:44:49] &lt;kobalt&gt; its weird I have 80 of these sonet devices, probably 40 have ethernet graphs<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:45:02] &lt;kobalt&gt; err 40 have ethernet ports<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:45:19] &lt;kobalt&gt; and they all graph except this one<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:49:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, this ASA is the same issue<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:49:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:51:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; what are your interface names on that device like?<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:51:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; mine are like...<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:51:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; Adaptive Security Appliance 'Ethernet0/0' interface<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:53:51] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: message/49518#49518<br/>[10-Jun-2010 16:54:59] &lt;kobalt&gt;

hmm nope<br/>[10-Jun-2010 17:09:06] &lt;kobalt&gt; you would think that would affect other nodes<br/>[10-Jun-2010 17:09:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have it graphing fine on one of them<br/>[10-Jun-2010 17:09:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm<br/>[10-Jun-2010 17:10:23] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg<br/>[10-Jun-2010 17:13:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's definitely nothing to do with the name, I'll try to figure it out and let you know if I do<br/>[10-Jun-2010 17:13:41] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, cool<br/>[10-Jun-2010 17:14:03] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, did you ever get your ticket daemon 100%<br/>[10-Jun-2010 17:14:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; interesting<br/>[10-Jun-2010 17:14:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; when I do zenperfsnmp run -v10 -d devicename on another device it exits cleanly<br/>[10-Jun-2010 17:14:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; when I do it on the device with the issue it hangs and doesn't exit on it's own<br/>[10-Jun-2010 17:14:51] &lt;rmatte&gt;

when the ping up events come in, what event class do they come in for?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:39:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i think /Status/Ping, 1 sec.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:39:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yup.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:39:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, and if you check that class, are there any event mappings there?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:40:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; if there aren't, go to the class then select more -&gt; transform from the dropdown meny<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:40:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; menu*<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:40:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and what i've noticed is the device will be flagged as down, but the snmp trap for "IpInterface" is green.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:40:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; empty<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:40:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, so more -&gt; transform<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:40:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok i'm looking at a big empty box for the transform.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:40:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; anything in there?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:40:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:40:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nope<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:41:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; Well, the status icon next to the interface will only change if you follow these steps exactly: docs/DOC-2494<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:41:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; and even then, if the device is seen as down by zenping it'll cease monitoring snmp<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; makes sense.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the fact that the status icon for the interface is green is irrelevant<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; alrighty<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; can you screenshot those events?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:18] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; sure<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; I want to see exactly what you're seeing<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; thanks<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; did you want details<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, just the list of events<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; or just the event history for that device?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; the stuff shown in the event console is enough<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, there's nothing active for it<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; they go up and down at random, and it's usually for less than a minute.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:42:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; get them from history if you need to<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:43:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, that's what i'm doin.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:43:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:43:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/3823/screenshot61120101143.png<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:44:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; wow that's crazy<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:44:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm not sure what those informational messages are.&#160; i guess changes?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:44:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm not lyin <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:45:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; those are from remodelling the device<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:45:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; any time you remodel you'll see a bunch of those<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:45:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah okie<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:56:20] &lt;forsberg&gt; arrrghhh yes i use maps :&gt; did you get your questiosn answered ? M)<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:57:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; forsberg, i guess i'd like to know how you use them... what are your location organizers named?&#160; do you just use a shortname that you recognize, the hostname of the device, or the address of the location?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:57:46] &lt;forsberg&gt; my locations correspond to my datacenter locations, so they are named "CITY1 DC" "CITY2 DC" etc<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:58:06] &lt;forsberg&gt; and then our big monitor screen has nice googlemaps api on<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:58:16] &lt;forsberg&gt; because my boss likes stuff like that ;&gt;<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:58:29] &lt;forsberg&gt; and to get a quick indication of whats wrong when something turns orange/red<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:58:30] &lt;forsberg&gt; ;&gt;<br/>[11-Jun-2010 12:59:58] &lt;forsberg&gt; i planned to have locations defined all the way down to racks but....<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:00:15] &lt;forsberg&gt; i changed that to make links in zenoss to our asset management<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:00:24] &lt;forsberg&gt; wich have that info already anyways<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:00:58] &lt;forsberg&gt; and then our asset management have links to zenoss and wiki wich all documentation<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:01:10] &lt;forsberg&gt; wich = wtih<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:01:13] &lt;forsberg&gt; with also<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:01:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i see<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:02:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; matt built an awesome zenpack for me, but it doesn't quite do what i need it to.&#160; it takes the sysLocation value from SNMP and creates a location organizer based on it.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:02:44] &lt;forsberg&gt; on my private zenoss, i have my homies vpn network and servers etc on, and there i just have the "Casa name1" "Casa name2" locations<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:02:45] &lt;forsberg&gt; ok<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:02:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; what i'd really like it to do (makes the most sense in our environment at least) is to make the hostname the location organizer<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:02:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and then pull that sysLocation value and put that in as the address.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:03:11] &lt;forsberg&gt; yes<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:03:18] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, having the full address as the name of the location organizer doesn't make much sense.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:03:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hopefully i can have him modify it.&#160; i poked around the code, and while it's not extremely complex i'm also not entirely sure what i would need to update to get it to work.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:05:27] &lt;forsberg&gt; yeah hmm<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:05:30] &lt;forsberg&gt; yes<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:06:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: it's really based on personal preference, I personally create the location organizers at the root level with the full address<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:06:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; like, named after the full address<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:06:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:06:47] &lt;forsberg&gt; yyeah<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:06:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i just wouldn't be able to identify anything based on that<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:07:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:07:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i don't know the address of all the location.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:07:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; locations*<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:07:26] &lt;forsberg&gt; hmm ?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:07:27] &lt;forsberg&gt; :&gt;<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:07:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so seeing an address would be relatively meaningless.&#160; it would help me narrow down the site, but i recognize the site based on a shortname we use internally.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:07:51] &lt;forsberg&gt; ah<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:08:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; like for us, we have devices named riUSrichmond001, and so on, so we know that those devices are located in richmond, and the address is used to know the precise physical location of the devices<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:08:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i guess i really won't be looking for sites in the locations container.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:08:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; indeed<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:08:32] &lt;forsberg&gt; well then i would defintely use that, and if noone who are looking at the zenoss can use the real address information to anything, it doesnt seem important<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:08:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; but if you go by some other code for the locations then you'll have an issue<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:08:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; It's really an organizational problem more than a technical problem<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:08:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so we have a site called ARVA.&#160; the hostname of the router is RARVA.&#160; that's what I know.&#160; the sysLocation field has the exact address for the site, but I don't know what it is.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:09:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you'd know quickly enough by clicking on one of the devices and checking<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:09:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so perhaps i'm making a mountain out of a molehill?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:09:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; does the location organizer name really matter then?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:09:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; kind of<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:09:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:09:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i do that sometimes.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:09:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; just need things put in perspective so it makes sense.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:10:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, with the pack that Matt designed the organizer name would be whatever is set in the location field<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:10:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea.&#160; which is not familiar if that makes sense.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:10:23] &lt;forsberg&gt; but you have insanely many locations etc ? or what<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:10:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; but then if you wanted to know the organizer for the ARVA location you'd find one of those device, click on it, then on the status page there would be a link right to the organizer<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:10:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's really just an extra click or two<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:10:31] &lt;forsberg&gt; i mean cant you test abit and see what works ? :&gt;<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:10:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; no big deal in my opinion<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:10:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; forsberg, there's about 300 or so branch locations between standalone ATMs and actual branches...<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:10:50] &lt;forsberg&gt; k<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:11:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i've only been to a handful, and even then it's not like their addresses are intimately familiar to me.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:11:34] &lt;forsberg&gt; only you use the zenoss ?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:11:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; que?&#160; are you asking if we use any other systems to monitor the network...?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:12:33] &lt;forsberg&gt; more like if you are the only one using the zenoss<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:12:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh no.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:13:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; we have a network monitoring department that is on-site 24/7 365.&#160; they'll be the main ones using it.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:13:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; other departments will probably use it sparingly, but they'll be the heaviest users of it.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:15:34] &lt;forsberg&gt; i fail to understand what your gonna use the location for then! but gl with it <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/> im afk to see the next worldcup fusssbaall game<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:15:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so perhaps i can just ask matt to have the address field of the location organizer populated in addition to the organizer being created, then i'll be good.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:16:00] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well the location will be used to see graphically which sites are up and which are down... what else would it be used for?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:16:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, once the organizers are created you can always go in and populate the addresses by hand<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:16:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; That's the way I do it<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:16:43] &lt;forsberg&gt; same here<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:16:48] &lt;forsberg&gt; but i dont have 300<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:16:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; it could also be done with a zendmd script<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:17:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, so that issue is happening right now.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:17:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; your critical ip is up events are mind boggling though<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:17:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; the device is listed as down<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:17:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't know what to say about those<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:17:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; put i have an event for IP being up<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:17:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:17:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:21:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i just know the monitors are going to freak out if i show them this system and the switches at a branch keep getting listed as being down...<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:33:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, but up events should absolutely never be critcal<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:33:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; critical*<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:33:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; the fact that that is happening is mind blowing<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:37:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; when did that start happening?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:44:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; Also, how many devices do you have in Zenoss?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:45:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; and what is the hardware on that server?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:45:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's entirely possible that you're overworking the server<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:45:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; so your polling cycles aren't completing properly<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:45:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; which might account for the strange behaviour<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:58:58] &lt;ashp&gt; I have a quick question if anyone feels helpful - I bound the mysql template to a server and now when I go to perf I have ONLY those charts.&#160; I seem to have lost the cpu/memory type charts<br/>[11-Jun-2010 13:59:03] &lt;ashp&gt; Is there a way to get all of the charts on one page?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:00:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ashp, i guess you could try to re-bind the default template to that device as well...<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:01:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, if the server were over-utilized, wouldn't it happen on all the devices?&#160; at random?&#160; it's only happening at one site, and we have a special situation with that site... i was assuming it was related to that special situation.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:01:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, with that said, i do believe we need more RAM.&#160; this box only has 2gb.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:02:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; ashp: when binding you need to hold down ctrl and select all the templates you want to bind before clicking save<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:03:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; ashp: otherwise you'll just get the 1 template that you selected<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:03:04] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it has a quad-core xeon... x5460 @ 3.16GHz<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:03:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah, that makes more sense.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:03:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; what "special situation" do you have?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:04:25] &lt;ashp&gt; rmatte: Aha, that's probably what I did.&#160; I'll go look.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:04:39] &lt;ashp&gt; Argh, I was really hoping there would be zenpack for my crappy emerson UPS's, but no luck<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:04:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; instead of traffic going over our normal MPLS wireline circuits, it's going over a P2P wireless connection.&#160; it's 100mbit, and typically we get less than 4ms ping times... but it is unique in that we don't have any other sites up on a system like that.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:05:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it looks like zenping is doing just fine tho. "Finished pinging 483 jobs in 3.21 seconds"<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:05:39] &lt;ashp&gt; rmatte: Aha, that works, thanks.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:06:12] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; guys, I am unable to add a&#160; user command<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:06:30] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; running core 2.5.2<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:06:43] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; I get a password error when I add the description and the command<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:07:20] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; Password Error Invalid or&#160; empty password.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:07:26] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; Any ideas?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:09:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to type in your password in the password field when adding the command<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:09:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's basically a password confirmation<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:10:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; should be a box at the bottom to enter in your admin password.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:10:03] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; yeah, that is the problem.&#160; I am typing my password<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:10:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; jimbosyn: are you logged in as admin?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:10:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; jimbosyn: or some ldap account?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:10:36] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; rmatte: im logged in as admin<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:10:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; jimbosyn: I find it only works as the admin account<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:10:45] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; I'm putting in the admin password<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:10:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; jimbosyn: well then I have no idea, I literally added a command yesterday and it worked fine with the admin account<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:11:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; that whole password confirmation crap is annoying, it's not properly implemented and it's buggy<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:11:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wish they'd just remove it<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:11:28] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; I tried on a core system with local auth, and one with ldap auth<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:11:36] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; both as admin, both same results.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:11:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; the local auth is all that's going to work<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:11:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; it definitely doesn't work with ldap auth<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:12:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; and when I say admin I mean the literal "admin" account<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:12:09] pmcguire is now known as ptmcg<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:12:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; not some other account that you gave admin privs to<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:12:20] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; rmatte: yep, I'm admin<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:12:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; no idea then<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:12:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; like I said, I did it yesterday and it worked<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:12:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; try again maybe?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:12:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; double check you're typing the password correctly<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:13:00] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; I even changed the password to be "password" because I suspected the @ sign in the other password<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:13:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; perhaps close your browser &amp; reopen?&#160; force yourself to reauth as admin?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:13:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; worth a shot<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:13:37] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; I'll try that.&#160; re-auth and then try again.&#160; If that does not work, I'll restart zope<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:13:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can also, as a workaround, go in to the zope management interface and copy one of the existing commands, then rename it and edit it as you please<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:14:02] &lt;ashp&gt; this is driving me crazy, I'm trialing zenoss enterprise and java jmx stuff just won't play nicely.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:14:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is what I end up doing sometimes<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:14:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, i just had a device come back up, but zenoss is reporting the snmp agent down... i was able to snmpwalk the device but it still says snmp agent down... am i just being impatient?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:14:17] &lt;ashp&gt; It complains it times out but I can telnet from the zenoss box to that port, so I don't get why it's failing<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:14:18] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; That's the thing.&#160; I can add the container, its when I add the details that things break<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:14:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: what kind of device?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:14:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, basic cisco 1800 series router.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:14:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you can try going in to zProperties for the device and changing zMaxOIDPerRequest from 40 to 10<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:15:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the most likely fix for that sort of thing<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:15:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; okie<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:15:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, Zenoss defaults to snmp v1<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:15:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure it's available via v1 and v2<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:15:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; what are you walking it as?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:15:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well the snmpwalk tried the command passing -v1<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:15:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, and it worked?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:15:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh yes.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:15:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; the other possible issue is that it's not providing all of the snmp info that it should be<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:15:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; almost immediately.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:16:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you walk it from the commandline, does it only output like 10 or 20 lines?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:16:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; or does it output around 50 to 100?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:16:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; let me see...<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:16:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you're copying the command from Zenoss, don't put system at the end<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:16:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; since that will only walk the system portion of the tree<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:17:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; just snmpwalk -v1 -c yourstring yourdevice<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:17:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i would definitely put it in the 50-100 range<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:17:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; if not more<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:17:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's still going haha<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:17:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:17:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; then try the zMaxOID thing and see if that fixes it<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:17:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:18:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; maxOID per request was already at 20...<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:18:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; jimbosyn: go to /zport/dmd/userCommands/manage_main<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:18:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i was messing with that value when i was getting all of those debug events.&#160; matt thought it may have been related.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:18:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; jimbosyn: then put a checkmark next to a command, select copy, then select paste<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:18:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; then rename it and change it to your liking from the management interface<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:18:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; that will bypass the password requirements<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:19:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; and hopefully the password confirmation will be fixed in the next release<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:19:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; (it drives me nuts too)<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:19:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: I see, well, not sure about the SNMP agent down events then, like I said, you might just be pushing the box too hard<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:19:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn even after remodeling the device it still shows the snmp agen down.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:20:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; you said you only have 2GB of RAM in there if I remember correctly?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:20:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; how can i check to see if i am over-utilizing the box?&#160; memory and processor utilization seem fine.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:20:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you're monitoring how many devices?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:20:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; unfortunately.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:20:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; around 500<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:20:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; just login and type top, and check your CPU and memory utilization<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:20:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; 100 are just up/down, we don't do snmp on the switches.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:20:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; or install htop and run that<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:20:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; which displays it even better<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:20:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, that's what i've been watching was top.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:20:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; try htop<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; this damned suse box, anything is a PITA to install.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i miss my debian-based distros @ work <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; still, 400 devices with SNMP monitoring on 2GB of RAM is a total no go<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol seriously?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that sucks....<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; especially when you have another monitoring tool running alongside it on the same box<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, seriously<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; my box that I'm monitoring 400 devices on had 5GB of RAM<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it seems to be doin just fine.&#160; but weird things like this come up, make me wonder.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; and even then it's nearly all used<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:21:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; this OS is 32-bit.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:22:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; what can happen is that since the box doesn't have enough memory it starts using swap space which massively affects performance...<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:22:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i tried to get them to bump me to 4gb... they said they may, but it sounds like i'll need a new server spooled up.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:22:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; definitely.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:22:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; then it's too slow to finish the polling cycles within 15 minutes<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:22:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; erm<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:22:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; 5 minutes rather<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:22:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; so when it hits the end of the cycle and isn't done polling a bunch of the stuff it thinks it's down<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:22:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it generates alerts<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:23:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to have a server capable of completing the polling cycle properly every time<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:23:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; hence you need hardware<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:23:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i would agree with you if it were a hodge podge of things that it's flagging as 'down'.&#160; unfortunately, it's always the same devices that get flagged as 'down'.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:23:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well, actually they're flagged as up i should say haha.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:23:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, but maybe those devices are always falling at the end of the cycle<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:23:59] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; rmatte: that works good<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:24:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think it does the polling alphabetically or something<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:24:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; jimbosyn: yeh, it's a half decent workaround<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:24:30] &lt;jimbosyn&gt; rmatte: I'll open a ticket with Zenoss for this.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:24:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; jimbosyn: until they get that straightened out<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:24:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; good idea<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:24:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, i guess that is possible... hrm.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:25:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, I have no idea why you are getting up events as critical<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:25:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's just bizarre<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:25:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well it seems we're having serious network issues<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:25:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i g2g, hopefully i'll be back later.&#160; thanks for the help rmatte<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:25:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; they don't really test Zenoss under inadequate hardware<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:25:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; k cool<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:25:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:52:04] &lt;Absenth&gt; is there any good way to re-generate default templates?<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:52:49] &lt;Absenth&gt; ie: /devices/servers/ --&gt; templates: device /devices/server<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:53:22] &lt;Absenth&gt; I'm not sure when it happened but sometime in the last two weeks the local /devices/server template got removed, leaving the default, ping only, /devices template bound to everything.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:55:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; Absenth: there's no automated way to do it, no<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:55:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll have to re-add it by hand<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:55:24] &lt;Absenth&gt; roger.<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:55:35] &lt;Absenth&gt;

how close to release is it?&#160; (rough estimaate)<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:56:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; only if you think it's smart to use beta grade software in production<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:56:54] &lt;Absenth&gt;

probably more 4 to 5<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:57:19] &lt;Absenth&gt; of course not.&#160; but different projects have different ideas of "beta" <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:57:32] &lt;Absenth&gt;

when 2.5.0 was released it was riddled with bugs, 2.5.1 was a bit better, but 2.5.2 was the MAJOR improvement<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:59:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; I make sure to test any release very well in my lab before deploying it to production<br/>[11-Jun-2010 14:59:36] &lt;Absenth&gt;

theacolyte: have you try event mapping?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:06:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: he also has his other monitoring system running along side Zenoss on the same box<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:06:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; so 2 monitoring systems sharing 2GB of RAM<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:06:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, i don't see any graph.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:06:19] &lt;theacolyte&gt; bigegor: No, was curious to see if there's another way to do it, I can do it that way<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:06:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, we're going to be getting rid of that other monitoring system.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:06:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: no graph at all!?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:06:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; you have absolutely no datapoints graph?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:06:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh wait.&#160; i'm retarded, 1 sec.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:06:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:06:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:06:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; didn't go to the perf tab haha.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:07:00] &lt;theacolyte&gt; .<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:07:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ranges between 40k and 100k<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:07:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:07:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; wow<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:07:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's a LOT<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:07:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; why so many?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:07:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; On my box with 400 devices I'm monitoring about 17.5K datapoints<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:07:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, closer to 18k now<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:07:58] &lt;theacolyte&gt; lots of switchports maybe<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:08:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I have 5GB of RAM in that box<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:08:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it's almost all used<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:08:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; we don't do SNMP on our switches<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:08:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you're getting massive amounts of datapoints from somewhere<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:08:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lots of routers &amp; switches.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:08:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; what kinds of devices are you monitoring with snmp?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:08:37] &lt;gordy&gt; Can I query the zenoss databases directly from ssh ?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:08:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; cisco routers &amp; cisco dsl routers.&#160; i should snmpwalk some of these switches to see what comes up.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:09:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; gordy: what type of data are you looking to query?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:09:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; we have a TON of these 'virtual endpoints' for SRST... perhaps Zenoss is trying to monitor all of those?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:09:29] &lt;gordy&gt; for example; "select * from devices where production state="some string" "<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:09:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: Zenoss won't monitor them unless it knows about them<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:09:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: Which I'd assume it doesn't<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:09:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, not sure...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:09:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: do they show up anywhere?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:07] &lt;gordy&gt; querying on the fly for stats and statuses<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, in all those debug events i was getting.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; gordy: well, the device info and stats are all stored in Zope<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; gordy: only events are stored in MySQL<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; gordy: you need to use zendmd to query zope from the commandline<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:32] &lt;gordy&gt; oh. is that anything like mysql ?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a python based relational database<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:51] &lt;gordy&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/sad.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, a ton of stuff was showing.&#160; unrouted vlans in some of our core switches (which we do have SNMP enabled on) and a ton of the EFXS ports that are setup for SRST if the branch loses WAN connectivity.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:10:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk for a sec, I'll give you some examples when I get back<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:23:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: I disable monitoring on unrouted vlans since monitoring them is basically useless<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:24:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, that wouldn't be generating all of these datapoints tho... would it?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:24:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; It could if you have them set to monitored<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:24:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:24:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; any interface that's set to monitored will account for 1 to 3 datapoints<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:24:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; same goes with disks, processes, etc...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:24:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so i should put them in as zInterfaceMapIgnoreNames?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:25:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; make sure you're only monitoring what you absolutely need to<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:25:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could do that<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:25:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; then remodel devices to remove them<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:25:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so all those templates i created didn't help?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:25:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; the templates are just to eliminate debug messages<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:25:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i thought i was only monitoring what i need to is the problem.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:25:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; you still need to be selective about what interfaces you want to monitor<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:25:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:25:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; otherwise Zenoss will monitor anything it sees as admin up<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:25:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; there's a ton of interfaces on each device.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:26:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, so you need to go through and selectively disable monitoring on stuff you don't want monitored<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:26:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; on each device?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:26:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; or just leave it and deal with the high level of datapoints<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:26:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, on each device<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:26:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well it sounds like the issue is these datapoints...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:26:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and damn.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:26:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i just don't have the time to do this much work on a network monitoring system.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:26:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless you have an interface labeling standard<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:27:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; like some of our clients start user more descriptions with UVxx:<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:27:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; eh kinda.&#160; some don't have descriptions at all, and i'm sure it's not uniform.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:27:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the description will be like UVxx: Jim Bob<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:27:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; then I have a script that automatically disables any ports with a description that starts with UVxx:<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:27:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; start user port descriptions*<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:27:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; rather<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:27:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea this one router says it has 272 interfaces.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:28:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and i can see a big list of these EFXS ports that are created for SRST<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:28:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, and if all those interfaces are admin up then it's monitoring all of them<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:28:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; they're not<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:28:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you don't need to be monitoring those ports add them to the ignore list in zproperties<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:28:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; then remodel<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:28:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; "Operational Status: Down"<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:28:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's operational status<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:28:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; Administrative Status: Down<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:29:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; operational and admin status are 2 different things<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:29:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok, then it won't be monitoring those<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:29:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i don't have a reason for all the data points then.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:29:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; the interfaces that are monitored will have a green status icon in the M column<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:29:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; on the OS tab<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:29:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm sure there's a reason, you just haven't found it yet<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:30:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, you mentioned it was between 40k and 100k...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:30:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; what is the current value?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:30:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; not max or avg, but cur<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:31:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; and does it seem to fluctuate or has it leveled out?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:32:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; gordy: you still around?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:33:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; current for zenperfsnmp i assume?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:34:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh damn... i think i may have found it.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:34:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well, part of it.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:34:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, current for zenperfsnmp<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:34:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; all these POTS dial peers are listed as UP interfaces.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:34:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; then that would be why<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:34:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; 66.24k<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:34:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll automatically monitor those because they are showing as up<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:34:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that's probably a big chunk of the issue...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:35:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; and if there's a ton of them, then that'll be a big performance hit<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:35:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so is there any way to filter those out globally?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:35:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; add them to the ignore list<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:35:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i really don't want to touch each device<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:35:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then remodel everything<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:36:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; I assume you don't need to see those on the OS tab of the devices?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:36:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; no<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:36:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, then yeh<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:36:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; they're just POTS dial peers<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:36:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so do i have to be specific on the Name?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:36:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, give me an example of how they look<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:37:00] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; like this one is named "Voice Encapsulation (POTS) Peer: 1866"<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:37:00] &lt;gordy&gt; yes still here was AFK a spell<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:37:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so you just need to add "Voice Encapsulation" to the list of ignore names in zproperties<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:37:30] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; cool.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:37:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i was worried I'd have to put all the #'s that follow... whew.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:38:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; example: ^(Voice Encapsulation|Voice Over IP Peer|Foreign Exchange Station)<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:38:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; the zInterfaceMapIgnoreNames right?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:38:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, that's what the ^ does<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:38:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; it tells it to look at the first part<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:38:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:38:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah right regex<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:38:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; after you've done that you need to remodel all devices<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:38:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:39:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; easiest way is to do: zenmodeler run<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:39:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; as the zenoss user<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:39:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i did that before.&#160; gonna do it again right now <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:39:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll obviously take a while<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:39:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:39:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, it took most of the day last time.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:39:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, well, you have a ton of devices so not surprising<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:40:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol yea<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:40:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; here i'm thinking we're small potatoes<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:40:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; not really<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:41:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; 500 is about the most I'd want to put on a single collector without firing up a second one<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:41:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; all the remote sites definitely add a layer of complexity most don't have to deal with.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:41:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:41:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; by the way, if the datapoints graph is repeatedly fluctuating it means that your polling cycles aren't completing properly...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:41:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; your goal is to get that graph to level out and to stay level<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:41:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea... i saw that in the logs.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:41:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; it may have the occasional drop-off but it should remain level<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:42:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; makes sense.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:42:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it was just trying to poll way too many devices.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:42:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; er, interfaces rather.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:42:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, yeh, too many objects<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:46:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so should i see the data points graph slowly drop down as it remodels?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:46:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; or do i have to wait for everything to be remodeled to start getting feedback.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:46:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup, unless it finds more stuff lol<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:47:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hahaha alrighty.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:47:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; check around and make sure there aren't any other mass interfaces that should be removed too<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:47:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you find some add them to the ignore list and restart the remodel process<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:55:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:55:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; maybe i should have it filter these EFXS ports as well<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:55:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; they show as admin down, but i really don't care about them.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:55:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; might as well then<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:55:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; to eliminate clutter<br/>[14-Jun-2010 13:55:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:01:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn, apparently we are doing SNMP monitoring on all our switches.&#160; that kinda changes things...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:12:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, so what would you recommend for my location organizer issue?&#160; i'm not really sure what the best method for our environment would be honestly.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:13:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's really up to you, you might just have to end up doing it by hand honestly<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:13:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; wow the data point graph just took a huge dip haha.&#160; hopefully this'll solve a lot of those weird lingering problems we've been having.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:13:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:13:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, hrm... yea i guess i could.&#160; i'd only have to do it once.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:14:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; exactly<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:14:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that brings up another question, with the backup built into zenoss does that catch everything?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:14:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; plus you can move multiple devices to a location at a time from the device list<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:14:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, it catches everything<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:14:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; or would i be better off taking images/snapshots of the server?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:14:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; cool.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:14:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'll have to play with that again, it kept timing out on me when i was playing with it.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:14:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; but if the server is a vm, snapshots are good too<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:15:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; I generally snapshot before I make any major changes to a server<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:15:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; that way I can roll back if something blows up<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:15:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea it's virtualized.&#160; and they're probably going to spool up a fresh server with more RAM and a 64-bit edition of SLES when we do go final with this.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:15:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i should probably go back to working on my requirements list... blah.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:16:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; You should ask for 4 or 5GB of RAM<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:16:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i'll see how much they'll give me.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:16:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; don't settle for any less than 4<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:16:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; seriously<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:16:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm going to ask for way too much, and say if we want to do WMI or any other monitoring we're going to need it.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:17:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; RAM is cheap, they shouldn't be stingy<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:17:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, good plan<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:17:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's all ESX-i pretty much.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:17:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:17:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but yes, RAM is very cheap.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:17:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; we use ESX on HP blades<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:17:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so are hdd's, but we still have issues with storage.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:18:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; most of our blades are dell... no comment.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:18:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; we have a good sized SAN, so we don't have storage issues luckily<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:18:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I'm not a fan of Dell<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:18:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:18:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, we just put in a new SAN.&#160; still migrating stuff to it.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:18:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:18:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; me neither, but i don't have to deal with the hardware.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:18:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, neither do I<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:18:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; put in a bunch of force10 switches, those things are ridiculous!<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:19:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; needed the b/w to the SAN Tho.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:22:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:27:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm, data points is climbing again.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:27:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'll just wait until they're all done remodeling...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:29:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, do you have any experience with voice T1's or do you just work with data T1's?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:30:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; really just data<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:30:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm.&#160; because it's breaking out a ton of interfaces for these voice T1's<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:30:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; define: "breaking out"<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:30:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; 'bearer channel' interfaces from the serial interface.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:30:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:30:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; 1 sec, i'll take a screenshot.&#160; like breaking out each channel on the T1<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:30:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've seen those before but I haven't seen an excessive amount of them<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:30:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; as its own interface<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:31:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; sub-interfaces<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:31:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:31:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; you might want to add those to the ignore list<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:31:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt you need to monitor every single one<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:31:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; breaks out the signaling channel as an interface etc.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:31:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; monitoring the physical interface should be enough<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:31:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; problem is, they're serial interfaces just like data T1's...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:31:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm, i also do have two T1 entries on the list<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:31:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so perhaps I can ignore all those serial interfaces...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:32:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i do like the information i get from the serial interface on the data T1.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:33:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; can I block interfaces based on "Type"?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:34:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; perhaps the zInterfaceMapIgnoreTypes field?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:36:44] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; so how does zenoss work "in the 'cloud'"<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:37:00] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; looking at collectd in an EC2 context and wondering how zenoss would compare<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:37:13] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; for syslog of course it's irrelevant, i'm thinking perf monitoring<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:41:50] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; otakup0pe: well, the AWS ZenPack can discover your instances associated with your account<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:42:24] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; so you can monitor via the CloudWatch API and then you can tie them to actual devices and monitor them accordingly<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:47:26] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; ok i'll look into that <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:47:27] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; thanks<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:49:30] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mrayzenoss, hey i really do appreciate you writing that zenpack.&#160; based on how wacky our environment is, and after a conversation with rmatte i've pretty much concluded the best way is going to be manually, unfortunately.&#160; i'm sure there'll be plenty of people grateful for you wipping up that zenpack tho!<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:50:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i just realized there was no lead-in to that, i'm talking about the SNMP location zenpack.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:50:51] * Simon4 will have use for it <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:51:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; there ya go!<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:51:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's a great zenpack, it's just our environment is lets say... special <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/>&#160; haha.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:51:54] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; heh<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:52:14] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; unrelated note; i have a question about the 'software' component of zenoss<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:52:27] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; i've been flirting with the idea of writing a collector/zenpack to populate that information for debian systems<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:52:37] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; is this feasible / madness / desired by community<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:54:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; what information, location?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:54:27] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; software packages/versions<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:55:08] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; rather, i guess, 'manufacturer / name / install date'<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:55:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh i see<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:55:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; interesting<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:55:18] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; i've never actually seen that tab populated. i assumed it's for windows only right now<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:55:25] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; but the information is all there for debian and it seems like a logical fit ?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:55:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i think that stuff is polled thru WMI<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:55:50] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; i'm just wondering if it's the sort of thing i could access from a zenpack "context"<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:56:05] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; or maybe i'm thinking collectors, not sure. the only zenoss custom stuff i've done has all been via web service<br/>[14-Jun-2010 14:56:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; should be, but i'm far from an expert on Zenoss <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Jun-2010 15:02:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; otakup0pe: blogs/zenossblog/2009/02/18/tip-of-the-month-snmp-software-inventory-for-debian-and-ubuntu-machines<br/>[14-Jun-2010 15:03:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; done!<br/>[14-Jun-2010 15:03:21] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I guess it could get rolled up into a modeler ZenPack to make it easier to share<br/>[14-Jun-2010 15:03:23] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; sweeet<br/>[14-Jun-2010 15:03:50] &lt;otakup0pe&gt; that's awesome <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Jun-2010 15:17:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; If anyone gets their hands on this, I'll help you write your ZenPack:&#160;

interesting...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 15:22:45] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg<br/>[14-Jun-2010 15:40:24] forsberg is now known as fOrsberg<br/>[14-Jun-2010 16:15:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, so is there a way i can put in an interface name to ignore based on the end of the line?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 16:19:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; not sure how you'd do that while still keeping the other rules for the start of the line too<br/>[14-Jun-2010 16:20:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; haha<br/>[14-Jun-2010 16:20:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i think i may have found a way around<br/>[14-Jun-2010 16:20:30] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm just hoping that i'm not ignoring devices/interfaces i want to see.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 16:21:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm filtering by device type now instead of just device name.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 16:21:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; er interface type instead of interface name.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 16:27:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yup that seemed to work.<br/>[14-Jun-2010 16:27:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'll just hope that didn't filter out any interfaces that we normally care about...<br/>[14-Jun-2010 16:27:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but this router used to have almost 300 monitored interfaces, now it only has 18 <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[14-Jun-2010 16:51:32] &lt;sergeymasushko&gt; how can I disable monitoring/modeling of processes on particular device?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:05:16] &lt;chewbranca&gt; I'm trying to get zenoss setup, I have the zenoss stack installed on a box, but now I'm trying to get a handful of servers on my local network talking with the primary zenoss box, is there not a zenoss-node package, or what's the approach to getting these boxes working together<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:18:24] &lt;st3v3o&gt; anyone still around ?<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:22:16] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; chewbranca: the zenoss server needs to be pointed at the boxes you want to monitor, and they need to be monitorable (ie. snmp or ssh or whatever)<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:22:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; FYI, I'm doing a Getting Started with Zenoss session tomorrow, I should go blog that<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:22:47] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; community/about/webinars<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:23:24] &lt;chewbranca&gt; ahhh cool<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:23:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; it's not completely automatic yet, but speaking of nodes I am working on a Chef cookbook and I'm finishing up my Cfengine integration<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:23:36] &lt;chewbranca&gt; btw, I'm Russell, the giant red headed guy from linuxfest northwest<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:23:49] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; ahhh, great timing<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:23:54] &lt;chewbranca&gt; finally have some time to get zenoss up and running<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:24:00] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I'm working on my Chef integration for Velocity next week<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:24:05] &lt;chewbranca&gt; going to start deploying out on AWS sometime next wekk<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:24:08] &lt;chewbranca&gt;

since I'm rusty with the Ruby<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:25:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I have the start of a Zenoss cookbook with a server and client recipe<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:25:43] &lt;chewbranca&gt; oh cool, I really need to get my box setup for webinar, tried to check out an engine yard live demo of their cloud computing platform, but couldn't get the damn thing to run properly with firefox or chrome on linux<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:25:51] &lt;chewbranca&gt; ahhh very nice<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:25:59] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; and it looks like I'll probably do an SNMP one as well for traditional IT shops<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:26:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I guess you could still do SNMP in the cloud actually<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:26:58] &lt;chewbranca&gt; yeah I got my development EC2 environment setup yesterday, running ubuntu enterprise cloud with eucalyptus, got 7 vms on there right now that I'm just messing with trying to get zenoss working with<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:27:25] &lt;chewbranca&gt; I'm thinking ssh connections will probably be the best approach since I'll have AWS servers, and standalone servers at a couple different locations<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:27:54] &lt;chewbranca&gt; but I want to get an AMI built this week that runs the framework and connects in with zenoss and what not<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:30:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; sounds interesting<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:32:03] &lt;chewbranca&gt; yeah should be cool, we've already got a handful of clients ready to roll with AWS, I just need to get everything locked down for administrating and monitoring additional servers<br/>[14-Jun-2010 17:32:21] &lt;chewbranca&gt;

kobalt: give it a try, I wouldn't be surprising if it fixes it<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:00:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; sweet... so on these locations... what determines the lines drawn between the actual locations?&#160; they seem to be, for lack of a better word... arbitrary.<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:00:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; suprised*<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:01:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; they aren't arbitrary, it's based upon sites having interfaces or devices in the same IP range<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:01:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if you have 2 serial interfaces in the same subnet at 2 different sites it draws a line<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:01:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm.<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:01:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; none of our sites are in the same subnet<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:01:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it'll do that for each set<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:01:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; you sure about that?<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:01:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and it's drawing lines back to a central site that's not the corporate office<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:02:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; there's NO lines drawn back to corporate, which also seems funny to me<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:02:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's common practice to create a 2 address subnet for links between sites<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:02:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well unless we're talking about something different in relation to subnet<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:03:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm saying, you can create a subnet with subnet address 255.255.255.252 that supports 4 addresses (2 being valid and 2 being the network address and the broadcast address) then use that to create a link between sites<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:03:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; that way you don't waste address space<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:03:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; or something like that, it's been a while since I've done subnetting<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:04:10] &lt;kobalt&gt; your correct<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:04:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; perhaps our provider is doing something that i'm not aware of...<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:04:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's possible<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:04:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but each branch has its own subnet<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:04:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, but that doesn't mean that the links between the sites don't share IPs<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:04:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; the link itself can be a tiny subnet consisting of 2 usable IPs<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:05:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; which are just used for the link itself<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:05:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; depending on how it's setup<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:05:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless none of your connection are direct and everything is going out over the cloud<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:06:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; all our cxns are direct.&#160; we have private lines going to each location.<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:06:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; right, private lines are generally setup like I'm describing<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:06:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; which could explain what you're seeing on the map<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:06:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; man these IP addresses are so different<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:06:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only way to know for sure are to check the IPs at either end of the links<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:06:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i don't see how they could even come close to being in the same subnet<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:07:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe it's not those particular interfaces then<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:07:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; but something is in the same subnet at both sites<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:07:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i should be looking at the WAN IP right?<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:07:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; as opposed to what?<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:07:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm.&#160; our DSL routers are all in the same subnet...<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:07:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; loopback or LAN<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:07:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; then that could be it<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:08:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's showing everything going back to one branch, which just doesn't seem right to me.&#160; it all should go back to the corporate office, but there's no links going there.<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:08:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; for example, if serial0/1 at site A has an IP of 192.168.0.1 and serial0/1 at site B has an IP of 192.168.0.2 it'll assume that there's a link there<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:08:53] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte: yep that fixed it duh I had loaded a zenpack and forgot to restart<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:08:56] &lt;rmatte&gt;

mray: that password auth that was added doesn't play nice with ldap at all, I find myself always using the management interface to set anything that requires secondary password auth<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:16:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: It'd be nice to just see that "feature" go away at some point<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:17:37] &lt;mray&gt; I imagine there are some bugs that are either opened or could be opened around that<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:17:43] &lt;mray&gt; but I don't think it's going away<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:17:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I also don't see the point of it when it's so easy to bypass<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:17:58] &lt;mray&gt; it's a "feature" required for some of the certifications<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:18:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; it can be bypassed easily via the zope management interface<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:18:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I do it all the time<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:18:29] &lt;mray&gt; it also fixed a cross-site scripting vulnerability<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:18:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:18:43] &lt;mray&gt; and access to ZMI is getting reduced in 3.0<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:18:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's kind of scary in a way<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:19:00] &lt;mray&gt; or, you can't just slap "/manage" on the end of any URL<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:19:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; but ok<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:19:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I just hope the password auth works properly then<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:19:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; otherwise it's just going to be one big roadblock<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:20:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can't even set email addresses for users right now without going in to ZMI<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:20:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a bit much<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:22:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; It is also proven to rouse the fail whale<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:22:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; and we don't need that guy floating around<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:23:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, so any other suggestions to lower my data point usage?&#160; It's still around 70k.<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:24:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; hunt through your devices and see what is still monitored<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:24:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; just interfaces tho right?<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:24:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's no automated way to figure it out, you need to put the time in<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:25:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; interfaces are most likely<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:25:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i don't mind, i just don't know what else to look for at this point.<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:25:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; you said you have 300+ devices, have you looked at the interfaces on every one yet?<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:25:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; if not, get to er'<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:25:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:25:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well most of the devices are the same<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:25:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; same stuff in 'em, same config, etc.<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:25:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; are you monitoring any servers, or is it all network equipment?<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:26:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so i figured if i hit the major device types, i'd be good across the board<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:26:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; currently just network equip<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:26:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, then likely cause is more interfaces<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:26:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's really nothing else it can be<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:26:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I'd say take another good look<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:26:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oy, i seemed to have filtered out the serial interface on this router as well... crap.<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:28:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; do a manual inspection of the interfaces on each device one by one and make sure that only the stuff that you want to monitor is monitored<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:28:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's all I can suggest<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:28:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:28:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i've already gotten rid of seemingly more than i want, and there's still a ton of data points after the remodel.<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:28:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you had proper interface labelling for everything it would be easy to do it automatically, but you don't<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:28:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; give me a screenshot of your datapoint graph<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:28:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; you mean in the description field?<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:29:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, the description fiel<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:29:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; d<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:29:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, we label all the serial interfaces<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:29:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; not not nearly all of the other interfaces are labeled...<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:29:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; exactly<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:30:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's impossible to automate enabling/disabling monitoring<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:30:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; needs to be done by hand<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:31:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; [04:26pm] &lt;rmatte&gt; give me a screenshot of your datapoint graph<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:49:30] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, sorry took a while<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:49:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

wow, yeh, that's nuts<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:51:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's fluctuating like mad too meaning your polling cycles aren't completing properly<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:51:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; indeedy<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:52:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's gotten a little better<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:52:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; you can see it was fluctuating a lot more before i made that change yesterday with the ignoring of certain interfaces<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:52:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; not really, that's still horrificly bad<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:52:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's supposed to be a straight line<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:52:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol i'm not saying it's pristine, just better <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:52:51] &lt;rmatte&gt;

6400 datapoints for 400 devices is a LOT<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:53:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; 64000 rather<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:53:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i was gonna say there's a 0 missing unless i'm way off haha<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:53:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; works out to 160 OIDs per device<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:54:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:54:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; maybe i should just not monitor all the ports on the switches<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:54:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless you legitimately have that many interfaces to monitor<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:54:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; because that's a big un<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:54:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well... legitmate is such a strong word.&#160; we _never_ used to do any snmp monitoring, other than servers.<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:54:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, you should just monitor key ports like trunk ports<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:54:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what we do<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:55:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; you shouldn't really care about server ports and user ports<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:55:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:55:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that makes sense.<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:55:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; If I monitored everything on my 400 device box I'd have about the same amount of datapoints<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:55:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:55:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'll start with the switches<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:55:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:55:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that's the only other thing i can think of<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:56:00] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; because i'd like to monitor the FXO and FXS ports if possible<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:56:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i guess i don't _have_ to monitor those...<br/>[15-Jun-2010 15:56:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nice!<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:04:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so how do i filter all of these switch ports?&#160; If i do it by name and put FastEthernet, it'll also filter ports on routers that are important...<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:05:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; go through and do it by hand<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:05:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; you don't want to ignore them<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:05:16] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; each port on each device?<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:05:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:05:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn...<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:05:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to the OS tab on each device and selectively monitor what you want<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:05:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; then lock the ports down so that it doesn't change when you remodel<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:05:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll only have to do it once<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:06:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; how do i lock the ports down?&#160; I see how to disable the monitoring...<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:12:08] &lt;kobalt&gt; I feel you, I have a large switch network.... thankfully I need to monitor all up ports so I have all ports that are up are monitored<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:12:42] &lt;kobalt&gt; to lock the port you do the drop down and lock<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:24:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:24:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn<br/>[15-Jun-2010 16:26:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so much clicking!<br/>[15-Jun-2010 17:02:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

I have two locations, CO and CORP.&#160; CO gets all the same alarms CORP gets - perhaps because they share part of the same name?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 09:43:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i just deleted the CO location organizer and re-created it<br/>[16-Jun-2010 09:43:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it has one alarm in it with 0 devices associated to it.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 09:45:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; just wanted to be sure that nothing from CORP was accidently associated to it.&#160; i was thinking maybe i somehow associated one of the devices at CORP with CO and CORP... but having it be associated to 2 locations doesn't make sense.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 09:45:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i would assume that wouldn't be possible<br/>[16-Jun-2010 09:53:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, so do you think the naming is an issue?&#160; I guess I could put in a larger name to see if it fixes the issue... just thought i'd point it out.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 09:55:06] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg<br/>[16-Jun-2010 09:57:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

otherwise the monitoring status of the ports will flip back to what it was when they remodel<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:25:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you probably have Zenoss remodelling every 6 hours or so automatically<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:26:28] &lt;rmatte&gt;

but doing it from the device list page is the quickest way<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:28:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, the default for automated remodelling is 720 minutes (12 hours)<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:29:11] &lt;rmatte&gt;

yeh, it looks ancient<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:33:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it is.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:33:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's slow<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:33:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; old<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:33:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

it ran fine for 4 years, but someone updated some piece of it... not exactly sure what happened but basically the nodes.csv file 0'd itself out.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:34:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea... problem is i'm the schmuck that has to get it to work again.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:34:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:34:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i've taken a backup of the necessary files with it in case it does blow up again.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:34:50] &lt;jb&gt; isnt that what backups are for? <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:34:52] &lt;rmatte&gt;

it was installed, and the guy who set it up left 2 weeks later.&#160; keep in mind, this was still 4 years ago.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:35:43] &lt;davetoo&gt; why can't you change?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:36:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well we are going to... eventually.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:36:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but for the time being we have to stick with what we've used until a new product can be properly evaluated.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:36:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; basically there's too many cooks in the kitchen at my company, just way too many people involved with decisions like this.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:37:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; perhaps you should continue to get Zenoss setup and then give them a demo of it?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:37:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that's the plan<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:37:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but my boss wants me to focus on getting NMIS working again in the short-term..&#160; blargh.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:38:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i mean it's working... just not well.&#160; and not how it should be.&#160; the logs grow constantly because of all the errors haha<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:38:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, managers suck sometimes<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:38:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; all part of the fun<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:39:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i understand why, i just wish she would stop insisting on fixing NMIS.&#160; the damned thing is broken, lets work on getting it replaced.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:39:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup, but managers have odd ways of thinking sometimes<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:39:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; indeed<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:39:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; the thing that makes the most sense gets pushed back for things that make no sense<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:40:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; she's got a lot of people putting pressure on her that i have no idea about tho<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:40:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, sh*t flows down hill<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:40:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you're at the bottom<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:40:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; pretty much<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:40:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:40:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; haha<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:40:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; almost<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:40:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; alright, i think i have all the switchports disabled<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:41:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well, the ones that we're not going to care about at least.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:41:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; haha that data point graph is looking a lot better<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:41:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; down to 22.62k it looks like<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:41:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that still seems like a lot tho<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:41:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; that is much better<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, that's close to what I have<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've got 17.5k<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; for 400 devices<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, more like 390, since 10 are ping only<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and with a dedicated box with more resources that should do fine<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; but honestly, if you can find more to tune, tune it<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; unfortunately i won't get that for a while<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's painstaking but it really only needs to be done in bulk once<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it makes a big performance difference<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:42:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; definitely<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:43:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, by the way... I have something that you'll be interested in when you do get better hardware...<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:43:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; unfortunately i have to spend my time on NMIS now.<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:43:18] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; what's that?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:43:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; docs/DOC-2521<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:43:24] * Simon4 has about 90k, across two collectors<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:43:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; good document on tweaking Zenoss performance<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:43:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; cool<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:43:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; thanks<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:44:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:44:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; myself and others have updated that document, so the settings are based on real world testing<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:44:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nice<br/>[16-Jun-2010 10:57:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah well back to work on NMIS.&#160; thanks guys, i'll ttyl.&#160; hey rmatte can you mention that bug to matt?&#160; i don't know if i'll make it back in here today... i also tried logging a bug but felt i would not be able to properly describe all that's required for logging the bug...<br/>[16-Jun-2010 11:42:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; Victory! I finally got the change management system to load cleanly in to the new version of OTRS along with all my custom mods<br/>[16-Jun-2010 11:42:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; woot<br/>[16-Jun-2010 11:59:27] &lt;kobalt&gt; hey rmatte is there a way to get a zendmd to read from a file of devices, so if I have a list of 86 devices I want to disable snmpmonitoring on<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:07:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: yeh, it's definitely possible, I don't know the code off hand<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:07:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: it's straight python, so figure out how to read in a file like that using python<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:08:03] &lt;kobalt&gt; I can do it in bash lol not sure in python, my pythonfoo is weak<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:08:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm sure there are guides all over the net<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:08:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; google is your friend<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:08:33] &lt;kobalt&gt; true, lol<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:08:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; are the devices in any particular group in Zenoss?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:08:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; or are they all over the place?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:08:47] &lt;kobalt&gt; no<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:08:51] &lt;rmatte&gt;

its a handfull in this one and one in that one<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:09:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; not change production state<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:09:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; he wants to change a zProperty to disable SNMP monitoring<br/>[16-Jun-2010 12:09:33] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Hello ,&#160; So if i wanted to query zope like a database (not sure what that term would be) how would I so I could for example do something like in mysql-land "select * from some.zope.table where server="blade%" and state="Decommissoned" "<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:18:58] &lt;aclark&gt; gordy: You wouldn't, because there is no one to one comparison between relational and object databases<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:19:05] &lt;aclark&gt; gordy: run zendmd to poke around the ZODB<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:19:34] &lt;gordy&gt;

select * from some.zope.table where server="blade%" and&#160; state="Decommissoned<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:22:06] &lt;gordy&gt; or even broader i want to list all decommissioned devices<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:22:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; so where the server name starts with blade?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:22:17] &lt;gordy&gt; yes, if possible<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:22:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; anything is possible, it's just not going to be a one liner like sql<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:22:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; one sec, I'll whip something up<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:23:10] &lt;gordy&gt; cool, if i can see an example i can work with it, otherwise this is going to be a struggle<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:23:15] &lt;aclark&gt;

Do they work?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:29:53] &lt;aclark&gt; Yeah the community examples are here http://tinyurl.com/3xrp4yo (I think)<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:29:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; aclark: If they are valid properties then they'll obviously work<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:30:13] &lt;aclark&gt; rmatte: they are Dublin core metadata (in Plone at least), probably any "CMF" app<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:30:19] &lt;gordy&gt; the problem is not using userland tools i.e. bash it will be challenging to do sysadmin stuff in lieu of a programming guru<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:31:06] &lt;rmatte&gt;

rmatte: Given that those are the values (the first one is "acquired") you wouldn't<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:32:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; gordy: I didn't know any python until I started using Zenoss<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:32:40] &lt;aclark&gt; rmatte: I was just curious if Zenoss was using them<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:32:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; aclark: I see<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:33:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; gordy: Also, I mix zendmd scripts with bash scripts all the time to do different things<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:34:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; to make a standalone zendmd script just add this to the top of the script...<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:34:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; #!/usr/bin/env python<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:34:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; import Globals<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:34:12] &lt;rmatte&gt;

then save it as a .py<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:34:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; and add the zendmd code below it<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:34:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; it obviously needs to be executed as the zenoss user<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:34:53] &lt;gordy&gt; acknowledged, i'm not opposed to learning anything new just i'm already behind the ball with ramping up on zenoss<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:34:58] &lt;Apachez&gt; Not even Hitler likes the Vuvuzela http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-Ln_rqPpPk<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:35:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; Zenoss takes time to learn, it's just a fact lol<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:36:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; took me 6 months to get really familliar with it and a year to be able to do almost anything with it<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:36:33] &lt;sciolist&gt; rmatte:&#160; yeah, but you have to admit the curve is pretty steep<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:36:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; sciolist: not as steep as some other software<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:37:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; sciolist: the curve for Zenoss is pretty mild honestly<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:37:12] &lt;sciolist&gt; yeah, Remedy comes to mind, personally<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:37:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; there's a lot to learn, but it's not mind melting<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:37:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, configuring Remedy is brutality<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:37:38] &lt;Simon4&gt; it's getting far far easier to learn as more people get better at it and hang out in here, that's for sure<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:37:44] &lt;sciolist&gt; sendmail, sans macros...<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:37:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: yeh, when I first started learning there weren't too many pros hanging around here<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:38:15] &lt;Simon4&gt; sciolist: the old saying was "It takes a genius to configure a sendmail.cf file from scratch, and an idiot to do it twice"<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:38:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: which is why I try to help people on in here as much as I can<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:38:21] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: yeah, also<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:38:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; Simon4: haha<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:38:53] &lt;gordy&gt; I've been spoiled with Zabbix's storing everything in mysql and i could just gen reports on the fly via cli and send 'em to a wiki page or email..<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:39:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, Zenoss only stores events in MySQL<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:39:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; but honestly, after learning how to access the data from zope via zendmd, I really like it<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:39:41] &lt;gordy&gt; and craft excellent end-user experience monitors<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:40:08] &lt;Simon4&gt; gordy: basically zope exposes all of it's DB as python objects, so once you get a handle on walking around them, it's just as easy as crafting a MySQL query<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:40:23] &lt;Simon4&gt; that gets you the config-management reporting side<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:40:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, you can also access them via xmlrpc and rest calls if required<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:40:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; but python is the most powerful way to do it<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:40:47] &lt;gordy&gt; i'm trying and i'll get it - kicking some screaming, but i'll get it<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:40:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:42:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; man, the memory management in 2.5.2 compared to 2.4.5 is astoundingly better<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:42:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've had my biggest Zenoss server running for 35 days now and it hasn't touched any swap space<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:42:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; in 2.4.5 I'd have half my swap space eaten by now<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:42:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:42:43] &lt;Simon4&gt; rmatte: as is the relation&#160; management<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:42:50] &lt;Simon4&gt; I haven't reindex'ed since upgrading<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:43:01] &lt;Simon4&gt; nor had to run any kind of cleanup scripts<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:43:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; I reindexed right after the upgrade, but haven't had to do it since<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:43:07] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah same<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:43:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've had to zeopack a few times, but not too often<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:43:24] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, i think that comes under actual maintenance though<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:43:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, sort of, in my opinion you shouldn't have to do it in the first place<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:43:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; but oh well<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:44:13] &lt;Simon4&gt; it would be nice if it was unneeded for sure<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:44:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; though my Data.fs files don't balloon up quickly at all<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:44:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's not a major issue<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:45:20] &lt;Simon4&gt; ours do a bit, but we have a lot of objects changing across modelling runs/etc<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:45:30] &lt;Simon4&gt; so it's a bit more understandable<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:46:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:46:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't even run zenmodeler as a daemon<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:46:30] &lt;aclark&gt; Just automate it and be done (e.g. via something like http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.recipe.backup/1.3 and http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.recipe.usercrontab/1.0)<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:46:42] &lt;jb&gt; ok so I have a windows box that zen keeps telling me has a service thats dying every 30sec-1min<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:46:48] &lt;jb&gt; but, it's not..<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:46:49] &lt;aclark&gt; (backups and db packing, that is)<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:46:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; jb: restart zenprocess<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:46:59] &lt;jb&gt; ive tried disabling monitoring for this specific service, but zenwin is still polling for it<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:47:02] &lt;jb&gt; its a windows service<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:47:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:47:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; zenwinperf then<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:47:20] &lt;Simon4&gt; aclark: I have zeopack + zenbackup cronned anyway<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:47:40] &lt;aclark&gt; Simon4: ah<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:47:43] &lt;jb&gt; k let me try that<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:47:52] &lt;jb&gt; actually, zenwin, not zenwinperf<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:47:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; jb: right<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:48:00] &lt;aclark&gt; Simon4: zenpack does repozo?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:48:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; jb: if that doesn't work, try a reindex<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:48:05] &lt;aclark&gt; err zenbackup i mean<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:48:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; aclark: oui<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:48:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; I assume you've already tried pushing changes<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:48:16] &lt;aclark&gt; neat :-)<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:48:52] &lt;Simon4&gt; zenbackup dumps Data.fs using repozo, dumps /opt/zenoss/etc, dumps /opt/zenoss/ZenPacks, dumps /opt/zenoss/perf and mysql db into a tgz file<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:48:57] &lt;Simon4&gt; replace path as appropriate<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:49:07] &lt;aclark&gt; Simon4: That sounds incredibly useful<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:49:57] &lt;Simon4&gt; aclark: indeed, it's enough to get a box back up and running on a good day (zenpack restores are a bit dodgy sometimes)<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:50:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; but yeah, install zenoss, install zenpacks, run zenrestore, box is back<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:50:36] &lt;aclark&gt; right<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:54:20] &lt;orange&gt; I've done some google searching but I can't find anyone who's used zenoss to monitor a mailfoundry spam appliance... have I not looked everywhere I should?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 13:54:29] &lt;orange&gt;

hehe<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:08:39] &lt;Zfield&gt; i have a box dedicated to my 'slightly' slower connection, so i just throw everythign on there<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:09:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; honestly, for the majority of my tv show and documentary downloading I just use ninjavideo<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:09:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; I wrote a script for it to automatically decrypt the captchas and download the stuff<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:09:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; it comes down at top speed<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:09:28] &lt;Zfield&gt; nice<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:10:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; so have you installed Zenoss yet?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:11:16] &lt;Zfield&gt; me? no<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:11:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah ok, what Linux distribution do you plan to use?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:11:43] &lt;Zfield&gt; right now i have ubuntu installed<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:11:50] &lt;Zfield&gt; but i could just as easily instlal another os<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:11:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; k cool, I'd recommend grabbing the stack installer then<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:11:55] &lt;Zfield&gt; i should say distro =)<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:12:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; I use ubuntu server on all of my production servers, it works fine<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:12:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; You could go with something like CentOS too as an alternative<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:12:22] &lt;Zfield&gt; would you recommend i grab the server install then?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:12:37] &lt;Zfield&gt; i'll be running it in a vm - starting off with vmware workstation<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:12:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, if you don't plan to be using it as a desktop then yes<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:12:45] &lt;Zfield&gt; then i'll just move it over to my esx server<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:12:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; ubuntu server doesn't install a GUI<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:13:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; making it more lightweight to run<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:13:48] &lt;Zfield&gt; ok<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:14:07] &lt;Zfield&gt; i guess when configuring zenoss its all text based anyway right<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:14:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; but anyways, when you do install it (or if you need help with the install of Zenoss), just drop in here, there's pretty much always someone around<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:14:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, Zenoss has a full web interface<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:14:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is where you'll do most of the config<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:14:27] &lt;Zfield&gt; ahh sweet<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:14:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; there are some commandline components too, but they are a bit more advanced<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:14:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll end up learning those later on most likely<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:15:02] &lt;Zfield&gt; i tried the tripbox? version of it (installed as a virtual app) but it kept hanging while tryign to access a server<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:15:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, is that the one where you can install it on windows?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:15:41] &lt;Zfield&gt; no, its when you have esx or vmware workstation running, and you just 'load it in'<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:15:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:15:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the virtual appliance<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:15:52] &lt;Zfield&gt; yeah<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:15:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never personally used it<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:16:06] &lt;Zfield&gt; i like the idea - get it and go<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:16:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; Yeh, it's more intended for quick demos or what have you<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:16:23] &lt;Zfield&gt; but... since i have an issue with it, i figured i might as well start from scratch<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:16:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, if you use ubuntu I'd recommend grabbing the stack installer<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:16:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's braindead simple to install with<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:17:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you just download .bin, then chmod +x it and run it<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:17:03] &lt;Zfield&gt; so how do i get the stack installer.. .and what is it :-p<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:17:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; then just follow the prompts<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:17:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's on the downloads page<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:17:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; http://community.zenoss.org<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:17:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; click the big blue download link<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:18:03] &lt;Zfield&gt; thnx. will do that tomorrow when i get back here<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:18:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; Then click Skip registration, go straight to download &gt;&gt; under the Register &amp; Download button<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:18:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; or register if you like<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:18:20] &lt;Zfield&gt; i gotta run, but thanks for your help =)<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:18:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:18:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; cya tomorrow<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:18:33] &lt;Zfield&gt; you probably will!<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:18:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:25:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: sorry that I didn't figure out that zproperties thing today (how to set it), I'll take another look tomorrow<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:26:47] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, its ok I got side tracked anyway<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:27:08] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobalt: what zProperties thing?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:28:04] &lt;kobalt&gt; I was looking for a way to run a zendmd script to set the snmpmonitorignore to true for a list of devices<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:29:28] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; setZenProperty('zSnmpMonitorIgnore', True)<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:29:34] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; call that off of each device<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:29:40] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; or the device class<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:30:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; I did a lot of device hacking on the Cfengine ZenPack<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:37:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, I was trying _setProperty<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:37:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it wasn't working<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:38:13] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; get the device<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:38:17] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; in zendmd<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:38:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; didn't know about setZenProperty<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:38:26] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; device = find("blah")<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:38:31] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; device.setZenProperty(...<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:38:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; cool, I'll remember that<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:39:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; he's actually doing a list, appending the devices to it, then doing: for device in mylist:<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:39:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:39:16] &lt;kobalt&gt; i get an error with that maybe I did it wrong<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:39:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; what error?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:39:39] &lt;kobalt&gt; http://fpaste.org/JceR/<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:40:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; is it maybe _setZenProperty mray?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:40:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; device._setZenProper(...<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:40:48] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; looks like his "d" is a string<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:41:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; ohhhh<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:41:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; right<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:41:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: how are you setting d?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:41:19] &lt;kobalt&gt; z<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:41:21] &lt;kobalt&gt; for d in yourlist:<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:41:29] &lt;kobalt&gt; in<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:41:33] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yourlist is a string?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:41:37] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; err, list of devices<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:41:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, yeh, that's why<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:41:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; sorry, that's my bad<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:41:57] &lt;kobalt&gt; not very creative with code lol<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:42:05] &lt;kobalt&gt; so I copied and pasted hehe<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:42:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; add: device = dmd.Devices.findDevice(d)<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:42:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; under the if<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:42:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; and then do device.setZenProperty('zSnmpMonitorIgnore', True)<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:42:38] &lt;kobalt&gt; the for loop?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:42:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, under the for loop<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:42:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; rather<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:43:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; that will set device to the proper value to query the device<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:43:24] &lt;kobalt&gt; then indent for the device<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:43:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; then use device.setZenProperty('zSnmpMonitorIgnore', True) instead of d.setZenProperty...<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:43:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, make sure the indentation is all correct<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:43:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; fpaste the code when you're done and we'll proofread it<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:44:02] &lt;kobalt&gt; http://fpaste.org/hGTQ/<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:44:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:44:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; the third line needs to be at the same level<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:44:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; http://fpaste.org/Hxfz/<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:45:04] &lt;kobalt&gt; k done<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:45:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; that will work once your throw your list in<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:45:24] &lt;kobalt&gt; yeah the list is there<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:45:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, give it a whirl<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:45:40] &lt;kobalt&gt; I just didnt include it here, no errors hehe<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:45:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I figured you wouldn't lol<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:46:03] &lt;kobalt&gt; hehe<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:46:11] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: take a look at http://zenpacks.zenoss.org/trac-zenpacks/browser/zenpacks/ZenPacks.community.Cfengine/ZenPacks/community/Cfengine/CfengineClient.py around line 73<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:46:32] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; the Cfengine server automatically adds devices to Zenoss from a list<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:46:45] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; lots of fun dmd hackery there<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:47:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; nice<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:47:13] &lt;kobalt&gt; ok so Im understanding this I created a list called youlist then added each item one at a time into d then did a search of the devices by usuing the string in D then set the property on that device<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:47:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; that pretty much sums it up<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:47:35] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; kobalt: sounds good<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:48:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; by doing the search you're setting the device variable as the path to the device, rather than the name of the device<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:48:18] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; rmatte: the only thing not working is kicking off modeling of the new device, which is in 3.0<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:48:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is required when querying or manipulating properties<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:48:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; mrayzenoss: ah, limitation of 2.5?<br/>[16-Jun-2010 16:48:39] &lt;kobalt&gt; nice!

rmatte, wtb that<br/>[17-Jun-2010 13:57:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I only have a couple of friends who like it<br/>[17-Jun-2010 13:58:25] &lt;kobalt&gt; yeah of course Im spoiled I had sushi in tokyo on the bay =)<br/>[17-Jun-2010 13:58:25] * chemist loves sushi<br/>[17-Jun-2010 13:58:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; I find techies tend to like it<br/>[17-Jun-2010 13:58:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; for whatever reason<br/>[17-Jun-2010 13:58:42] &lt;kobalt&gt; hehe<br/>[17-Jun-2010 13:59:08] &lt;kobalt&gt; nice thing is my wife likes it also<br/>[17-Jun-2010 13:59:34] &lt;kobalt&gt; so I get sushi when ever I want<br/>[17-Jun-2010 13:59:47] &lt;chemist&gt; lucky kobalt <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:00:21] &lt;kobalt&gt; she is awesome<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:00:49] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, what platform are you running your VM servers on<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:00:51] &lt;chemist&gt; my wife is pretty awasome,apart from not knowing how to cook lol<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:01:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: ESX<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:01:14] &lt;chemist&gt; and having nointerest in learning<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:01:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; enterprise version, not ESXi<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:01:39] &lt;kobalt&gt; mine does not cook in a traditional sense so we have a lot of odd meals. like raman noodles with aparagas and texas toast<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:01:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; my ex girlfriend was japanese so that's how I got in to sushi<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:01:47] &lt;kobalt&gt; &lt;&lt; last nights dinner<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:02:28] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, how do you like it Im doing a POC testing out both ESX and Citrix<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:02:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: It's insanely awesome<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:03:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: Also, I might add, that I absolutely hate citrix for anything other than desktops accessible via a browser (that's the only thing it does well)<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:03:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; It is balls for managing servers<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:03:55] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, yeah Im testing it as a VDI solution and VApps<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:04:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: VMWare is worth is just for VMotion<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:04:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; I can move a server from 1 blade to another and have like a 1 second blip<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:04:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if we need to take a blade down, we offload the vms to the rest of the blades and then power it down for maintenance<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:04:42] &lt;kobalt&gt; I have a box with citrix on it setting up a VMWare box<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:05:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, if you're installing VMWare ESXi, it doesn't have half of the features that the enterprise version does<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:05:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; cloning is an awesome feature too<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:05:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; I maintain a server template, whenever we need a new Zenoss server I just shut the template down, and clone it<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:05:36] &lt;kobalt&gt; thats what Im trying to get a test for I have thier eval software now<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:05:37] &lt;orange&gt; virtualbox claims to move running servers as well<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:05:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; then power up the clone, change the IPs, and voila<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:05:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; virtualbox implemented that feature recently I believe<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:05:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, I think they can<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:06:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; Xen can do it too<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:06:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; you may want to look at Xen<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:06:12] &lt;orange&gt; I haven't tried it.. just read about it<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:06:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; Xen is the open source equivalent of vmware<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:06:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; works pretty well from what I've heard<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:06:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never used it personally<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:11:38] &lt;kobalt&gt; rmatte, have you done much app virt?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:22:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; kobalt: I don't even know what app virt is, so that'd be a no<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:22:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; unless I know it by some other term<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:22:56] &lt;kobalt&gt; virtualizing the app XenApp does it<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:23:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; nope, can't say that I have<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:23:15] &lt;kobalt&gt; basicly running a program on the server and serving it to the desktop<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:23:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh, yeh, that's basically what citrix is designed to do<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:23:44] &lt;kobalt&gt; for instance I have a app that I have to use Java JRE2.0 but that wont run on windows 7<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:23:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; when I was contracting for the government we had a big project to do that involving citrix<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:23:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it was the biggest IT failure I've seen in my life<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:23:56] &lt;kobalt&gt; lol<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:23:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; we ended up rolling back<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:24:05] &lt;kobalt&gt; I hope VM can do the same thing<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:24:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; from what I hear, the word "Citrix" has been banned from that building<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:24:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's now to be referred to as "Thin Client"<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:24:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; the big problem was that they were trying to do it seamless<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:25:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; citrix works fine on a full virtual desktop<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:25:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; but as soon as you go seamless with it, it's a nightmare<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:25:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's unfortunate because the general concept was good, it would have been nice to see it work<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:26:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; the worst part was one day the router between the desktops and the citrix farm crashed, and the failover that was supposed to happen didn't occur, so everyone in that government department across the country lost whatever they were working on<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:26:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; some of my clients literally just got up and went home because they were so frustrated<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:26:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:27:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; sessions would freeze up on a regular basis too, at one point I was spending half of my days resetting Citrix sessions<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:27:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; I had 240 clients on my 2 floors and I'd get non-stop phone calls from them for frozen sessions<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:27:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; fun fun<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:28:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm not sure if vmware has a similar solution available<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:28:32] &lt;st3v3o&gt; rmatte that worries me a little&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; we are in the process of removing physical desktops and replacing them with citrix xendesktop bundled with xenapp<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:29:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; maybe things are improved since then, this was 2 and a half years ago<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:29:37] * st3v3o crosses fingers <br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:30:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd recommend you guys do a pilot, and not a small one either, because we did pilots of 20 users or so and everything went fine, but as soon as we started getting more special use scenarios the trouble started<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:30:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; for example, they virtualized microsoft office, so anyone who had specialized office plugins no longer had them<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:30:31] &lt;st3v3o&gt; yeah a pilots of aobut 20 was done here already no issues<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:30:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; how many users do you have total?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:30:51] &lt;st3v3o&gt; about 80<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:30:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, that's not too bad then<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:31:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; we had over 2000 users in the building<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:31:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it was much more challenging<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:31:12] &lt;st3v3o&gt; oh yea thats a bit more <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:31:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; hehe<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:31:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt it'll be as much of a nightmare for you guys<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:31:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; dealing with 2000 people is extremely time consuming when things aren't going right<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:32:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; I mean, I had 160 people per floor on 2 floors just to myself lol<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:32:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, sorry, 120 per floor rather<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:32:29] &lt;st3v3o&gt; totally understandable&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;.last place I was at I assisted in supporting 6k people across 13 sites<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:32:33] &lt;st3v3o&gt; it was a mess<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:32:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:32:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; Also, the more people you're supporting, the more IT services get scaled down it always seems<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:33:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; It was half a year of petitioning before I got them to give me someone as an assistant<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:33:17] &lt;st3v3o&gt; funny but true<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:33:31] &lt;st3v3o&gt; bigger places dont seem to have the vision for IT needs<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:33:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, and then there's the Canadian government, which is a whole other can of worms<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:33:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:34:00] &lt;st3v3o&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:34:10] &lt;st3v3o&gt; can't be any worse then our government<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:34:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; probably not<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:34:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; government is government<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:34:33] &lt;st3v3o&gt; private sector FTW<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:34:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; I had money to buy whatever I wanted, but the second I asked for a resource to assists me the sh*t hit the fan lol<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:35:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, If I were an actual government employee I would have stuck around for the pention, but the government tends to hire contractors these days over full time employees<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:35:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, it's canada, so you need to be bilingual to get a government position<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:35:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; which I am, but my french is rusty<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:36:16] &lt;st3v3o&gt; thats something that US is moving away from &#226;&#8364;&brvbar;out side of DC there are several bases that are moving contractors out and only allowing full time staff on base.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:36:28] &lt;st3v3o&gt; basically converting a bunch of folks to government employees<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:36:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it's not so much to do that it's canada, but it's the fact that Ottawa borders with Quebec.&#160; If you go more out west they couldn't care less if you speak french.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:36:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, I wish the government here would do that<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:36:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; because all these contracting places are just sitting in the middle making massive profit for doing nothing<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:37:08] &lt;st3v3o&gt; yeah taht is a BIG business<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:37:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; the contracting company I was working for were first nations (indians), so they worked out of their house, got all these big contracts, took a huge cut between what they received and what was paid out to us<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:37:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; so they were making insane amounts of money for doing hiring when required and for writing a bunch of checks each month<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:38:25] &lt;st3v3o&gt; sounds like my type of job <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:38:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; If the government just dumped the contracting agencies and did direct hiring, even if it was direct contracts, the employees would be paid much better and their overall costs would be lower at the same time<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:38:58] &lt;st3v3o&gt; ugg&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;I've hit my wall today and can't find the motivation to continue work<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:39:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; haha<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:39:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'll send an emergency air drop of miller<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:39:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's miller time!<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:39:46] &lt;st3v3o&gt; sweet<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:39:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; Or I'll send some canadian beer, Alexander Keith's pale ale.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:40:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; yummay<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:40:57] &lt;st3v3o&gt; I'm not huge on the beers&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;.but I do enjoy some whiskey<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:41:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah, then I'd send you some forty creek<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:41:23] &lt;kobalt&gt; mmmm wtb forty creek<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:41:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; wtb?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:41:43] &lt;kobalt&gt; want to buy sorry MMO speak<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:41:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:42:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you guys have forty creek there?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:42:13] &lt;kobalt&gt; nope but I love canadian whisky<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:42:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:42:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, forty creek is the best canadian whisky I've had<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:42:31] &lt;st3v3o&gt; not that I have seen &#226;&#8364;&brvbar;but I'll have to check the ABC store this weeken<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:42:31] &lt;kobalt&gt; and am always up to trying new stuff<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:42:32] &lt;st3v3o&gt; weekend<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:43:16] &lt;st3v3o&gt; aromas of honey&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;.honey whiskey is good stuff<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:43:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; There's Canadian Club, but it's garbage compared to forty<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:43:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; and they are about the same price too<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:43:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never had honey whiskey<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:44:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; sounds intriguing<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:44:39] &lt;st3v3o&gt; American HOney is ok<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:44:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've had mead before<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:45:44] &lt;st3v3o&gt; interesting<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:46:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; mead is what the vikings used to drink apparently<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:46:29] &lt;st3v3o&gt; yeah like thick beer no ?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:46:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not thick really<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:46:46] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Ah one of my favorite topics<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:46:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just like sweet wine<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:46:51] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Candian Whiskey is disgusting<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:46:55] &lt;theacolyte&gt; And shouldn't even be called Whiskey<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:46:57] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Cough syrup<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:47:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: depends on what whiskey you try<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:47:09] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Sorry, stick to Maple Syrup and hockey<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:47:12] &lt;theacolyte&gt; hehehehe<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:47:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: we have good whiskey and bad whiskey, clearly you've only had the bad stuff<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:47:42] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I have never had a good Canadian Whiskey, and I've tried a bit, but never that fourty creek stuff<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:47:56] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I'm a pretty big whiskey snob though<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:48:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: well, what do you think of crown for instance?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:48:26] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Disgusting<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:48:38] &lt;st3v3o&gt; I still prefer good old JD&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;.some with the charcoal filtering<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:48:41] &lt;theacolyte&gt; Give me a bottle of Balvenie<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:49:04] &lt;st3v3o&gt; crown isn't that bad&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;.its a much lighter whiskey<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:49:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: balvenie is a malt, completely different<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:49:12] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I know<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:49:26] &lt;theacolyte&gt; In all seriousness, I find Canadian whiskey to be much too sweet<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:49:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: you can't compare malt to rye<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:49:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: some people like sweet whiskey<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:50:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; theacolyte: fourty is fairly sweet when compared to american whiskeys<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:50:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; but it's definitely not sugary sweet <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:50:41] &lt;theacolyte&gt; I like American whiskey's but not nearly as much as I like scottish whisey's<br/>[17-Jun-2010 14:50:51] &lt;rmatte&gt;

I remember there used to be CPU and memory and probably some other things in that perf tab, but they're not there any longer... how did i remove them and how can i add them back?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:43:11] &lt;mray&gt; which device class are the devices in now?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:43:42] &lt;mray&gt; recall that the graphs are provided by the performance templates that are bound to the device, and if you change device classes they may go away<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:44:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yes, ok maybe a better question would be is what template provided those graphs?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:44:17] &lt;mray&gt; probably Device<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:44:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k.&#160; i don't remember un-binding any templates.&#160; i'll make sure that one is still bound properly.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:45:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; any ideas about that bug?&#160; i was thinking maybe i was doing something wrong, and somehow a device got listed in two locations... i just don't see how that's possible.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:47:38] &lt;mray&gt; when you move a device between locations, the previous events are still associated with that location<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:47:55] &lt;mray&gt; so after you move it, send them to history<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:49:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, events have a variable that they store the location of the device in when the event comes in<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:49:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; so just moving the device won't make the event immediately show up in the new location<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:50:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; also, when you're binding templates, make sure you hold down alt and highlight all of the templates that you want bound<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:50:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; not just 1<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:50:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; otherwise you'll only have the one template that you highlighted bound<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:54:45] &lt;mloven&gt; hey guys, I've got a question that seems simple but is kinda stumping me right now....<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:55:29] &lt;mloven&gt; You know those "OID blah is bad" events that pop up?&#160; I've got tons of them right now and I can't seem to get rid of them.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:56:19] &lt;mloven&gt; And, before you answer, this isn't a case of having the wrong template (i.e. copying ethernetCsmacd to etherCsmacd64), etc.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:56:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; ummm, so you've created and customized templates for each one?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:57:00] &lt;mloven&gt; Most of these are on standart Gig-E or Fast_E interfaces, and they all have the appropriate template for their type<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:57:05] &lt;mloven&gt; *standard<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:57:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; for instance, if you have interfaces with type frame-relay, you've created a template called frame-relay?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:57:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; (I'm trying to gauge how much you understand the way Zenoss handles interface templates)<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:59:26] &lt;mloven&gt; Guage away&#160; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/>&#160; I've been through the "OMG I have to copy the ethernetCsmacd template to propVirtual, or whatever" plenty of times.&#160; Like I said, these are mostly interfaces that are ethersmacd type or, in a couple cases ethersmacd64.&#160; In both cases, they are using the "same-named" template.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 16:59:38] &lt;mloven&gt; that's why this is a weird one for me...<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:00:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, another thing to understand is that 2 interfaces may have the same type, but they may not support the same OIDs<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:00:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; for instance, if you have virtual sub interfaces of an ethernet interface<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:00:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mray, i deleted the location organizer &amp; recreated it... that wouldn't have cleared the events for that location?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:00:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; they'll be of type ethernetCsmacd, but they won't support error OIDs<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:01:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; now, the crappy part is that the only way to fix that is to either remove the errors OIDs from the main template, or create a local template on each of those interfaces and modify it to remove those OIDs (which is tedious).<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:01:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:01:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'll brb guys<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:03:28] &lt;mloven&gt; rmatte, I get what you're saying, but in most cases, these are standard Gig-E or Fast-E (no sub-interfaces).<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:09:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mray, that "Device" template was the one, thanks!<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:09:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i must've unbound that template when i bound that PingPerf template... ah well.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:09:37] &lt;mray&gt;

nope.&#160; didn't know I needed to.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:14:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; mloven: someone else was having an issue where they created custom templates and kept getting debug messages but then they restarted zenoss and they went away<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:14:14] &lt;mloven&gt;

you were missing an r <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:16:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol the first one he must've tab completed<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:16:18] &lt;Simon4_&gt; heheh<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:16:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:16:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; woohoo, I'm almost done customizing the new version of OTRS, can't wait to get this deployed, it shall be spiffy<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:18:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mray, i definitely think it's a bug.&#160; if you have something for me to try if you think it's my setup i'm all ears...<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:18:37] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: go ahead and open a bug, with good recreate steps and we'll see what we can do<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:18:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh that was my other question.&#160; let's say google maps can't find a particular location, is there a log file that shows me bad locs?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:19:08] &lt;mray&gt; I don't believe there is<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:19:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mray, ok... i started opening one under the zenoss user, but i didn't feel comfortable completing it.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:19:22] &lt;mray&gt; that's what the zenoss user is for<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:19:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well i wasn't sure how to recreate it exactly, other than creating a site with a portion of the name of another site.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:19:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: The way I troubleshoot bad locations is to go in to the locations section, click on each location one by one and then click on the map tab directly under each location<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:20:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; if it draws the map with the single location you're good, if not, then that's one that you need to fix<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:20:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, ha, i was afraid of that.&#160; alrighty then, thanks.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:21:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; alright.&#160; 86 locations entered, about halfway there for our branches...<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:21:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; this map is getting messy haha<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:22:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol, yup<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:23:01] &lt;Simon4_&gt; if you had a "locations" file you could script that fairly easily<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:23:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:23:45] &lt;Simon4_&gt; have a text file full of locations, then use a python script to add those locations out of the file<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:23:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh i see what you're saying<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:24:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i'm almost done... figuring out/writing a python script at this point would probably take more time haha.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:24:26] &lt;Simon4_&gt; *nod* true<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:24:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm far from a python expert<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:24:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; heck, i wouldn't even consider myself a novice haha<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:24:55] &lt;Simon4_&gt; I'm an automation junkie, so it always heads that way <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:25:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i always try to<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:25:04] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; if i can<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:26:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but since there's no error file<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:26:07] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; this allows me to verify each address as i put it in<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:26:16] &lt;Simon4_&gt; for sure<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:26:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i didn't realize that i had to verify them manually until now tho, so there's 80-some sites that i haven't verified yet <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:26:34] * Simon4_ still has one address in zneoss that appears on the completely wrong bit of the map<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:26:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; haha<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:26:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; no sites in anartica huh?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:26:53] &lt;Simon4_&gt; everyone keeps asking me which DC we have in east London<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:27:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; haha<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:27:25] &lt;Simon4_&gt; if I put the address into google maps, it gets it right<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:27:32] &lt;Simon4_&gt; for some reason in zenoss, not so much<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:27:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; weird<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:27:38] &lt;Simon4_&gt; yeah, very much<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:27:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; *should* be no different.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:28:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; you're putting in the full city state &amp; zip?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:28:24] &lt;Simon4_&gt; yeah, exactly the same string goes into the desc in zenoss that does into google maps<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:28:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:28:35] &lt;Simon4_&gt; it worked in 2.5.something, then broke one upgrade<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:28:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i was just making sure you weren't being vague with your addressing and not including the zip or something like htat<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:28:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:28:51] &lt;Simon4_&gt; now it places it about 30 miles away from where it should be<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:28:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; shouldn't matter, but i'm not sure how picky it is<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:29:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; very odd...<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:29:07] * Simon4_ hasn't spent much time looking at it, but it's amusingly odd<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:29:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea it's going to be interesting when i roll this out<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:29:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; everyone in the company is used to an extremely old looking system.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:29:53] &lt;Simon4_&gt; heh<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:29:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and a lot of people here are scared of change.&#160; should be fun.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:29:59] &lt;Simon4_&gt; v3 certainly isn't that <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:30:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i'm excited about it<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:31:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; wondering when it will be final... i'd rather roll it than 2.5.2 actually.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:31:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I doubt you'll have many problems, from a general user standpoint (not administrative) the interface is quite easy to use<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:31:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it's flashy, which people like<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:31:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well most people like flashy<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:32:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; unfortunately the department that uses this heavily... not so much.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:32:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:32:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; they despise even the smallest change<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:32:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it's not only flashy but functional<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:32:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:32:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; we upgraded their phones to IP phones and they flipped out.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:32:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I don't see how it can be worse than what you already have<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:32:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; they love them now, but jeez it took a while for them to quit complaining.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:32:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; really?&#160; I absolutely love IP phones<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:32:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, so do most of us humanoids haha<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:32:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:33:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; the monitors... they're a different breed.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:33:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I really need to do a scheduled reboot of my servers next week so that I can get rid of this sawtooth graphing in the datapoint rate graph<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:33:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; I applied the patch 2 weeks ago but didn't restart zenoss<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:33:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; sorry, not reboot, just restart zenoss rather<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:34:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh, you should see my data point graph now!<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:34:10] * Simon4_ considers a restart to be a BAU activity<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:34:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; looks *much* better<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:34:16] &lt;Simon4_&gt; and deals with it as that<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:34:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; BAU?<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:34:36] &lt;Simon4_&gt; at least now were off 2.5.1. which required reindexing etc before a restart<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:34:42] &lt;Simon4_&gt; "business as usual"<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:34:54] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol i started googling it myself.&#160; that was the closest thing that made sense.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:34:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, 2.5.0 and 2.5.1 were brutal<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:34:57] &lt;Simon4_&gt; total UI downtime on a normal restart is under 10 seconds, so it's acceptable<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:35:01] &lt;Simon4_&gt; rmatte: yeah<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:35:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; I held off on upgrading until 2.5.2 was released<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:35:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

with 2.4.5 and the memory leak from rrdtool in that version I had to restart every week or two<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:38:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; all the swap would get munched up<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:38:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, damn... that would drive me nuts.<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:38:15] &lt;Simon4_&gt; 2.5.1 was the same with zeo<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:38:22] &lt;Simon4_&gt; box would eat ram<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:38:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; now with 2.4.5, I've had it running for 35 days and it hasn't even touched swap<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:38:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh by the way, there are some patches to make zeo faster on 2.5.2, I can pass you the list if you want<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:39:01] &lt;rmatte&gt;

ah cool<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:39:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think it was cgibbons who passed me that list<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:39:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; oh no<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:39:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; it was rocket<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:39:53] * Simon4_ saves<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:40:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's another reason why I need to restart zenoss on all my boxes<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:40:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I applied those too<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:40:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; and haven't restarted the majority yet<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:40:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; I restarted a couple and have noticed performance improvement<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:40:45] &lt;Simon4_&gt; awesome<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:41:08] &lt;Simon4_&gt; so I have a box sitting with our live db on it, running away with all the RRD files in /ramfs<br/>[17-Jun-2010 17:41:14] &lt;Simon4_&gt;

I'm not sure how I managed that, I thought the templates would be triggered by key words in the template name...<br/>[18-Jun-2010 10:30:51] &lt;Guest40826&gt; Greetings.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 10:31:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hello mister guest<br/>[18-Jun-2010 10:31:58] &lt;Guest40826&gt; We keep having alerts for tail this, vi that.&#160; After deleting them from OS, we have to restart zenprocess to clear them.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 10:32:05] &lt;Guest40826&gt;

So the template is seeing "httpd" and grabbing it as a process that it should monitor.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 10:32:51] &lt;Guest40826&gt; Any thoughts on how to prevent this?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 10:33:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm actually having template issues myself.&#160; i *thought* i understood how they were implemented, but i was dead wrong.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 10:35:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mrayzenoss, are you around matt?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 10:35:52] &lt;mrayzenoss&gt; yeah, sitting in a demo<br/>[18-Jun-2010 10:35:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:00:15] &lt;gwb2351&gt; if you had a list of devices, and wanted to mass-bind a template to that list of devices programatically, how woud you do this?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:00:39] &lt;gwb2351&gt; note: devices are not all in the same class, so inheritance/hierarchy is not an option<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:03:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; gwb2351, see docs.huihoo.com/zenoss/admin-guide/2.1.1/ch07s07.html<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:08:09] &lt;gwb2351&gt; hmmm... example 2 might work, but was looking for zendmd example (this template monitors HTTPS certificate expiration)<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:08:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; not sure, i'm having a ridiculous template problem that i seemingly created myself...<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:11:56] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

gwb2351: you can bind templates in zenbatchload<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:30:17] &lt;mray&gt; or do it with zendmd<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:30:45] &lt;gwb2351&gt; yeah, i was looking for the zendmd code if people already knew it<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:31:00] &lt;mray&gt; gwb2351: 1 sec<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:31:56] &lt;mray&gt; in zendmd, get your list of devices to update<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:32:01] &lt;mray&gt; and for each of them, call<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:32:11] &lt;mray&gt;

(If any of that just made sense...)<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:42:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; Kristopher424: what kind of issues are you seeing?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:43:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm just curious since nothing is really unfixable, so before going to that length there are probably other solutions<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:43:25] &lt;Kristopher424&gt; rmatte: dmd errors: message/49789#49789 and some other things, like Zenoss reporting all network devices lose ping, then come back up several times per day...when other NMS softwares don't see it.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:45:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; well first off, have you tried removing and re-adding the few devices that you're having issues with?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:45:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; it looks to me like there is some property in zope that shouldn't be there, or there's a property missing<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:45:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've seen similar with the zProperties tab before<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:46:26] &lt;Kristopher424&gt; I have deleted, re-added, and even added new devices and have gotten the dmd error.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:46:42] &lt;Kristopher424&gt; They're all one type of device, though...not varying by make or model.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:47:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; Kristopher424: have you tried a reindex for starters?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:56:42] &lt;Kristopher424&gt; Reindex for the device, yes.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 11:57:25] &lt;Kristopher424&gt; Ha, I don't know what I'm talking about.... reindex isn't per device.&#160; Yes I've done a reindex and commit.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 12:05:42] &lt;rmatte&gt;

the only time I've seen that happen is when people terminate it before it's done<br/>[18-Jun-2010 13:02:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; since it sits at 100% progress for like 5 or 10 minutes<br/>[18-Jun-2010 13:02:29] &lt;rmatte&gt;

oh, that I don't know about<br/>[18-Jun-2010 13:22:03] &lt;npmccallum&gt; we should give samba patches as GPLv3 but ship those patches as GPLv2<br/>[18-Jun-2010 13:22:37] &lt;npmccallum&gt; mray: is wmi in revision control somewhere?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 13:22:42] &lt;mray&gt;

ok, I have a fun one for you guys...<br/>[18-Jun-2010 13:32:38] &lt;npmccallum&gt; ke4qqq: for most of the patches they appear to be irrelevant to zenoss itself but are related to zenoss shipping our own versions for many platforms<br/>[18-Jun-2010 13:33:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; I have a device where the correct interface names are set in ifName, example: .1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1.382 = STRING: 5/48<br/>[18-Jun-2010 13:33:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; but Zenoss uses ifDescr, so instead I'm getting: .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.382 = STRING: 10/100/1000 utp ethernet<br/>[18-Jun-2010 13:33:38] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Is there a way to force Zenoss to specifically use ifName instead of ifDescr for these devices?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 13:36:49] &lt;npmccallum&gt; you'll have to check the modeller plugin<br/>[18-Jun-2010 13:39:14] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you'll see an existing threshold there<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:32:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; and the max value will be set to: something * 0.9 or whatever as I recall<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:32:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you want to switch it to 80, make it 0.8<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:32:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; and save it<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:33:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can also do it per drive (say you want everything monitored at 90 but only 1 drive at 80) by making a local copy of the template from the templates tab after clicking on the drive, then editing that local copy<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:33:35] &lt;nzle&gt; I dont have a Drives on the os page.&#160; do you mean one of the mountpoints under Filesystems?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:33:59] &lt;nzle&gt; yes, ok, got it.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:34:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you want a second notification at 90, add a second threshold exactly like the first, but set it to 0.9 or whatever<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:34:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, I mean one of the mountpoints<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:34:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; I used "drive" as a general term<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:34:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; I didn't mean an actual physical drive<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:34:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:35:59] &lt;nzle&gt; I see thats defined at /devices/server.&#160; If I go there and do it then the 2 thresholds will work for everything, right, then I can override as needed with local copied on specific devices or filesystems.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:44:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's right<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:44:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's a relational database so parent templates get applied to anything under there<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:44:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; them*<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:45:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; so if you modify it in /Server it will apply to every device under that class<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:45:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's actually a pretty nice layout<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:45:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; anyways, afk for 5<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:55:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; hmmm, this code modification might be a bit more complicated than I thought<br/>[18-Jun-2010 14:55:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually, hmm, maybe not<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:40:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; man, this collector plugin is like chinese to me right now lol<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:40:51] &lt;rmatte&gt;

grrr<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:46:24] &lt;Zfield&gt; gives you a reason to learn chinese :-p<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:47:08] &lt;Zfield&gt; if i have a file on a windows desktop, how can i get it to my ubuntu server box?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:47:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:47:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; check out InterfaceMap.py and you'll see what I mean<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:47:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm trying to figure out how to get it to use a second SNMP value instead of how it's currently setting the names of the interfaces<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:48:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; but there's a lot of processing that I don't fully understand yet<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:48:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm out of here in 2 minutes anyways, I'll pick it up Monday<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:48:38] &lt;Zfield&gt; i got 12 more min here :-(<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:48:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; If I can get this working I shall be very happy<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:49:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; basically what I'm doing is, Zenoss uses ifDescr to set the interface name by default, but that sometimes doesn't make sense since the ifDescr info is super generic whereas the ifName info is useful<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:49:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I want to make it so that you can set which you want to use for a device in zProperties<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:49:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; ifDescr being the default and ifName being the alternative<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:50:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; since right now I have a few devices where every interface is named something like: copper ethernet (10/100) since that's what ifDescr provides on that device<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:50:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; but ifName provides the actual interface names<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:51:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; If I can get this working cleanly I'll try to get them to implement it in to 3.0<br/>[18-Jun-2010 15:53:22] forsberg is now known as fOrsberg<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:43:23] &lt;nzle&gt; I'm confused.&#160;&#160; I installed net-snmp on a host and allowed port 161 in iptables.&#160;&#160; My boss wanted me to prove that it was refused though by default so I removed the 161 rule.&#160; if I telnet from the zenoss box to the box in question on port 161 it is refused.&#160; However zenoss continues to show no problem with snmp unless I kill the deamon on the box in question.&#160; if I restart it, it clears, yet it refuses port 161.&#160; What am I misunderstanding??<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:43:58] &lt;chemist&gt; nzle: port 162?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:44:28] &lt;nzle&gt; havent done anything with that one.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:44:39] &lt;chemist&gt; if I'm not mistaken 161 is to access snmp<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:45:00] &lt;chemist&gt; 162 is for snmp sending to server<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:45:17] &lt;chemist&gt; can you snmpwalk the device?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:45:33] &lt;chemist&gt; from your zenoss box?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:47:03] &lt;nzle&gt; just a sec, but from what Im hear you saying, 161 is inqueries from zenoss to the box, 162 is response/status coming from the box<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:48:05] &lt;chemist&gt; I think that's how it works<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:48:21] &lt;nzle&gt; yes, I was able to snmpwalk it and got a few dozen lines of output.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:48:45] &lt;chemist&gt; in that case 161 is open<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:49:48] &lt;nzle&gt; so what is best practice on having snmp on production boxes and controlling who can mess with it.&#160; deny those 2 for all and allow from the monitor?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:50:09] &lt;nzle&gt; Hmm,&#160; ok, Ill look closer.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:50:35] &lt;chemist&gt; yes, and a community name that isn't public or private (the defaults)<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:51:35] &lt;chemist&gt; you can also set snmpd.conf to only allow certain hosts to access snmp<br/>[18-Jun-2010 16:52:10] &lt;chemist&gt; same with windows<br/>[18-Jun-2010 17:08:05] &lt;willwh&gt; host allow is your best option nzle<br/>[18-Jun-2010 17:08:11] &lt;willwh&gt; that's how I run the show anyway <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[18-Jun-2010 17:08:40] &lt;willwh&gt;

it's 1am, and I've been drinking for a while<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:57:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nice<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:57:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and you just signed into #zenoss...?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:57:15] &lt;Simon4&gt;

heh<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:57:39] &lt;Simon4&gt; what's bung?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:57:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i have all these custom templates<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:57:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; because of a flood of debug events for 'bad OID'<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:58:00] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but the templates don't seem to be bound any more.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:58:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i somehow had them ALL bound to every device, and that was just messed up.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:58:30] &lt;Simon4&gt; ah yeah, not good<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:58:35] &lt;Simon4&gt; bind to device class, not devices<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:58:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so i tried to get everything back to the way it was, and now it seems the custom templates aren't being used at all.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:58:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i guess i'm confused on how the bind is supposed to work<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:58:56] &lt;sytem&gt; 3am here and im trying to figure out why our zenperfsnmp complete 9 runs out of 10<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:59:11] &lt;Simon4&gt; check the zDeviceTemplates zProperty on the device class or the Devices<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:59:23] &lt;Simon4&gt; I find it a much more reliable way to find out what templates are bound<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:59:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; Simon4, yea, i was looking at that... i cleared it all out<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:59:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; sytem, do you have a ridiculous number of data points or a puny server hardware-wise?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 18:59:52] &lt;Simon4&gt; right... did you clear it out, or did you remove it from the overridden options on the bottom of the zproperties tab?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:00:11] &lt;Simon4&gt; if you just clear the textbox out, you're overriding the properties, and they won't inherit<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:00:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm not sure what you mean by that second part.&#160; i think i just cleared it out...<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:00:19] &lt;Simon4&gt; vs removig it at the bottom of the page<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:00:25] &lt;Simon4&gt; check the bottom of the page on that tab<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:00:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; 1 sec lemme look<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:00:30] &lt;Simon4&gt; you can "clear" a zproperty<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:00:52] &lt;Simon4&gt; sounds like that's what you've done, so it won't inherit the templates from the device class<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:01:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; what "delete local property"?&#160; that section?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:01:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; yeah, that<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:01:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i definitely did not use that.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:01:18] &lt;Simon4&gt; so delete the local property of zDeviceTemplates<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:01:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; there isn't one<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:01:33] &lt;Simon4&gt; then set the templates you want the devices to use in the device class containing the devices<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:01:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's set to "Device" and "PingPerf" which is the template Matt helped me create.<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:02:04] &lt;Simon4&gt; on the device? or the device class?<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:02:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm, before the templates seemed to figure out what device to use based on the name of the template<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:02:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; the /Device class<br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:02:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; er /Devices I guess <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[18-Jun-2010 19:02:34] &lt;Simon4&gt;

rmatte, hey man... i screwed up my templates bad.&#160; i guess i'm not exactly clear on how they're bound... i think i've effectively unbound all templates from any interface or device, as i'm not getting any graphs under perf now.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:48:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, it's impossible to unbind templates from interfaces as far as I'm aware<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:48:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; they are just automatically bound based on the same<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:48:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; name*<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:48:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that's what i thought<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:48:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; how did you manage to unbind all templates?<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:48:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well, maybe the named templates are still bound<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:48:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; because i'm not getting flooded with debug events<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:48:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; they probably are<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:48:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; if you click on an interface do you see graphs?<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:49:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well i was trying to get the template that showed cpu and memory info for cisco routers<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:49:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; in the perf tab<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:49:27] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and somehow managed to bind all templates to all devices, because i had a TON of broken graphs in the perf tab<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:49:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's the "Devices" template under /Network/Router/Cisco<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:49:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so i did the reset bindings command<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:49:40] &lt;rmatte&gt; ah<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:49:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; to hopefully get the templates back to how they were<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:49:44] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; now i have nothing in the perf tab.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:49:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; you're going to have to go through and rebind all the templates by hand<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:49:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; no way around that<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; the ones that you won't have to do are the filesystem and interface templates<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; or processes<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i can bind based on device class tho right?<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; only device templates need to be rebound<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, you bind at the top level of the class<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; and it'll bind to everything under it<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i don't have to go to each interface or even each device<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; it won't be much work<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, that's what i thought.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, you don't<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:50:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; you only have to rebind the device templates<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:51:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; all other types of templates such as interface and filesystem are bound automagically<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:51:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:51:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; afk, going to grab some lunch<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:51:30] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i was hoping with the rebind command that the device template for cpu/mem would come back<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:51:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; cool, thanks.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:52:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; np<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:58:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; well I got my PingPerf template workin again... still not getting cpu/mem tho.&#160; i bound the "Device" template to /Devices/Network/Router/Cisco and /Devices/Network...<br/>[21-Jun-2010 11:59:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; Looks like I have it set to /Devices/Network/Router as well.&#160; Overkill<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:00:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; you know you have to hold down the ctrl key and bind multiple templates at once right?<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:00:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can't select bind template, highlight one, then click ok, then select bind template again, select another, and click ok<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:00:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; you'll only end up having the last template that you selected bound<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:01:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm doing it thru zProperties<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:01:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; zDeviceTemplates<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:01:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, no, don't do it there<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:01:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:01:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to the class, then select Manage -&gt; Bind Templates from the meny<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:01:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i thought it was easier to do it there<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:01:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; menu*<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:01:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you'll get a list of possible templates<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:01:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; then hold down the ctrl key and select all templates you want bound to that class<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:01:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; and click ok<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:02:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i don't have a bind templates from the manage menu<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:02:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; there's the templates tab...<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:03:20] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i've always been confused by this interface tho, it only gives me two templates to choose from and they're already both highlighted.&#160; it gives me the PingPerf template and the Device template.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:04:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, go to the templates tab<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:04:42] &lt;rmatte&gt; then it should be in the meny<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:04:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; menu*<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:04:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i see the bind templates in that menu<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:04:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; (I'm just doing this off the top of my head since I'm eating lunch)<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:04:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:04:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; use that<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:04:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but everytime i go there, it only gives me two options<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:05:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; which are both already selected/highlighted.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:05:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; then those are the only 2 that you can apply<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:05:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; PingPerf and Device<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:05:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll only give you valid options<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:05:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; anything that doesn't show up isn't valid<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:05:31] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:05:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:05:38] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it looks like it's already bound then<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:05:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's either not a device template or it's not high enough in the tree<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:05:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; the Device template that is.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:05:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, now check the bindings at each level down<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:06:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; all the way down to the device, right?<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:06:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's possible to have it bound at a high level but to have binding lower down that override it<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:06:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:06:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; (this is why you need to be careful when working with template bindings hehe)<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:06:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i really butchered them<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:06:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i kept reading different guides on how to properly bind templates<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:07:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and a lot of the stuff i read said to use the zProperties for the templates<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:07:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; binding them from the menu option is the proper way<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:07:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and the bind menu option was confusing<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:07:19] &lt;rmatte&gt; I've never touched that zProperty<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:07:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; never had need to<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:07:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; hrm<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:07:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; I don't think the Device template is correct<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:08:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; the description says "Basic template that only collects sysUpTime"<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:08:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; There are various different templates named Device<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:08:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; check for a different Device template as a lower level<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:08:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:08:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; pretty sure it's right under /Network/Router/Cisco<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:09:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; Yea all I have is Device<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:09:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and PingPerf<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:09:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; both are already selected<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:09:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; check the Device template under /Network/Router/Cisco to see if there's anything other than sysUpTime in it<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:09:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nope<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:09:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; then you've somehow deleted that template as well<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:10:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; because I know it's there by default<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:10:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; although it looks like it sent me back to the /Device master template<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:10:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:10:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; so the Device template that was under /Network/Router/Cisco is missing<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:10:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it's picking the Device template from a higher level<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:10:35] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i figured the reset bindings would get me back to default/normal.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:10:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; which just has sysUpTime<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:10:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; not if the template is actually completely missing<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:10:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; damn<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:10:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; you somehow deleted it<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:11:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i didn't think i was able to delete built-in templates...<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:11:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; yes, you can<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:11:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; crap<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:11:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; which is why you need to be careful<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:11:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; how many other templates did i delete<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:11:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i thought i was just clearing out my stuff<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:11:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; all the built in stuff is very deletable<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:11:41] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; this all started because i was trying to adjust the thresholds for utilization<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:11:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; which would be in your interface templates<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:11:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i didn't want the thresholds to apply for devices here @ CORP.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:11:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; which have nothing to do with bindings<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:12:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and i mucked around in there, and somehow deleted all my templates...<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:12:11] &lt;mray&gt; arrrghhh: you can fire up the VMware appliance, create a zenpack and add back all the deleted templates<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:12:25] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, that's just about your only option<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:12:28] &lt;mray&gt; export them, then reload them on your other install<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:12:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:27:28] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; stupid question, how can i setup a device for ping monitoring only?&#160; I removed the snmp community and port, but they keep repopulating... i'm guessing from my global settings.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:27:44] &lt;mray&gt; use the /Ping device class<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:27:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh i put them in /Device/Network<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:38:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; or, if you wanted to keep them in /Network you'd need to go in to zProperties and set zSnmpMonitorIgnore from false to true<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:38:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/wink.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:38:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; the same can be done for other types of monitoring such as ping and ssh<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:39:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you choose to do it that way do it in the device's zproperties, not on the zproperties of the class<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:39:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; since it would affect anything under /Network<br/>[21-Jun-2010 12:39:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; but using /Ping is the simplest<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:17:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so is there a way to export all the templates in one foul swoop?<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:17:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and yes, i meant foul <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:23:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; you need to create a new zenpack, then go through and put checkmarks next to the templates and select add to zenpack<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:23:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; do it for each one that you need<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:23:25] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ok<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:23:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; then export the ZenPack and install it on your Prod server<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:23:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; looks like i lost all my templates... i wonder if i should just grab all of them.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:23:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can if you want<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:23:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; won't hurt anything<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:24:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so for those devices i just want ping monitoring on<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:24:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i moved them to /Ping<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:25:00] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and i remodeled one of 'em<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:25:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and it still looks like the snmp event is on there.<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:25:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; do i need to reload zenoss?<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:25:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:26:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; push changes to the collector for those devices<br/>[21-Jun-2010 13:26:10] &lt;rmatte&gt;

you can do apt-get install or aptitude install<br/>[21-Jun-2010 15:55:08] &lt;Zfield&gt; is it possible to install that to other distros?<br/>[21-Jun-2010 15:55:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; I would imagine you could if you really wanted to<br/>[21-Jun-2010 15:55:29] &lt;Zfield&gt; whats the diff? same command, or is it a different program?<br/>[21-Jun-2010 15:55:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; but generally it's a good idea to just stick with whatever a given distro uses<br/>[21-Jun-2010 15:55:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; aptitude is more dependency aware than apt-get from what I've heard<br/>[21-Jun-2010 15:56:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; but they essentially do the same thing<br/>[21-Jun-2010 15:56:13] &lt;cmw&gt; rmatte: Setup / configuration of Zenoss for a NY based company<br/>[21-Jun-2010 15:56:49] &lt;rmatte&gt;

Quick question. Will a 32Bit Ubuntu with PAE support be enough, for Zenoss to access all the RAM, or will it be limited to 4GB?<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:17:57] &lt;Jesper&gt; I ask because at the moment we have a 64bit Ubuntu installed, but it's a pain in the beeeep, because of various 64bit issues with Dell OMSA, Oracle clients, etc.<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:18:25] &lt;Jesper&gt; So we were wondering if it wouldn't just be easier to install a 32bit version with PAE support?<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:18:33] * Simon4 tries to remember<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:18:49] &lt;Simon4&gt; it won't be Zenoss specifically, it's an OS thing<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:19:37] &lt;Jesper&gt; yea, I guess the individual Zenoss processes never get near to the 4GB barrier<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:19:46] &lt;Simon4&gt; heh<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:19:50] &lt;fragfutter&gt; go for 64bit. you can run all 32bit apps via multilib. with a 32bit system you can access all 6GB but single process is limited to 2GB. A core of zenoss is zope, which likes ram.<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:19:55] &lt;Jesper&gt; so it would be up to the OS to hand out ram for the specific processes<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:20:09] &lt;Jesper&gt; hmm ok<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:20:21] &lt;Simon4&gt; other option is to run 64 bit for zenoss, then have a 32 bit collector which hosts the horrible clients<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:20:26] &lt;Simon4&gt; which is best of both worlds<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:21:00] &lt;fragfutter&gt; oh and pae has a slight performance impact for huge programs.<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:21:15] &lt;fragfutter&gt; (context switching of the kernel gets more complicated)<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:21:19] &lt;Jesper&gt; Simon4: on multiple servers/boxes?<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:21:25] &lt;Jesper&gt; fragfutter: ok<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:24:26] &lt;fragfutter&gt; you can install a 32bit and a 64bit python on the same machine. but it's a bit of work<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:28:05] &lt;Jesper&gt; hmm ok, well the biggest problem is not direclty related to Zenoss, it runs just fine on the 64bit Ubuntu we have now. It's the other programs like Dell OMSA and Oracle and others like it, thats difficult to get running.<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:28:30] &lt;fragfutter&gt; you should be able to run them as 32bit programs.<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:30:00] &lt;fragfutter&gt; i had no issues with dell and 64bit. but i never installed the full omsa. only some parts of the snmp agents that i pulled out of the rpms.<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:30:51] &lt;Jesper&gt; yea, we would like to be able to check raid, fans, heat, etc.<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:32:51] &lt;fragfutter&gt; this is all in the snmp, but it has been a two years since i last had a dell. I made my custom rpm with the parts i needed four years ago so i don't remember anything<br/>[24-Jun-2010 02:34:08] &lt;Jesper&gt; heh yea, last time I messed around with it was around that time as well.<br/>[24-Jun-2010 08:31:46] &lt;fragfutter&gt; how often will zenoss monitor a process? i have a process, zenoss says its fine, but checking on the machine i have no process with this name<br/>[24-Jun-2010 08:38:39] &lt;fragfutter&gt; and why is zenoss removing os-processes if i remodel the device?<br/>[24-Jun-2010 08:39:06] &lt;Simon4&gt; if it's removing them when you remodel the device, it means the modeller isn't finding the process at model time<br/>[24-Jun-2010 08:39:43] &lt;fragfutter&gt; Simon4: that would be bad if i restart a service the same time as zenoss is modelling, it will loose it for the next 12h<br/>[24-Jun-2010 08:40:01] &lt;Simon4&gt; fragfutter: yeah.. you can lock processes to stop that happening<br/>[24-Jun-2010 08:40:21] &lt;fragfutter&gt; ok.<br/>[24-Jun-2010 08:41:27] &lt;fragfutter&gt; so i now created a new process class, with regex=vim, remoddeled a device, i found a vim abd added it to the device, now i quit the vim i had open for this purpose and wait...<br/>[24-Jun-2010 08:42:02] &lt;Simon4&gt; just do a ps -ef |grep vim<br/>[24-Jun-2010 08:42:09] &lt;Simon4&gt; to check that some other process does't match that regex<br/>[24-Jun-2010 08:42:19] &lt;fragfutter&gt; yeah, i know that<br/>[24-Jun-2010 08:42:32] &lt;fragfutter&gt;

maybe your are one of those strange french pirates? heard they are mighty crazy<br/>[25-Jun-2010 08:57:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, I do speak french<br/>[25-Jun-2010 08:57:27] * rmatte shrugs<br/>[25-Jun-2010 08:57:29] &lt;rmatte&gt;

captain on deck!<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:09:48] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; lol<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:09:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; at ease<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:10:09] &lt;cgibbons&gt; arrr!<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:11:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; !!!!<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:13:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; howdy folks!&#160; so rmatte i'd like to take a look at these odd IP up events... but we don't have to tackle that right away.&#160; i think i have a couple of easy ones.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:13:33] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; first, i'd like to remove the threshold for utilization events - but just for my devices @ CORP.&#160; i kinda like having the thresholds for the branch devices.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:13:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; this is where i got into trouble with my templates in the first place<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:14:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; should i make a local template for the device i don't want the threshold on, or what is the preferred method?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:14:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; you can't do that, you'd have to make a local copy of the template on every interface of every device<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:14:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; the solution in this case is a transform<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:14:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; what event class do the utilization events come in for<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:14:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:15:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; and what does the event summary look like when they do?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:15:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; serial interfaces for the most part<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:15:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; no<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:15:16] &lt;rmatte&gt; event class<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:15:21] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:15:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; /Perf/Network or what<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:15:34] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; d'oh<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:15:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; I need to know what class to apply the transform to<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:15:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; "/Perf/Interface"<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:15:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; I also need to see an example of the event summary for one of those events<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; and I need to know how you grouped those devices, are they all in the same location organizer?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:09] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; 36179 packets input<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; der<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; if so, what is the location organizer called?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:18] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; they're all in /CORP<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; example of summary?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; "threshold of high utilization exceeded: current value 57415.37"<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; is the summary<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:17:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; gimme a min<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:18:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; np<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:18:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; thanks rmatte <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:18:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; you're my zenoss go-to guy haha<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:19:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; go to /Events/Perf/Interface<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:20:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; select More -&gt; Transform from the menu<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:20:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; http://pastebin.com/kU7kHsPL<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:20:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; paste that transform in and save<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:22:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:22:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; and that's it that's all<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:22:43] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i just cleared the existing events<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:22:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; you won't see any more for CORP<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:22:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; cool!<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:23:06] &lt;fragfutter&gt; http://pastebin.com/zqidXWE7<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:23:22] &lt;fragfutter&gt; not using re will get you a slight performance increase<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:23:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; fragfutter: your second line is flawed<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:23:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; use if '/CORP' in evt.Location:<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:23:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/silly.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:23:56] &lt;fragfutter&gt; it might be that if you anchored your matching patterns, then it compiles down to the same speed<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:25:45] &lt;fragfutter&gt; rmatte: if i didn't make a typo it's fine<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:26:26] &lt;fragfutter&gt; but speedwise it should be the same as two ifs. only the re part will slow it.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:28:08] &lt;nzle&gt; I changed the name of a template associated with a host, while editing it, and now it doesnt show on the hosts template screen.&#160; Where did it go and how do I get it back??<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:30:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; fragfutter: nah, I was commenting on the startswith on the second line<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:30:49] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nzle, the names of templates are case sensitive, and also needing to match exactly to the type of interface you're trying to filter<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:30:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; if he had a second location organizer that started with CORP it would hit that too<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:32:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; http://pastebin.com/eqsY1EB4<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:32:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; I think that's the most efficient<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:32:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, hopefully another easy one.&#160; i put all of our ATMs in a sub-location organizer.&#160; none of them are showing up on the map, is there something special i have to do?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:32:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm just a chronic regex user<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:32:53] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; should i change the transform to that then?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:33:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: they won't show up on the main map if they are in a sub organizer<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:33:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; the only way to see them on the map is to click on the parent organizer's dot on the map<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:33:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; then that will drill down to them<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:33:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah... i see.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:33:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; otherwise they need to be in their own parent organizer(s)<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:33:30] &lt;nzle&gt; I was defining a template for a nagios plugin.&#160; and several graphs.&#160; When I changed the name of the template, it appears to have all just disappeard.&#160; no graphs on the hosts perf tab any more either.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:33:37] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i'm using the sub organizer in a way that was not intended.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:34:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; nzle: you need to rebind the template<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:34:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; nzle, change the name of the template back, see if it fixes it.&#160; like i said, templates are very sensitive to what you name thenm.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:34:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; them<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:34:40] &lt;nzle&gt; If I cant find the template, how can I change it back?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:34:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; nzle: go to the templates tab for that device class, then select bind templates from the menu<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:34:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; hold down ctrl and select all the ones you need<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:34:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; then click save<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:34:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; and you'll see the graphs again<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:35:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; renaming templates probably messes up bindings<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:35:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; how can you not "find" the template if you just rename it?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:35:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; it should be in the exact same spot<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:35:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; just under a new name<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:37:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, these IP up events are nuts.&#160; i have one right now, it says the device is DOWN, but the event is for IP UP...<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:37:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: is there also a clear event?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:37:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i don't see any<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:37:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i have it checked too in the filter<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:37:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; check in event history<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:38:05] &lt;rmatte&gt; and make sure the severity filter is set to view clear events<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:38:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; see if you can find any<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:38:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k 1 sec<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:39:05] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's odd, sometimes zenoss pages load immediately, sometimes they take forever.&#160; if i'm going into a device, it typically takes forever.&#160; if i'm going to the settings or collector page, something that isn't an individual device, it's quick.&#160; i'm hoping it'll get better when i have a dedicated box.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:39:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; it depends on whether or not the server is performing a collector cycle<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:39:44] &lt;rmatte&gt; which will slow the box down<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:39:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:00] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; alright, everything is checked under severity<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; the fact that you don't have a dedicated box for it is a bit horrifying lol<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and i'm looking at the event history for this device<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; oh wait there they are<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; with the number of devices that you're monitoring<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; took a while to pop up<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:20] &lt;rmatte&gt; you must be munching deep in to swap space<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; wtf... they're both for IP up.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:39] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; actually... it's not swapping that badly.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; at least last time i checked it haha<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; ok, so there's a clear event for IP up and a critical event for IP up?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:40:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; so yea there's a clear event for every critical.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:41:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; correct.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:41:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, wow, hmmm<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:41:30] &lt;rmatte&gt; double click on the critical up event<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:41:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; and click to expand the details<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:41:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; k<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:42:06] &lt;rmatte&gt; does it say "zenping" as the agent property?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:43:19] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yes<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:43:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; can you link me to the guide that you used to setup the custom ping monitor (the graphs)?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:43:26] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; sorry took me a while to find it haha<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:44:25] &lt;nzle&gt; rmatte: got it back, thanx<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:44:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; nzle: np<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:51:10] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, finally found it! docs/DOC-2513<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:51:51] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i don't think that has anything to do with my IP up events, but i guess it could...<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:52:15] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm only swapping 3mb of 2055 <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/grin.gif" width="16px"/>&#160; not bad.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:52:17] &lt;rmatte&gt; k, that obviously has nothing to do with the issue, hmmm (just wanted to see if there was a transform or something as part of the steps)<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:52:23] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:52:29] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, i didn't do anything funky like that.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:52:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'm quite stumped, if a dev was around they might be able to shed light on the issue<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:52:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; did you post in the forums/<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:52:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:53:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; load average is abysmal, but hey the RAM actually looks good.&#160; i'm only using just over a gig.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:53:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; no, i have not posted this issue in the forums.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:53:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i'm not really sure how to post it... i guess erroneous critical IP up events.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:53:29] &lt;rmatte&gt;

LOL that we're using SLES?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:55:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; you running any kind of firewall on it?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:55:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; no, just the way SLES is configured by default<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:55:59] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

it's jumping around which is throwing off Zenoss<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:59:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; ah<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:59:47] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i see<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:59:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; that article links to http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=1006427<br/>[25-Jun-2010 09:59:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; which supposedly explains how to fix it<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:00:06] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yep, it's an ESX-i VM...<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:00:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, so there you have it<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:01:01] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; awesome!<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:01:03] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; thanks rmatte<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:01:11] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; we'll see what the server guys say about this haha.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:01:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; If you don't have an ntp daemon on there, that might help a bit<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:02:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; (if you install one I mean)<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:02:24] &lt;rmatte&gt; but ultimately you need to get the problem with vmware itself fixed<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:02:25] &lt;rmatte&gt;

not sure how much they help tho<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:04:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; evidently not much<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:04:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:04:50] &lt;arrrghhh&gt;

you can use that transform on that page temporarily if you want, though that's really just a band-aid<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:05:42] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:05:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; since you're still in testing phase best to just leave it and get it fixed properly<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:05:46] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; that's awesome tho<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:05:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i know the server guys aren't going to like it<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:06:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; meh<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:06:04] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; but it looks like if we use x64 SLES11 we'll be fine.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:06:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; they'll have to suck it up<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:06:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:06:13] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; pretty much<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:13:31] &lt;mistich&gt; good morning<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:14:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; good morning<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:16:30] &lt;mistich&gt; I have a weird problem zenoss all of the sudden seems to be picking up on os process such as if someone leaves a tail running or a mysqldump and adds it to the services is there any way to turn this off or tell it not to find this service again?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:18:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; mistich: well, that just means that it's finding a process that matches regex that you have set in the processes section to be monitored<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:19:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; say you have regex as "ssh", and someone does: tail -f ssh.log<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:19:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; it'll pick up that process<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:19:09] &lt;mistich&gt; yeah didn't see any but will look again<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:19:34] &lt;rmatte&gt; mistich: there has to be something there, Zenoss never just picks processes up on it's own unless it's set to<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:19:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; when you find the process in question, there's an option called "Ignore Parameters"<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:20:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; enable that and it'll only check process names rather than the whole command<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:20:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; (has to be enabled per command)<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:21:10] &lt;mistich&gt; yeah let me check again<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:21:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:35:40] &lt;mistich&gt; ok riddle me this<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:36:21] &lt;mistich&gt; found the mysql process "Ignore Parameters" was set to true but every time I remodeled the name was "/bin/sh"<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:36:30] &lt;mistich&gt; regex was mysql<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:36:58] &lt;mistich&gt; would this cause it to monitor stuff with sh in it<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:37:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; is the actual name of the executable mysql or mysql.bin?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:37:14] &lt;mistich&gt; mysqld<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:37:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; is there more than just /bin/sh?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:37:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd need to see the full command<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:37:41] &lt;mistich&gt; with Ignore Parameters it was just /bin/sh<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:37:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; then the mysql process isn't what's doing it<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:38:00] &lt;rmatte&gt; you sure that's the only one you enabled?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:38:09] &lt;mistich&gt; but when I turn off Ignore Parameters its&#160; /bin/sh /usr/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir=/var/lib/my<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:38:12] &lt;mistich&gt; yes<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:38:26] &lt;mistich&gt; keeps adding a rsync job that get run every night<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:38:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; I see<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:38:56] &lt;mistich&gt; and no rsync in the processes<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:38:59] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, to it /bin/sh is the process and the rest are the parameters, but it shouldn't be picking it up<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:39:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; though I assume that's the process you want to monitor?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:39:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; do you have examples of some of the other commands that it's picking up?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:39:25] &lt;mistich&gt; ah ha<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:39:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; ?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:40:21] &lt;mistich&gt; well if the /bin/sh is the process then it would be monitoring all commands with /bin/sh<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:40:21] &lt;rmatte&gt; you could always set the regex to /usr/bin/mysqld_safe instead<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:40:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; or whatever<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:40:32] &lt;rmatte&gt; well no<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:40:37] &lt;rmatte&gt; not necessarily<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:40:48] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's just picking up that process because it has "mysqld" as part of it<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:41:10] &lt;mistich&gt; yes going to change the regex try that and see what happens<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:41:11] &lt;rmatte&gt; be more specific, instead of making the regex just mysqld make it: /usr/bin/mysqld_safe<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:41:14] &lt;rmatte&gt; k<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:47:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; rmatte, i have one lingering and odd issue.&#160; i can't traceroute.&#160; ping, snmpwalk both work but traceroute does not.&#160; if i ssh to the box, i can do traceroute no problem, so it's in the $PATH.&#160; What else could be wrong?&#160; I tried putting the full /usr/sbin/traceroute path in the command, but it wouldn't let me save.&#160; kept telling me wrong or blank password when i was entering a password in there...<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:50:28] &lt;mistich&gt; what os?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:50:36] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; SLES10<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:50:36] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: put /manage after the URL and change it there<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:51:12] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; woah<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:51:17] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; never seen that zope interface before<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:51:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; /zport/dmd/userCommands/traceroute/manage<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:51:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's the zope management interface<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:51:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; click on the properties tab in the top right<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:51:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; that password authentication thing is annoying<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:51:54] &lt;rmatte&gt; so I end up using zope management now to change settings<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:51:55] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:51:58] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; doesn't seem to work quite right.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:52:07] &lt;rmatte&gt; yeh, it's buggy as all hell<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:52:09] &lt;rmatte&gt; epic fail<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:52:10] &lt;rmatte&gt; lol<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:52:14] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; isn't the zope management going away in v3?&#160; or at least having a diminished role?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:52:31] &lt;mistich&gt; traceroute -I has to have setuid to run as zenoss user<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:52:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's what I'm told, but if they don't fix that password authentication so that it actually works I shall flip<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:52:52] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; yea, that would be... unfortunate.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:53:08] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i was looking forward to using the new interface right away, but it sounds like i should wait.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:53:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; why traceroute -I?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:53:25] &lt;mistich&gt; has to have root privilege to run<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:53:57] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; if I su to the zenoss user on the box<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:54:02] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; i can run traceroute without any issues.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:54:22] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; and now traceroute works that i put in the full /usr/sbin path.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:54:24] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; go figure<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:54:25] &lt;mistich&gt; but can you run the exact command that the gui is running<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:54:32] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; mistich, to the T<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:54:59] &lt;mistich&gt;

traceroute -I -q 1 -w 2 ${device/manageIp}<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:55:40] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; it's weird, ping, dns and snmpwalk worked fine out of the box.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:55:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; well it executes those commands as the zenoss user<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:55:45] &lt;arrrghhh&gt; traceroute, not so much.<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:55:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; so it shouldn't be any different<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:55:58] &lt;rmatte&gt; arrrghhh: you installed with the stack installer yes?<br/>[25-Jun-2010 10:55:59] &lt;mistich&gt;

Alright<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:28:12] &lt;rmatte&gt; why don't you just use Zenoss' built in process monitoring to monitor ssh?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:28:28] &lt;mray&gt; or port monitoring?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:28:45] &lt;forsberg&gt; port should be fine, just turn the 22 to active<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:28:53] &lt;Zekniqlos&gt; we are bringing over a bunch of custom scripts, and to test the process I wanted to start with something more basic<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:31:09] &lt;forsberg&gt; turn 22 to active = set monitor to true ;&gt;<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:31:43] &lt;Zekniqlos&gt; well, we have a script that looks through log files for 500 errors, and returns fail/pass depending if it's there<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:32:03] &lt;Zekniqlos&gt; so I was slowly getting to that<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:32:50] &lt;forsberg&gt; the most basic/easiest way i found in zenoss, is to report values you can graph, and then make threshold to give alerts, like in return 0 if nothing is wrong and 1 if something is wrong<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:32:53] &lt;mray&gt; Zekniqlos: hmm&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; I'd like that script.&#160; I was thinking about writing something like that myself<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:33:09] &lt;mray&gt; I was going to graph the various 50x errors<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:33:27] &lt;mray&gt; but I was wondering what the best way to preserve my place in the log files would be<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:33:54] &lt;mray&gt; plus you have to account for logrotate<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:34:03] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd just create a placeholder file<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:34:05] &lt;Zekniqlos&gt; right, I'll take a quick look at it<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:34:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; .whatever.log.placeholder<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:34:29] &lt;forsberg&gt; cant you just tail the log file ?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:34:34] &lt;forsberg&gt; and take out what you need?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:34:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; forsberg: yes you can, but you need to know where you left off the last time so that you're not repeating data<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:34:51] &lt;Zekniqlos&gt; forsberg: thanks, that make sense. SSH up = 0 down = 1, if 1 alert<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:34:56] &lt;rmatte&gt; since you're only going to be checking it every 5 mins<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:35:08] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you can to graph the data that occured after the data that you last graphed<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:35:10] &lt;forsberg&gt; yeah Zekniqlos, with max threshold on 0 you will get alert as soon as the value is over<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:35:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; hence the placeholder file<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:35:16] &lt;forsberg&gt; yes right<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:35:22] &lt;forsberg&gt; you need to gather the info somewhere, rmatte<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:35:45] &lt;rmatte&gt; either that or store the line that you're on as a datasource<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:35:50] &lt;rmatte&gt; and use it when executing the script<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:35:55] &lt;forsberg&gt; jup jap<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:36:04] &lt;forsberg&gt; yes even<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:36:22] &lt;rmatte&gt; but when the script file rolls over you'd have to automatically account for that<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:36:23] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: interesting thought<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:36:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; wouldn't be too difficult<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:36:47] &lt;rmatte&gt; erm, when the log file rolls over I meant to say<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:36:57] &lt;forsberg&gt; but hmmm ive seen some perl module to tail file, used for postfix or bind stats hmmmm<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:37:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; forsberg: yeh, but that probably just collects overall stats<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:37:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; forsberg: in this case you would only want the stats during each 5 minute collection period<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:38:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; forsberg: and the script would have to run once every 5 minutes, not just continuously tail the file<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:39:15] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: how do you query the value in the data source?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:39:30] &lt;mray&gt; rmatte: I assume you mean to keep the last line number, but how do you get it back?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:39:51] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct...<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:40:04] &lt;forsberg&gt; well it was working like it would continuously keep track of the numbers and every 5 minutes you would get the difference from 5 minutes ago, as i remember it, so you could like keep track of how many rejections pr whatever or was it bind requests.. hehe but yeah ok i think i get it ;&gt;<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:40:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; mray: one sec, I just want to check something before answering lol<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:41:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; ${dev/getRRDValue('dataSourceName')} might work<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:41:43] &lt;rmatte&gt; or something similar<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:42:28] &lt;rmatte&gt; to pass the value to the script when running it<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:43:38] &lt;rmatte&gt; actually hold up, it will be different but not too different...<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:43:48] &lt;mray&gt; still have to account for logrotate...<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:44:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's really easy to do<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:44:12] &lt;mray&gt; I'm just trying to think how to get this into something that can be run across the wire, rather than have a script on the remote box<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:44:29] &lt;rmatte&gt; just add something that checks the amount of lines in the file on run, and if it's lower than the number that it gets from the datasource, start from the top<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:44:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; although it might lose a bit of data because of the rotation<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:44:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; so you might have to do something a bit more clever<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:44:52] &lt;mray&gt; ahh, but you have to go and check the .1 file as well<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:44:57] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:45:00] &lt;mray&gt; and if logs are rotating fast enough, the .2<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:45:01] &lt;rmatte&gt; which wouldn't be rocket science<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:45:23] &lt;rmatte&gt; check it from the last line number to the bottom, then carry on in the new file and output the new line number<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:45:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; but yeh, one sec and I'll have the exact variable for you to use to pass the line number from the rrd<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:45:49] &lt;mray&gt; right, but this is getitng complicated for something to run over ssh -c<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:47:46] &lt;rmatte&gt; well, a bit<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:49:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; bingo<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:49:18] &lt;rmatte&gt; something like:<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:49:31] &lt;rmatte&gt; ${dev/getRRDValue?dsname=cpu5min}<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:49:33] &lt;mray&gt; hmmm, I'd probably just write it as a bash or python script to live on the remote box, just to make sure all the edge-cases where covered<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:49:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; replace cpu5min with the name of the datasource and it'll work<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:49:49] &lt;mray&gt; nice trick<br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:49:53] &lt;rmatte&gt; <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[30-Jun-2010 12:53:17] &lt;rmatte&gt;

top 10 by availability, cpu, memory, top interfaces by utilization, errors, that sort of stuff<br/>[30-Jun-2010 13:03:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; I'd use rrdcache to keep it quick<br/>[30-Jun-2010 13:03:55] &lt;rmatte&gt;

If I instead set those thresholds such that they dont trigger and use the performance data to set zenoss data point thresholds, then does the OK returned by the plugin get ignored, or do I need to change the script to ret<br/>[30-Jun-2010 13:20:34] &lt;nzle&gt; urn Unknown if no -c and -w parameters are given?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 13:21:33] &lt;rmatte&gt; nzle: the OK won't matter, it's all about the exit code when the script terminates<br/>[30-Jun-2010 13:21:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; have it exit normally instead of exit 1 or exit 2 and it'll work fine<br/>[30-Jun-2010 13:22:16] &lt;nzle&gt; so since it will exit 0, the only thresholds in play are those generated by zenoss on the perf data.<br/>[30-Jun-2010 13:22:34] &lt;nzle&gt;

yeah I tired that and it didn't seem to take the 1st time&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;testing again<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:52:32] &lt;st3v3o&gt; why does the model remover added IPservices&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;.because it can't find them with a port scan ?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:56:26] &lt;rmatte&gt; st3v3o: if locking is applied it won't remove it, so you must have done something wrong<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:56:41] &lt;rmatte&gt; it removes it because it's not seeing it as being active via snmp<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:56:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; it's not actually doing a port scan to my knowledge<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:57:02] &lt;rmatte&gt; the port scan plugin for that is actually broken right now, waiting on it to get patched<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:57:27] &lt;st3v3o&gt; ok so portscan plugin is only used in combo with ssh &#226;&#8364;&brvbar;but broke right now ..gotcha<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:57:49] &lt;rmatte&gt; nah, doesn't have to be used with ssh<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:57:52] &lt;rmatte&gt; it just calls on nmap<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:57:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; but like I said, broken<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:58:04] &lt;rmatte&gt; the snmp plugin is what's used by default<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:58:09] &lt;st3v3o&gt; oh ok<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:58:27] &lt;rmatte&gt; In my experience the ip services monitoring is very flaky<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:58:39] &lt;rmatte&gt; that's why I can't wait for them to fix the nmap plugin<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:58:55] &lt;rmatte&gt; when I did test monitoring with nmap it worked flawlessly<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:59:05] &lt;st3v3o&gt; wait so the IP services checks are all done via SNMP...<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:59:13] &lt;rmatte&gt; correct<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:59:15] &lt;rmatte&gt; at the moment<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:59:16] &lt;st3v3o&gt; bummer<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:59:31] &lt;st3v3o&gt; yeah nmap port check would be MUCH better.<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:59:35] &lt;rmatte&gt; yup<br/>[30-Jun-2010 14:59:37] &lt;st3v3o&gt;

docs/DOC-5905 ZenPack upgrade doc for 3.0<br/>[30-Jun-2010 15:55:57] &lt;cgibbons&gt; yay beta 4<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:01:49] &lt;|rt|&gt; hey guys I just started playing with Zenoss on a test Ubuntu server I have and it seems as though the PATH env isn't setup correctly as it can't find commands for installing zenpacks or snmpwalk etc<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:02:16] &lt;jdross&gt; are you using the zenoss user<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:02:34] &lt;|rt|&gt; but if I look at the processes they are being run by the zenoss user and the zenoss user's path seems to be correct and I'm able to run the commands fine if I su zenoss -<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:03:10] &lt;|rt|&gt; jdross: the problems just seem to be present if I try to run the commands from the web UI<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:03:46] &lt;|rt|&gt; i'm running the 2.5.2 ubuntu 32bit .deb stack installer<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:04:44] &lt;|rt|&gt; looking on trac seems to indicate that there was some similar issues with the .deb stack installers on the 2.5.1 build but the ones I've found are marked as fixed<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:07:20] &lt;|rt|&gt; for instance if I select a device and select run command -&gt; snmpwalk the command errors saying snmpwalk: not found<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:07:43] &lt;|rt|&gt; but if I take the command line that it says it's running and run it on a shell as the zenoss user it works fine<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:14:20] &lt;gwb2351&gt; say you've installed a community zenpack along the lines of "ZenPacks.Ironport.PerformanceGraphs" which provides a template "/Devices/Ironport/Templates/Ironport"<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:14:38] &lt;gwb2351&gt; you've updated the template to add additional SNMP things you care about, graphs, thresholds and the like<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:14:49] &lt;gwb2351&gt; How do you "save" the new template into the zenpack?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:16:22] &lt;mray&gt; gwb2351: docs/DOC-2359<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:21:24] &lt;gwb2351&gt; yup, i was hoping for something easier <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/> for the lazy part of me<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:21:53] &lt;mray&gt; at least it's documented <img height="16px" src="../4.5.6/images/emoticons/happy.gif" width="16px"/><br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:22:08] &lt;gwb2351&gt; what happens if I "layer" zenpacks?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:22:35] &lt;mray&gt; what do you mean?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:22:50] &lt;gwb2351&gt; i.e. i install the "base" ironport and then install a "extended" (which includes more snmp bits, more graphs, some reports)<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:23:14] &lt;mray&gt; hmm&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; I assume the extended one will overwrite the existing one<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:23:28] &lt;mray&gt; since that's how most ZenPack upgrades work<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:24:21] &lt;gwb2351&gt; but they both provide the same template (i.e. the template provided in base is /device/ironport, which i modified for our use, and an "extended" zenpack would just try to install a /device/ironport on top of what was there from the "base" zenpack)<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:24:51] &lt;gwb2351&gt; so if it's a matter of overwriting i have no problems with that.&#160; clunky, but quick, and i can put this to rest<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:25:29] &lt;gwb2351&gt; maybe send an email to the creator of the original and ask if he'd do an "official" update.&#160;

I mean, feel free to ask the author but if he doesn't respond we can still upgrade it<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:28:48] &lt;gwb2351&gt; can't add reports to zenpacks?<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:29:09] &lt;gwb2351&gt; (2.5.2)<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:30:15] &lt;mray&gt; gwb2351: hmm&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; looks like a report organizer can be added, I assume that will include the report<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:30:26] &lt;mray&gt; I think/hope it's cleaned up in 3.0<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:30:54] &lt;gwb2351&gt; yeah, i have tons of "graph reports" for different devices; no need to have *all* of them associated with a zenpack<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:32:23] &lt;mray&gt; hmm&#226;&#8364;&brvbar; 3.0 still has exporting an organizer, but not the report itself<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:32:39] &lt;mray&gt; I'm going to open a ticket<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:32:41] &lt;gwb2351&gt; OK, I see what to do (use a sub organizer of /Graph Reports).&#160; No problem<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:34:05] &lt;gwb2351&gt; that works fine for me (using a sub organizer of /Graph Reports to add reports to zenpack)<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:34:19] &lt;gwb2351&gt; we've just been lazy and creating them at the top-level willy nilly<br/>[30-Jun-2010 16:47:23] &lt;mray&gt;
