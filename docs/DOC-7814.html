its waiting for fds 6,7, and 9 to become available, may want to look at your iowait in top<br/>[01-Jul-2010 08:58:56]&#160; interesting - it's data.fs<br/>[01-Jul-2010 08:59:00]&#160; and some log files<br/>[01-Jul-2010 08:59:02]&#160;

that sounds scary<br/>[01-Jul-2010 09:30:09]&#160; so when you start it normally it dies, but when you run in debug it stays up?<br/>[01-Jul-2010 09:30:20]&#160; oh on<br/>[01-Jul-2010 09:30:30]&#160; when I run strace zenhub -v10<br/>[01-Jul-2010 09:30:53]&#160; it seems to keep going as far as I can tell, but if I start the daemon - which is set at debug logging - it crashes<br/>[01-Jul-2010 09:31:34]&#160;

mmm, this is a new install of EL5.4_64<br/>[01-Jul-2010 09:47:51]&#160; I'll check<br/>[01-Jul-2010 09:48:18]&#160; Yeah, there have been some 'updates', so a couple of new features have been added, IIRC<br/>[01-Jul-2010 09:50:09]&#160; the old server was EL5.4 but 32 bit<br/>[01-Jul-2010 09:55:22]&#160; I've got a uniform fleet of 25 systems monitored through Zenoss and 4 of the 25 are showing 900% utilization of the /boot file system.&#160; I've checked the systems and the /boot file systems are not utilized above 15%.&#160; I've also checked snmpwalk output for the systems and the numbers reported there are correct.<br/>[01-Jul-2010 09:55:45]&#160; Seems like something is getting screwed up in Zenoss for these 4 systems and I'm not sure where to poke around.&#160; Anyone have any suggestions?<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:00:08]&#160; I will suggest to make a backup copy of the RRD files, then blow them away in the $ZENHOME/perf/Devices/ directory and see if the RRD files are a bit off<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:01:04]&#160; Welcome to another Zenoss Developer IRC Session, kells is on deck today and other Zenoss devs are in the channel<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:01:17]&#160; The model might also be messed up<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:01:25]&#160; Oh! SNMP, right<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:01:53]&#160; yes, snmp<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:02:15]&#160; I don't really care about the data that's been collected so far, so I can just delete it all without backing it up.<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:02:53]&#160; SNMP data collection works strictly off of index numbers, btw. So whatever the index was determined to be from the last model is what zenoss thinks is going on.&#160; So the model (ie what is the max size) can be different than what zenpersnmp collects (ie the entry and snmp index X is pointing to a different filesystem)<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:03:20]&#160; So hence you can get strange numbers occasionally from the SNMP agent if the model and the collection part are out of sync<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:03:31]&#160; Try running zenmodeler again first<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:03:39]&#160; I've re-modeled the system several times<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:04:41]&#160; Check the snmp indxe for the boot filesystem, and then compare it against the table order to make sure that what the device says is at /boot and then see what zenperfsnmp run -v10 -d device --showdeviceresults says is coming back at that OID<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:05:36]&#160; I'm making the somewhat safe assumption that /boot isn't insanely huge (like 3TB) and is an easily representable 32-bit number<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:06:22]&#160; Yes, that's correct, /boot is ~200MB<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:06:30]&#160;

Ill have to look through that, because I was considering writing it myself anyway since i couldnt find one<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:23:09]&#160; jdross: I'm happy to answer questions<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:23:33]&#160; currently from my limited experience it seems you need a command per component, which is a bit wasteful when the command in question returns the data for all components anyway<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:24:17]&#160; kells?<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:24:36]&#160; That's currently a limitation of the parser format atm :(<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:24:53]&#160; If we're talking about subcomponents, the story is a little different, of course<br/>[01-Jul-2010 10:25:38]&#160;

its nice, i like it alot<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:27:04]&#160; I jush wish the webUI was a little more friendly, and that it could monitor ESXi hosts<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:27:56]&#160; i saw a zenpack for it, and it doesnt install right<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:28:24]&#160; bad directorys or somthing<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:30:13]&#160; Scientific Linux actually<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:30:34]&#160; I've not tried ESXi hosts - we use KVM which is built into EL5.4<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:30:57]&#160; I am fighting with that -&#160; but only because I don't want to use the device class /Devices/libverthost/kvm<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:32:03]&#160; hehe<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:39:27]&#160; hi everyone, I'm having a newbie problem :$<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:39:43]&#160; I'm having timeout in snmo<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:39:45]&#160; snmp*<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:41:19]&#160; in /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf I have: createuser IMNEWBIE MD5 THISISSECRET DES PRIVPASS<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:41:45]&#160; and: rwuser IMNEWBIE<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:42:52]&#160; I'm trying to probe with: snmpwalk -v 3 -a md5 -A THISISSECRET -u IMNEWBIE myserver.com<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:43:15]&#160; what do I miss?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:43:29]&#160; oh, and the error is: snmpwalk: Timeout<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:43:40]&#160; chachan, can you snmpwalk the entire device?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:44:59]&#160; arrrghhh, what do you mean?, do it in the snmp server?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:45:40]&#160; no...<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:45:47]&#160; I can do it on localhost<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:45:56]&#160; from the zenoss server<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:46:41]&#160; I'm doing from zenoss server and it doesn't work, but localhost it's working<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:46:53]&#160; is*<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:47:03]&#160; snmpwalk the entire device from the zenoss server<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:47:54]&#160; so "snmpwalk -v1 -c&#160; system<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:48:02]&#160; although you probably don't need the "system" at the end<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:48:14]&#160; and replace the &lt;&gt; items<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:48:19]&#160; w/o the brackets<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:48:31]&#160; ok, let me see<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:50:09]&#160; Timeout: No Response from www.newstogram.com<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:50:19]&#160; firewall issue probably then<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:50:23]&#160; i'm assuming you can ping it<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:50:26]&#160; can you nmap it?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:50:27]&#160; arrrghhh, I open 161 and 162 UDP<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:50:40]&#160; i think 161 needs to be open tcp... not positive tho.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:50:56]&#160; mmm<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:51:18]&#160; I will open it, let me see<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:53:49]&#160; arrrghhh, I stopped the firewall and I still get timeout error :(<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:54:01]&#160; chachan, can you ping the device?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:54:35]&#160; arrrghhh, yes I can, I'll try nmap-ing<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:54:44]&#160; just to see what ports it sees as open<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:54:57]&#160; assuming the ports are open, i would look back to the SNMP config on the server.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:55:45]&#160; 161 and 162 TCP<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:56:01]&#160; I have 162 by UDP :s<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:56:17]&#160; k<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:56:25]&#160; check the SNMP config on the server then<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:56:26]&#160; but, now firewall is down, I don't understand why I still getting timeout error<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:56:49]&#160; you ran that nmap from the zenoss server right?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:56:52]&#160; arrrghhh, what do I need to check=<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:57:07]&#160; chachan, depends on the server, kinda outside the scope of this help room...<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:57:07]&#160; arrrghhh, yes, I do that from Zenoss<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:57:25]&#160; arrrghhh, I understand<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:57:43]&#160; it's on centos<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:57:46]&#160; chachan, basically if you can't even snmpwalk the device, there's something blocking you or some bad config on the server.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:58:16]&#160; even if I can snmpwalk the device locally?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:58:20]&#160; did you set up the community strings correctly?&#160; and you're using the same string for the snmwalk command?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:58:33]&#160; that's why i thought it would've been firewall.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:58:49]&#160; hardware or software, but if nmap shows the port as open...<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:58:57]&#160; but firewall is down<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:59:04]&#160; i guess the other question would be, are you using the default port 161 for snmp?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:59:14]&#160; arrrghhh, yes, I do<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:59:27]&#160; chachan, right but if you can't snmpwalk the device then there's something wrong... not with zenoss, with your network.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 11:59:38]&#160; the community string is still by default<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:00:12]&#160; or with the snmp server<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:00:28]&#160; yes, which would be part of your network...<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:00:35]&#160; my point is, zenoss is not your problem.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:01:02]&#160; arrrghhh, ok, then, thanks a lot for the help, I'll search about it ;)<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:01:07]&#160; np<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:29:22]&#160; arrrghhh, are you there?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:29:26]&#160; yes<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:29:56]&#160; about to go back to the work network tho, so make it quick :P<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:30:03]&#160; when I nmap from zenoss with firewall down, I get "161/tcp&#160;&#160; filtered snmp"<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:30:13]&#160; ok<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:30:31]&#160; filtered?, why if the firewall is down?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:30:44]&#160; hrm<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:30:45]&#160; not sure<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:30:45]&#160; telnet doesn't open :(<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:30:51]&#160; do you have any network equipment between those devices that could be blocking the connection?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:31:23]&#160; rmatte, I don't think so<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:31:31]&#160; well, that's the only other possible explanation<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:31:37]&#160; your ISP may be filtering it...<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:31:39]&#160; unless you don't really have the firewall down<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:31:43]&#160; do you have private lines?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:31:50]&#160; why don't you try explicitly allowing those ports in the firewall config?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:31:52]&#160; rmatte, but zenoss is on VPS, could be datacenter details?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:32:06]&#160; or there's another hardware firewall in the middle.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:32:06]&#160; chachan: It's possible that they block traffic to those ports<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:32:34]&#160; rmatte, yes, I will ask them<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:32:41]&#160; chachan: contact your provider (but add the rules to the firewall first to test)<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:32:44]&#160; arrrghhh, rmatte, thanks for the help again<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:32:48]&#160; maybe you just think it's down but it's not really<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:32:49]&#160; np<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:32:52]&#160; np<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:33:02]&#160; rmatte, those rules are still added<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:33:24]&#160; I will ask<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:33:27]&#160; k<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:33:51]&#160; chachan: oh, one last thing to try...<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:33:55]&#160; traceroute -p 161<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:33:57]&#160; to the device<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:34:01]&#160; see where it stops<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:34:07]&#160; ah i forget you can trace to specific ports.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:34:19]&#160; rmatte, that's a good one :) let me see<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:34:28]&#160; arrrghhh, yes, I forget it too<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:34:40]&#160; i shouldn't, considering my role int he company... lol.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:34:45]&#160; :)<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:37:03]&#160; hmmm, you might actually want to do: traceroute -T -p 161<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:37:09]&#160; oh no wait<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:37:15]&#160; nevermind, snmp is UDP<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:37:22]&#160; so yeh, just -p should be fine<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:37:36]&#160; so snmp is udp<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:37:41]&#160; correct<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:37:42]&#160; then you can close that tcp port chachan<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:37:50]&#160; it can be done via TCP, but UDP is the default<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:37:57]&#160; makes sense, i don't know why you would want it to be TCP.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:38:02]&#160; just more overhead<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:38:03]&#160; exactly<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:38:08]&#160; arrrghhh, but nmap says me that 161 is TCP<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:38:28]&#160; chachan, yea i had you open it tho right?&#160; i had you open 161 to both protocols just to be sure.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:38:33]&#160; I didn't touch it, it's by default<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:38:36]&#160; oh<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:38:36]&#160; ok<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:38:48]&#160; i just didn't want to leave stuff open on your network if it doesn't need to be ;)<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:39:07]&#160; chachan: nmap shouldn't even seen your UDP port by default<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:39:12]&#160; unless you ran it with some flags<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:39:33]&#160; rmatte, mmm, ok<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:39:41]&#160; ah didn't even think about that.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:39:56]&#160; i should probably stop trying to diagnose issues when i can't even solve my own haha<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:40:08]&#160; for example, here's an nmap of one of my Zenoss servers which has an SNMP agent on it:<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:40:09]&#160; PORT&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; STATE SERVICE<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:40:09]&#160; 22/tcp&#160;&#160;&#160; open&#160; ssh<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:40:09]&#160; 111/tcp&#160;&#160; open&#160; rpcbind<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:40:09]&#160; 8081/tcp&#160; open&#160; blackice-icecap<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:40:09]&#160; 8180/tcp&#160; open&#160; unknown<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:40:09]&#160; 10000/tcp open&#160; snet-sensor-mgmt<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:40:09]&#160; 20000/tcp open&#160; unknown<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:40:40]&#160; that's just from doing nmap with no flags<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:41:29]&#160; I get it<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:46:38] forsberg is now known as fOrsberg<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:57:00]&#160; hey, does anyone know how to customize the device class a Zenpack is using? I used to be able to just copy / bind the templates, but that doesn't seem to be possible with the Libvert zenpack<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:57:34]&#160; jmp242: pretty sure that pack is hardcoded to use those locations<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:57:43]&#160; jmp242: you'd have to go in and change the code<br/>[02-Jul-2010 12:58:04]&#160; when I say locations I mean device class<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:00:31]&#160; well, I'm up to 14 production Zenoss servers now, yay<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:00:40]&#160; damn<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:03:14]&#160; Ahh, ok.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:03:30]&#160; Am I the only one who finds it a bit annoying for zenpacks to dictate the device classes?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:03:39]&#160; or is there a new best practice there?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:04:21]&#160; jmp242: it's an object based database, so in the xml file you need to specify a location for the class, then any scripts built need to center around that class for the more advanced packs<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:04:30]&#160; I'm sure there would be some way to do it dynamically<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:05:11]&#160; Yea, the reason it's come up is our VM hosts run Linux... I'd like to get all the linux monitoring that works for us under /Devices/Server/Linux<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:05:19]&#160; to also apply to the KVM hosts<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:06:09]&#160; I see<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:06:35]&#160; you could always just copy the Devices template from /Devices/Server/Linux to the one that the ZenPack creates<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:06:50]&#160; same end result, just probably not organizationally what you'd expect<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:07:12]&#160; yea, I would if it would let me.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:07:21]&#160; I'm beginning to wonder if that Zenpack installed correctly<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:07:29]&#160; it's not a choice in the copy to dialog<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:07:53]&#160; what's not a choice?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:08:38]&#160; err /libverthost<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:08:52]&#160; /Server/libvirtHost<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:08:55]&#160; is what it is<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:09:24]&#160; then there are a bunch of subclasses under that<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:09:35]&#160; not that either<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:09:47]&#160; for ESX, KVM, LXC, OpenNebula, OpenVZ, QEMU, UML, VirtualBox, and XEN<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:09:56]&#160; not all of them are functional/tested<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:10:07]&#160; Yea, I know that<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:10:11]&#160; for instance, ESX doesn't work properly<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:10:27]&#160; XEN works the best apparently<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:10:35]&#160; I must have broken it by trying to copy it from zope over<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:10:43]&#160; possibly<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:11:23]&#160; now, the question - would an zenpack uninstall break it more I wonder<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:11:34]&#160; doubt it<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:11:43]&#160; ok, I'll try uninstall / reinstall<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:15:31]&#160; mmm<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:15:38]&#160; well, it cleaned up my database I think<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:16:03]&#160; but I still can't copy anything (in the Zenoss UI) from /Devices/Server/Linux to /Devices/libVirtHost<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:19:44]&#160; hey rmatte you around ?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:19:58]&#160; yup<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:20:13]&#160; lol it seems we all get unofficial support from rmatte<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:20:16]&#160; jmp242: you should be able to copy anything to anything<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:20:35]&#160; arrrghhh: that's what I'm here for lol (well, one of the reasons)<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:20:42]&#160; give and ye shall receive<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:20:46]&#160; haha well we appreciate it.<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:21:05]&#160; some said you might be able to help with the threshold questions<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:21:16]&#160; st3v3o: which questions?<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:21:17]&#160; That is indeed what I would expect<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:22:18]&#160; I'm trying to create a memory threshold for 90%<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:22:49]&#160; ok<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:23:22]&#160; my datapoint is memAvailReal_memAvailReal and i tired the following expression but no luck<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:23:22]&#160; here.hw.totalMemory * .9<br/>[02-Jul-2010 13:23:30]&#160;

then under zCollectorPlugins you can hit the "Edit" link<br/>[05-Jul-2010 09:38:56]&#160; /zport/dmd/Devices/zSortableProperty?prop=zCollectorPlugins<br/>[05-Jul-2010 09:39:59]&#160; and link "add fields" shows all available plugins<br/>[05-Jul-2010 10:07:18]&#160; maybe i'm an idiot, but where is the "Commands tab of the event manager" ?<br/>[05-Jul-2010 10:09:59]&#160; forget it, i *am* an idiot<br/>[05-Jul-2010 10:15:32] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg<br/>[05-Jul-2010 10:42:50]&#160; lol<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:00:08] forsberg is now known as fOrsberg<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:11:32]&#160; hmmm where can I get ZenPacks.zenoss.PreUpgrade30 from?<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:18:11]&#160; pretty sure that's an enterprise only ZenPack<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:18:34]&#160; for now anyways<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:18:44]&#160; If you're an enterprise user talk to Zenoss support<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:18:52]&#160; if not, wait until 3.0 is actually officially released<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:26:08]&#160; ah i see<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:44:16]&#160; hey guys, if i setup 3.0 beta will i be able to upgrade to 3.0 final<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:50:16]&#160; Parabol: in theory yes, but I wouldn't recommend doing that<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:50:41]&#160; Parabol: If you're setting up a prod system, use 2.5.2 for now<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:50:55]&#160; and upgrade to 3.0 or wait for bugfix releases such as 3.0.1 or 3.0.2 before upgrading<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:51:06]&#160; if you're just making a server to mess around on then by all means<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:51:14]&#160; no its for production<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:51:20]&#160; then don't use beta<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:51:23]&#160; that's just dumb lol<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:51:31]&#160; 3.0 seems more polished<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:51:43]&#160; it has a prettier interface yes<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:51:46]&#160; my employer saw a video on youtbue<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:51:51]&#160; dynamic somthing assurance<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:51:52]&#160; but there are underlying bugs<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:51:54]&#160; and hes all omg omg<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:52:04]&#160; there's a reason why it's a beta<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:52:06]&#160; he wants me to scrap the 2.5.2 and setup 3.0 lol<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:52:17]&#160; tell him to hold his horses<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:52:38]&#160; 3.0 will be out soon enough, no point in jumping the gun<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:54:55]&#160; well if we do all this work on 2.5.2<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:55:07]&#160; well, they've fixed some bugs since the last beta and introduced some new ones<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:55:11]&#160; time to make a list and log tickets<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:55:31]&#160; and then have to throw it all out<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:55:46]&#160; because we have to do all this work over again<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:56:50]&#160; why would you have to throw it all out?<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:56:53]&#160; it's called an upgrade<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:56:56]&#160; the work carries over<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:57:12]&#160; so you can upgrade to 3.0 from 2.5<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:57:13]&#160; all that changed is the interface, the underlying functionality is still very much the same from the old interface to the new one<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:57:20]&#160; of course<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:57:29]&#160; you can always upgrade from previous versions to newer ones<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:57:35]&#160; thats odd<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:57:41]&#160; how is that odd lol?<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:57:42]&#160; you can go from 2.5 to 3, but not from 3 beta to 3 final?<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:57:49]&#160; well who the hell makes somthing that does that<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:57:54]&#160; I'm not saying that you can't...<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:57:58]&#160; oh okay<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:58:05]&#160; so an upgrade from 2.5 to 3.0 is not recommended either<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:58:07]&#160; I'm saying that they don't really test that, and that it's inadvisable to do that<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:58:17]&#160; which means the answer is you cant upgrade<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:58:22]&#160; and im back to my original problem<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:58:27]&#160; an upgrade from 2.5 to 3.0 is advisable once 3.0 is actually officially released<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:58:29]&#160; it's not released<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:58:32]&#160; it's a beta<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:58:38]&#160; i live on betas :P<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:58:41]&#160; my phone runs nightly builds lol<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:58:48]&#160; that's horribly bad practice for production systems<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:58:56]&#160; but if that's how you do things, have at e'r<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:59:18]&#160; nono<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:59:20]&#160; not work, personal<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:59:24]&#160; i always go for betas at home :)<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:59:36]&#160; you WILL be able to upgrade cleanly from 2.5 to 3.0 once it's released<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:59:38]&#160; patience<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:59:39]&#160; lol<br/>[05-Jul-2010 11:59:55]&#160; thats all i needed :) you're the man<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:00:01]&#160; thanks lol<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:02:50]&#160; 110% the man<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:03:07]&#160; neat product tho, once i get this all setup this hsould be a good free alternative to ipmonitor<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:03:43]&#160; yeh, it is a good product<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:06:06]&#160; solarwinds does have fancier display of stats and stuff though<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:06:46]&#160; Zenoss is extremely extendable though, you can do almost anything with it<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:08:07]&#160; its looking that way<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:08:14]&#160; i'm trying to wrap my head around it :)<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:08:20]&#160; this is only my 3rd day with the product<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:08:24]&#160; i've got WMI working, SNMP working<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:08:35]&#160; working on a zenpack that will mmonitor your SSL certs<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:08:37]&#160; for experation :D<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:08:44]&#160; talking to the developer now<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:08:55]&#160; had some problems getting it installed, now that its installed its not showing up<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:09:55]&#160; ah<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:10:20]&#160; that's one thing that'll be interesting for the 3.0 upgrades, migrating the ZenPacks properly<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:10:44]&#160; which is why I'm advising people to wait for the official release so that more experienced users can come up with an effective solution<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:11:23]&#160; I'm in the same boat as you, I'll have 14 Production Zenoss servers to upgrade from 2.5 to 3.0<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:11:47]&#160; so I'll be doing a lot of testing to get the absolute best method before performing the actual upgrades<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:12:11]&#160; Zenoss can be a bit testy<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:43:51]&#160; hmmm, the IpService monitoring seems to have greatly improved in 3.0<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:44:10]&#160; excellent<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:45:12]&#160; I have a question, been reading manuals/tutorials over the weekend with no luck :[<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:46:59]&#160; We have a script that returns the 1 / 0 with the threshold being 0 clear and 1 'somethings up'. We want to return a custom string to the event from the script though. IE: "please check apache.broken in /var/tmp/" instead of the default event message for thresholds reached "threshold of rsi.https-500-log.monitor exceeded: current value 1.00"<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:47:22]&#160; pretty sure that's whatever you put before the | in nagios format<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:47:34]&#160; THIS IS THE MESSAGE|<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:47:37]&#160; or whatever<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:47:55]&#160; the command datasource section of the admin guide should explain that<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:48:45]&#160; nice, so I can't find anywhere to configure alerts in the 3.0 interface<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:48:46]&#160; Thanks rmatte, I'll have a look<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:48:49]&#160; np<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:51:57]&#160; hmmm, no developers around today<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:51:58]&#160; shame<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:52:12]&#160; I wanted to run some stuff by them to make sure they are actually bugs before logging them<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:52:20]&#160; guess I'll just log them anyways<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:56:35]&#160; ah, I see why I couldn't see alerting rules<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:56:47]&#160; admin can't modify alerting rules for other users anymore, which is bad<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:57:02]&#160; woah<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:57:04]&#160; that's very bad<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:57:09]&#160; yup<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:57:19]&#160; I'll add it to my list of bugs to log<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:57:22]&#160; I already have about 10<br/>[05-Jul-2010 12:57:37]&#160;

Hey your fave guy is back :)<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:21:07]&#160; so, under performance tab, CPU graph shows up, RAM does not<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:21:12]&#160; but under OS i can see free ram and such<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:22:35]&#160; for what type of device?<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:23:13]&#160; sorry<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:23:16]&#160; windows server 2008 R2 x64<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:23:23]&#160; ONLY THE LATEST AND GREATEST FOR ME<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:23:28]&#160; being monitored via WMI?<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:23:47]&#160; yup<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:23:51]&#160; under OS stats show up<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:23:52]&#160; check the wmi device template to see if it even supports monitoring memory utilization<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:23:55]&#160; that may not have been added<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:24:01]&#160; it does support it<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:24:03]&#160; it works<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:24:08]&#160; just under Perf the graph is broken<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:24:12]&#160; not as in all zeros<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:24:19]&#160; how is it broken?<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:24:20]&#160; as in , a little magnifying glass shows up lol<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:24:26]&#160; like its not there<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:24:29]&#160; but CPU one shows up just fine<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:24:38]&#160; when did you add that device?<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:24:42]&#160; 3 days ago<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:24:54]&#160; ok, you'll want to talk to bigegor about that when he's around<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:25:03]&#160; I don't do any WMI monitoring with that pack so I have no idea<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:25:19]&#160; it's probably something simple to fix<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:26:50]&#160; alright<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:27:09]&#160; you can also check the forum to see if anyone has had similar issues<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:27:15]&#160; and if not, post there and see what responses you get<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:27:20]&#160; that's the best I can suggest<br/>[05-Jul-2010 13:41:58]&#160;

the issue is in the Perf tab, the RAM graph doesnt show up at all<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:24:42]&#160; my CPU one is broken too, which im working on that, it shows up but theres some RRD error<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:29:05]&#160;

then select bind templates from the dropdown<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:36:35]&#160; then hold down ctrl and select the templates that you want<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:36:57]&#160; in this case you want WMIDevice<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:37:46]&#160; thanks, rmatte ;)<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:39:45]&#160; um WMI isnt in that bo<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:39:46]&#160; box*<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:40:06]&#160; theres only one entry, and its the classes "path"<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:40:12]&#160; so /servers/windows/terminal services/<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:40:19]&#160; and the rest is cut off, what should be in tehre<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:41:21]&#160; and in the list of availible templates I dont see WMI<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:41:50]&#160; did you not install the WMI Performance Template ZenPack?<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:42:01]&#160; performance, no i got the WMI data zenpack though<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:42:01]&#160; Just installing the WMI Data Source ZenPack alone is not enough<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:42:06]&#160; oooo<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:42:09]&#160; bigegor: i got that<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:42:10]&#160; fail!<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:42:10]&#160; i think<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:42:13]&#160; i'll test it<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:42:21]&#160; the WMI Data Source ZenPack just adds a WMI daemon and the WMI Data Source type<br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:42:31]&#160; you still need to get the other pack to have the pre-built template<br/><span>[05-Jul-2010 14:42:57]&#160; Parabol: Ok, now you have two options: 1. install SNMP Informant (</span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.snmp-informant.com/">http://www.snmp-informant.com/</a><span>) or install WMIDataSource and WMIPerf_Windows ZenPacks</span><br/>[05-Jul-2010 14:43:54]&#160;

but it would be extremely tricky<br/>[08-Jul-2010 08:38:03]&#160; and impractical<br/>[08-Jul-2010 08:39:36]&#160; running python against the dmd, get the interface speed from it, get the last value via rrdvalue and plot it using imlib. i wonder how many cpu cycles this would burn<br/>[08-Jul-2010 08:47:59]&#160;

lol<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:01:05]&#160; I'm surprised someone hasn<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:01:18]&#160; hasn't made an exchange template that works with Egor's WMI Data Source pack<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:04:07]&#160; rmatte yeah it made it worse lol<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:04:36]&#160; i got it, removed the class and readded it, then the zenpack<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:04:41]&#160; and it worked, i dunno<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:04:45]&#160; however, i still cant see cpu Perf graph<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:04:46]&#160; its empty<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:04:56]&#160; and, disk space (total) shows up, but not used<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:05:40]&#160; yeah I'm looking to see if I can use Egor's pack to pull performance data<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:05:55]&#160; it can :)<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:06:01]&#160; the wmi perf pack works very well<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:06:06]&#160; this is a linux box i'm dealing with<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:07:09]&#160; Does anyone know how to retrieve the service key from an event?&#160;

and so is CPU graph<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:07:30]&#160; rmatte not using snmp<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:07:35]&#160; its all SSH and python scripts<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:07:43]&#160; shit its not working<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:07:47]&#160; the graph shows up now<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:07:51]&#160; I see<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:07:51]&#160; but they all say nan%<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:08:08]&#160; eugh, ok, rule of thumb...<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:08:14]&#160; it takes 3 polling cycles for data to start showing up<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:08:18]&#160; aka 15 minutes<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:08:18]&#160; you need to wait at least five minutes before they have enough data.<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:08:25]&#160; have some patience and it'll show up<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:08:25]&#160; oh okay<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:08:30]&#160; :)<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:08:33]&#160; (why someone prefers ssh over snmp, no idea)<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:08:39] * rmatte shrugs<br/>[08-Jul-2010 09:08:44]&#160;

Or model ports with there maximum physical speed not the negotiated one, but i can't find an OID reporting the physical speed.<br/>[09-Jul-2010 06:23:30]&#160; no<br/>[09-Jul-2010 06:24:04]&#160; not unless you override the template which you can do, but I wouldn't advise it.<br/>[09-Jul-2010 06:24:40]&#160; malbon: so there is an oid with the max physical speed?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 06:25:48]&#160; no there isn't sadly<br/>[09-Jul-2010 06:26:23]&#160; why can't you just use the 'speed ' on the ciscos to override the reporting of the actual link speed?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 06:28:19]&#160; malbon: because there are 10k ports and you can plug in anything, anywhere, anytime ;)<br/>[09-Jul-2010 06:28:58]&#160; then increase your model frequency. ;)<br/>[09-Jul-2010 06:29:29]&#160; you could for example have a command against a 'link up' trap from each of your switches. It would also enable you to track system moves.<br/>[09-Jul-2010 06:30:19]&#160; so if you're running a normal office and not a conf centre, the moves and changes people should only be doing &lt;100 per day which is quite easy to plan for in terms of zenoss load.<br/>[09-Jul-2010 06:30:47]&#160; malbon: that was my workaround idea.

cool<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:13:40]&#160; yeh, if they do figure out what it is be sure to let us know<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:13:51]&#160; (I had &gt;70,000 IpServices in the Services bit)<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:14:05]&#160;

ah<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:14:45]&#160; you're supposed to have in the 3-4K range?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:14:57]&#160; not sure, checking now lol<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:15:11]&#160; yeh, 3773 is the default from the looks of it<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:15:18]&#160; under IpService<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:15:28]&#160; first step for me is to get to there, then we'll see what happens<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:15:49]&#160; yup<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:16:11]&#160; hmmm, I'm debating if I want to do coding on my zenoss daemon, or continue with 3.0 beta testing today<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:16:19]&#160; leaning towards the testing to get it out of the way<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:16:41]&#160; oh no, that's what I wanted to try doing, get LDAP working with 3.0<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:16:49]&#160; what are your thoughts on 3.0 so far? I haven't touched it<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:17:01]&#160; interface is nice but there's room for improvement<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:17:24]&#160; rmatte: there is *always* room for improvement :)<br/><span>[09-Jul-2010 10:17:25]&#160;

quite a list<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:17:58]&#160; npmccallum: yeh, I know, but there's some really obvious stuff that could be fixed right now<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:18:15]&#160; npmccallum: mostly usability more than anything, the interface seems quite solid<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:18:20]&#160;

oh, and ZenPack issues<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:18:52]&#160; not sure how you guys are going to be handling that<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:19:05]&#160; are you going to code some sort of live migration or something?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:19:25]&#160;

npmccallum: nice<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:30:19]&#160; is there a way to check whether or not zenoss received these messages?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:30:39]&#160; not if they are being dropped<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:30:51]&#160; if they aren't being dropped then you can check in history<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:30:58]&#160; thanks for the snmp config rmatte :)<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:31:06]&#160; just got off the phone and found it :) hehe<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:31:44]&#160; hmm<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:31:47]&#160; they arent in the history<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:31:53]&#160; who drops messages?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:31:53]&#160; Parabol: no problem, modify it a bit obviously<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:31:57]&#160; the receiving syslogd?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:32:44]&#160; rmatte: actually that was the road we traveled down.&#160; I just updated the ifstated configuration to take action if mysqlping failed as well, adjusting the advskew on each server appropriately<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:33:05]&#160; rmatte: will need to do that for other critical services in the hosting stack as well going forward. :)<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:33:38]&#160; thanks.&#160; I was thinking along the lines of having zenoss down the interface on the device that failed.&#160; I think you're right, and having it closer to the machine is better.<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:34:20]&#160; for sure<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:34:27]&#160; no point in having a middle man if you don't need one<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:34:41]&#160; and with that in mind, death to contracting agencies<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:34:53]&#160; rmatte: agreed :)<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:39:06]&#160; also, with having the script run locally you could have it automatically up the interface once the issue is resolved<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:39:13]&#160; in case it's just a blip or something<br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:40:08]&#160; is it possible zenoss drops messages with a debug priority?<br/><span>[09-Jul-2010 10:44:11]&#160; npmccallum: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/7020#comment:1">http://dev.zenoss.org/trac/ticket/7020#comment:1</a><br/>[09-Jul-2010 10:45:24]&#160;

that made no sense lol<br/>[09-Jul-2010 12:48:32]&#160; right now zenoss logs into my devices, rather then trapping messages<br/>[09-Jul-2010 12:49:43]&#160; you can't send v3 traps to zenoss, it doesn't support em<br/>[09-Jul-2010 12:50:10]&#160; you can send v2 or below though, and they'll turn up under /Unknown in the events view initially<br/>[09-Jul-2010 12:50:37]&#160; so zenoss can only log into snmpv3?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 12:50:49]&#160; yeah, it'll collect from v3<br/>[09-Jul-2010 12:51:04]&#160;

ahhh ok thanks, that saved me from looking for that section even more =)<br/>[09-Jul-2010 12:53:52]&#160; is it a bad practise to have zenoss log into a switch, and also receive traps from the same device?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 12:56:35]&#160; also, how would i enable zenoss to accept traps for the 'boobies' community string?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 13:03:50]&#160; Simon4: is correct<br/>[09-Jul-2010 13:04:09]&#160; Zfield: no, it's best practice to have it polling AND receiving traps<br/>[09-Jul-2010 13:04:13]&#160; traps don't give you performance info<br/>[09-Jul-2010 13:04:36]&#160; they are generally for hardware/software related errors, temperature alerts, etc...<br/>[09-Jul-2010 13:04:45]&#160; you should be using both<br/>[09-Jul-2010 13:05:13]&#160;

I made a Cisco MIBs ZenPack that can be used for Cisco gear<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:05:38]&#160; i do have some cisco, hp, and 2 linksys poe switches<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:05:54]&#160; so im guessing for my linksys switch it isn't as easy as throwing in a community string and clikc ADD<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:06:02]&#160; no idea<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:06:07]&#160; I've never used a linksys switch<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:06:10]&#160; it might be, it might not be<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:06:26]&#160; you'd definitely need to make a custom template for it in Zenoss<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:06:29]&#160; if that's what you mean<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:06:43]&#160; provided they even support snmp<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:06:48]&#160; well i have a SNMP section, it asks for a Recipient IP, notification type: Traps, and notification version<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:07:08]&#160; oh and a community string and port<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:07:08]&#160; right, then specify the IP of the zenoss server, set version to 1 or 2<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:07:15]&#160; set the community string<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:07:19]&#160; ok, did all that<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:07:19]&#160; leave port as default<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:07:26]&#160; is there anything i need to do on the zenoss side?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:07:31]&#160; you'll need to get linksys mibs and install them<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:07:40]&#160; find the mibs, the admin guide explains the rest<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:08:13]&#160; and if you want to monitor cpu/memory or whatever else you need to research what SNMP OIDs to use and create a device template<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:08:17]&#160; ohhhh ok i was confused for a second, i thought i was to install the MIB to the switch which made no sense at all to me<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:08:24]&#160; no<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:08:30]&#160; you install the Mibs in to Zenoss<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:08:32]&#160; using zenmib<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:08:48]&#160; so that it is able to properly translate the traps when they come in<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:08:53]&#160; so the mib is like a decoder ...<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:08:56]&#160; yea what you just said<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:08:58]&#160; gotcha<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:08:58]&#160; yes<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:09:06]&#160; you anwsered my question before i finished =)<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:09:12]&#160; lol<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:09:48]&#160; is windows support also built-in, or would i need a mib for that too?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:09:57]&#160; anyone here use the esx zenpack in 2.5.x? I just upgraded to 3.x as my eval was over and I was bored and now it has all kinds of awesome esx reports<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:09:59]&#160; you need to install Mibs for that<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:10:03]&#160; I wasn't sure if those were in the old one and i just missed them<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:10:06]&#160; and make sure they work before you start doing transforms<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:10:26]&#160; our windows Mibs were installed incorrectly, and now we're up to like 100 transforms that I would have to redo if I installed the Mibs<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:10:35]&#160; so we're kind of screwed in that department at the moment<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:10:36]&#160; lol<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:10:42]&#160; lol<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:11:21]&#160; if you see the trap come in as enterprises. with a bunch of numbers after it, it's not setup properly<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:11:27]&#160; they should come in with meaninful names<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:11:41]&#160; like: snmp trap getOffYourArseAndFixMe<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:12:23]&#160; eugh, 1 more hour then home<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:12:24]&#160;

im looking at the manual, and i'm still clueless where to get the mibs from<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:21:15]&#160; where to get what mibs?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:21:39]&#160; yeah<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:21:53]&#160; and if that makes no sense..... then you know how f***ed i am<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:22:24]&#160; oh wait, mib's arent zenoss specific.. duhhh<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:22:27]&#160; nvm i think im good now<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:22:58]&#160;

I feel a bit guilty considering I'm only monitoring like, 50 devices<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:38:59]&#160; twm1010: solarwinds has the WORST web interface I've ever seen<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:39:19]&#160; twm1010: Changing a text field from "False" to "True" by typing it in is a nightmare<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:39:25]&#160; they apparently haven't heard of dropdowns<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:39:27]&#160; LOL WTF<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:39:29]&#160; u seroius?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:39:33]&#160; very<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:39:41]&#160; I almost died when I saw that after we bought it<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:39:43]&#160; oh I agree, you also can't set maintenance windows without using SQL scripts<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:39:48]&#160; I don't manage it thank god<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:39:54]&#160; though they are trying to dump it on me<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:39:57]&#160; they might as well have made it case sensitive... true would throw an error, where True would be good lol<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:40:02]&#160; for deliberate, defined monitoring of network circuits, its good<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:40:08]&#160; good reporting engine too<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:40:28]&#160; rmatte: if you don't mind me asking, what on earth do you monitor with 14 boxes? :O<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:40:31]&#160; where in zenoss you filter out what you don't want, solarwinds makes you be explicit about what you do<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:40:45]&#160; ashp: we're an MSP, each box has a different client on it<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:40:50]&#160; ahhh<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:40:56]&#160; I used to do managed services stuff at ntt<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:41:04]&#160; some boxes have around 20 devices, the majority have 100+, and 1 has 400+<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:41:12]&#160; we sure as hell didn't have anything as nice as zenoss for monitoring, however<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:41:17]&#160; i have about 200 devices<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:41:18]&#160; hehe<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:41:22]&#160; i worked for some other uk managed services companies<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:41:28]&#160; and each one had an even worse monitoring system<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:41:32]&#160; I'm at over 1000 devices total, and we're honestly just getting started<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:41:36]&#160; with the very worst being tivoli<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:41:51]&#160; we've only been at this for a year, though most of our staff used to work at a big MSP before they got bought out and liquidated<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:41:55]&#160; so we moved over here<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:42:07]&#160; I used tivoli at my last job<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:42:08]&#160; especially considering our sales people kept telling customers that tivoli would 'predict failures in advance'<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:42:11]&#160; those fuckers :/<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:42:13]&#160; pain in the arse<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:42:15]&#160; wish i could do this full time<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:42:23]&#160; dear customers, tivoli can't see the future, sorry<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:42:28]&#160; well, their ticketing system, not their monitoring<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:42:34]&#160; but i'm also the VOIP admin, the exchange admin, the groupwise admin, the NetApp admin, you get the idea<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:42:40]&#160; nice<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:42:57]&#160; we used to get about 10,000 events for tivoli a day, all of which had to be cleared by hand<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:43:05]&#160; I'm the Zenoss admin, otrs admin, ziptie admin, sysadmin of almost anything to do with the monitoring infrastructure<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:43:07]&#160; you could clear them in batches by searching for key words but it was a total nightmare<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:43:25]&#160; plus I do development work<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:43:31]&#160; i'm at a law school so i'm in charge of anything that runs on linux, but we have a tiny baby environment here compared to what i was used to<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:43:39]&#160; hehe<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:43:50]&#160; is ziptie any good? we were talking just this morning about some kind of inventory system<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:43:50]&#160; we have each Zenoss instance feeding in to our ticketing system<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:43:59]&#160; so our techs works out of the ticketing system as their event console<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:44:02]&#160; rmatte: why wasn't I working for YOUR managed services company<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:44:05]&#160; and just go in to Zenoss for troubleshooting<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:44:10]&#160; are there any good open source ticketing systems?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:44:16]&#160; ntt at least had an amazing inventory system, but the rest was mostly manual<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:44:20]&#160; ziptie is no longer supported/developed<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:44:27]&#160; but it's a good system<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:44:42]&#160; they got bought out by the same company that bought the MSP we were working at out<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:45:03]&#160; now it's called network authority and I think they only sell it, no more opensource<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:45:11]&#160; we still use ziptie though, it gets the job done<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:45:17]&#160; and it's free<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:45:30]&#160; it's funny, all the software that does the real heavy lifting for us is open source<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:45:31]&#160; we really do need to look into something for the whole change management/inventory purpose<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:45:37]&#160; rmatte: is the free version still available?<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:45:41]&#160; we have about 100 servers in the entire environment so it's hardly worth anything fancy<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:45:48]&#160; the crap products that they pay tons of money for do almost nothing except look pretty for clients (such as solarwinds)<br/>[09-Jul-2010 14:45:56]&#160;

Hi! is it possible to define a threshold that uses 2 datapoints in the same datasource?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 06:32:03]&#160; i have a gauge of events which have to be processed, and a counter which tracks the latest processed event<br/>[12-Jul-2010 06:32:19]&#160; so on the RRD graph, i see amount of events needing to be processed, and the rate at which events are processed<br/>[12-Jul-2010 06:32:39]&#160; now i want a way to say "alert me when the rate is 0 and pending events &gt; 0'<br/>[12-Jul-2010 06:32:40]&#160; so you only want the threshold to trip if both values go over<br/>[12-Jul-2010 06:33:21]&#160; I just tested and you can select multiple data points when creating a threshold<br/>[12-Jul-2010 06:34:04]&#160; I don't believe you can have different values for the data points though<br/>[12-Jul-2010 06:34:15]&#160; each would need to trip on the same threshold ..<br/>[12-Jul-2010 06:35:14]&#160; ugh<br/>[12-Jul-2010 06:40:14]&#160;

good morning<br/>[12-Jul-2010 08:57:22]&#160; i've got a debian box thats being monitored via SNMP, i've got some OS processes being watched, apache2, mydns and a couple others<br/>[12-Jul-2010 08:57:39]&#160; its showing the status as up, however when i stop mydns it doesnt seem to detect that its stopped<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:00:53]&#160; Parabola: when did you add the processes in to monitoring?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:01:32]&#160; ashp: in my experience, zenoss just relies on snmp, which only includes filesystems which are mounted<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:01:42]&#160; ashp: for what you want, you should probably write your own check<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:02:13]&#160; rmatte: days ago<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:02:23]&#160; Parabola: zenoss process monitoring is very buggy<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:02:31]&#160; rmatte: i know over the weekend i had tested with another box, i dont remmeber which, stopping services and it noticed and emailed<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:02:44]&#160;

Parabola: zenprocess is very finicky, I always restart it after making any kind of changes to process monitoring<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:03:25]&#160; Parabola: if that doesn't work, perform a reindex() and commit() in zendmd<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:03:34]&#160; i dont know what you mean by that<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:03:41]&#160; service restarted<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:03:48]&#160; rmatte: does&#160; it make a difference in flaky-ness if the process is being monitored by SNMP or by command?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:03:51]&#160; you become the zenoss user via ssh, then type zendmd<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:04:00]&#160; and it'll bring you in to a special python shell for zenoss<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:04:05]&#160; then you type reindex()<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:04:07]&#160; and hit enter<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:04:14]&#160; then you type commit() once that finishes<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:04:14]&#160; i despise process monitoring<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:04:16]&#160; and hit enter<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:04:20]&#160;

well, it seems like it works, and then all of a sudden it breaks<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:05:04]&#160; rmatte: what regexp do you normally use to monitor one process?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:05:06]&#160; like "mysqld"<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:05:09]&#160; the problem is that it's way overengineered. zenoss developers/managers think they know better then sysadmins<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:05:36]&#160; yeah the shits not working<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:05:44]&#160; i stopped mysdns and waited about 60 seconds<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:05:46]&#160; refreshed, nothing<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:05:58]&#160; jb: I just use a regex that matches the name<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:06:05]&#160; all people i talk to all say "i want to say: class or device foo should have processes foo and bar". not "let zenoss automatically detect shit which is incorrect and generates incorrect and unreliable alerts"<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:06:06]&#160; "mysqld" in that case<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:06:34]&#160; Dieterbe: I don't find that it detects things that are incorrect<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:06:50]&#160; Dieterbe: it's never going to detect a process that isn't there are long as it's configured correctly<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:07:04]&#160; so this is odd<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:07:07]&#160; it often finds and starts monitoring which you don't care about<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:07:13]&#160; +processes<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:07:19]&#160; under classes &gt; processes , i have them added with the service and the name as the same<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:07:31]&#160; Dieterbe: so you're saying you'd care about those processes on one device but not necessarily on another?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:07:32]&#160; however when i go under the server, it changes the name to the full file path<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:07:45]&#160; rmatte: of course<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:07:54]&#160; Parabola: it's supposed to do that<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:08:07]&#160; so does that mean its seeing the services on the box correctly?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:08:09]&#160; Parabola: the name set in processes is just a regex for locating the processes to monitor<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:08:13]&#160; if its renaming the name to the full path like that<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:08:17]&#160; yes, it does<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:08:25]&#160; okay well it doesnt detect when they stop still<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:08:31]&#160; reindex<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:08:32]&#160; i swear im going to stab somone<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:08:54]&#160; do a reindex as I explained then restart zenprocess again<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:00]&#160; and what you dont get is i cant just do that<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:04]&#160; i dont have SSH on the zenoss VM<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:05]&#160; and make sure you're actually restarting the same process that it detected<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:10]&#160; as its a VM i cant walk over to a KVM<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:15]&#160; and as im on a mac i dont have the vmware console<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:17]&#160; k, you really really need to enable ssh<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:26]&#160; commandline is invaluable when working with zenoss<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:27]&#160; no, they really need to write a working product<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:48]&#160; The product works fine, it just has some quirks<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:53]&#160; then it doesnt work fine<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:58]&#160; i'm not being rude, i like it dont get me wrong<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:09:59]&#160; I use it to successfully monitor tons of processes<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:10:03]&#160; on both windows and linux<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:10:06]&#160; but at the same time im getting yelled at over this<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:10:08]&#160; because it randomly works<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:10:11]&#160; this weekend, it was spot on<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:10:21]&#160; notified me right away, no remediation of course which is STUPID<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:10:23]&#160; but it at least told me<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:10:30]&#160; now it just doesnt work, no one changed anything<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:10:41]&#160; *shrugs*<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:10:51]&#160; have you tried remodelling that device?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:11:04]&#160; yes i did<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:11:13]&#160; k, well reindexing is the only thing left<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:11:29]&#160; but if anyone thinks i'm going to remodel every 24 hours just in case monitoring doesnt work<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:11:32]&#160; they are crazy :)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:11:40]&#160; there has to be a fix for this<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:11:44]&#160; that's not what I was suggesting<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:11:50]&#160; I only remodel by hand personally<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:11:55]&#160; and the process monitoring works just fine<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:12:04]&#160; in a way you are mate, 24 hours ago it was fine<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:12:09]&#160; now its broke with no user intervention<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:12:55]&#160; wow even better<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:12:56]&#160; why do you only remodel by hand?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:13:39]&#160; doesn't the approach you take to operationally/administratively down interface monitoring muck with that? or do you simply remodel when you take an interface down intentionally?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:14:05]&#160; twm1010: because our clients are monitored across tunnels, and some of them have really slow links, I don't want Zenoss remodelling everything at intervals<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:14:38]&#160; and no, we only monitor very specific interfaces, such as switch trunks, router ports, etc...<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:14:49]&#160; and they don't change often<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:15:00]&#160; if they do we get notified by the client of the change<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:15:03]&#160; and remodel the device<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:15:18]&#160; gotcha<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:15:21]&#160; it fits your model then<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:15:26]&#160; we change often<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:15:27]&#160; yeh, it works<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:15:46]&#160; if I were monitoring a LAN or WAN that I had direct access to, then of course I'd do automated modelling<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:16:16]&#160; for one of our clients, some devices take upwards of 30 minutes to remodel<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:16:16]&#160; lol<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:16:17]&#160; lol<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:16:25]&#160; so, this is neat<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:16:32]&#160; after about 5 times of starting and stopping<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:16:33]&#160; when you snmpwalk them you can comfortably read the output line by line<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:16:35]&#160; it shows up as stopped<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:16:45]&#160; however, it didnt show up as stopped until after i started it<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:16:53]&#160; Dieterbe: Yeah, I was hoping to use ssh and somehow compare fstab to what it gets from snmp every so often, something along those lines<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:16:55]&#160; since we're going through a tunnel, bouncing around in the U.S, and then going over to europe across painfully slow links to hit them<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:18:29]&#160; okay so i think my issue is moer the dns service than zenoss<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:18:34]&#160; i had two pids, i killed both<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:18:37]&#160; started the service<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:18:42]&#160; and its still showing up as dead on zenoss<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:18:44]&#160; ashp: i think it's pretty safe to say "what snmp returns me, is what is mounted", so you could simplify your check to "compare fstab to what is mounted"<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:19:05]&#160; Parabola: it's not going to detect that it's back up instantly :P<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:19:11]&#160; Parabola: 5 minute polling cycles<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:19:20]&#160; Dieterbe: Yeah, I've never written any custom zenoss stuff as I only just signed off on purchasing enterprise, but i think i can probably work it out<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:19:22]&#160; wow<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:19:23]&#160; it can't be too hard :)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:19:26]&#160; is there a way to change that?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:19:33]&#160; for certain devices**<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:19:43]&#160; Parabola: it's a global setting per collector<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:19:49]&#160; crap<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:20:03]&#160; if i setup a remote collector later for other offices, would i be able to change the value there?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:20:09]&#160; yes<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:20:18]&#160; alright<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:20:23]&#160; where do i change that value then?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:20:29]&#160; this is all on the same subnet right now anyways<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:20:36]&#160; click collectors<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:20:39]&#160; ashp: are you good at bash scripting? just check if the important filesystems from /etc/fstab are listed in /proc/mounts<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:20:47]&#160; click localhost<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:20:52]&#160; ah gotcha<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:20:57]&#160; i didnt even notice collectors down there :)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:21:05]&#160; Process Cycle Interval (secs)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:21:07]&#160; ashp: you should use a nagios-like script, it's the easiest and works fine. many examples online as well (monitoringexchange.org for instance)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:21:09]&#160; is what you're looking for<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:21:09]&#160; how much bandwidth and CPU load would i expect to get from this if i set to 60 seconds?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:21:22]&#160; you can also change SNMP Performance Cycle Interval (secs)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:21:37]&#160; you could just change the value for process cycle interval globally<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:21:54]&#160; that would monitor all processes at that interval but all other snmp info will be collected at the regular 5 mins<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:22:08]&#160; oh that sounds like a better idea<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:22:14]&#160; is that also under the collector settings?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:22:20]&#160; yeh<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:22:27]&#160; it's the third option down<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:22:30]&#160; yeah i see it :)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:22:32]&#160; awesome<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:22:39]&#160; I'm not sure how that'll affect your graphing of process details<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:22:45]&#160; :-\<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:22:47]&#160; since the graphs are set for 5 mins by default<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:22:53]&#160; my concern here is going to be cpu load from this<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:23:02]&#160; if i change to 30 seconds, or 60 seconds will it blow my shit up?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:23:09]&#160; well, how many processes are we talking here?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:23:13]&#160; 10 maybe<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:23:27]&#160; theres 10 total added, and theres 3 or 4 boxes right now being watched<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:23:29]&#160; 60 seconds won't blow anything up with 10 processes<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:23:36]&#160; alright<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:23:46]&#160; that means it's basically only collecting 40 OIDs per minute<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:23:51]&#160; which is a cakewalk for Zenoss<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:24:04]&#160; what value would i need to start worrying?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:24:25]&#160; lol, maybe like 10 seconds or something<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:24:29]&#160; lol<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:24:32]&#160; depends on a few things<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:24:37]&#160; one second it is then<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:24:38]&#160; I wouldn't set it that low though<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:24:42]&#160; hehe<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:24:57]&#160; 60 seconds is more than enough in my opinion<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:24:58]&#160; after i change that value do i need to restart any services, or should it just work<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:25:02]&#160; 60 seconds is fine yes<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:25:22]&#160; I think it just works, but I've never personally tried<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:25:27]&#160; it may require restarting Zenoss<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:26:16]&#160; the process graphs for cpu, memory, and process count will be affected by the change since the RRD is configured for 5 minute intervals, so they probably won't scale properly...<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:26:26]&#160; I'll check and see what needs to be changed for that<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:26:37]&#160; I know it's something in the template<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:26:58]&#160; i dont mind if the graphs for process are messed up, cpu and mem i do though<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:27:17]&#160; oh if you can find what i need to change to fix it, that would be incredible<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:28:28]&#160; the cpu and memory graphs per process will be messed up, not the ones on the actual perf tab for the device<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:28:51]&#160; oh the perf tab is where i view that data anyway<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:28:55]&#160; so thoes will still be fine?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:29:10]&#160; yup<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:29:25]&#160; the graphs that will be messed up are the ones that you see when you actually click on the process name<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:29:46]&#160; if I can remember how to fix that I'll let you know<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:29:58]&#160; I know RRD options need to be changed<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:31:09]&#160; oh yeh, the default rrd create command... need to override that in the template, I just need to figure out the math to get it down to 60 seconds properly<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:34:03]&#160; how did you become so versed in this product rmatte?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:34:08]&#160; just a long time running? hehe<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:35:05]&#160; Parabola: over a year, yeh<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:35:18]&#160; rmatte, i've been googling and i'm trying to find a way to do remediation<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:35:38]&#160; for linux and windows would be great, but right now linux is really the only place its needed<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:36:04]&#160; i assume since it supports SSH it cant be much of a stretch to do<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:36:39]&#160; oh, well, the only way to do that really is via Event Manager -&gt; Commands<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:36:54]&#160; basically you add a command and setup filters that need to match to kick off the command<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:37:03]&#160; stuff like "if event summary contains whatever"<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:37:18]&#160; event manager, nice , i'll take a look now<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:37:42]&#160; under commands, i assume?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:37:47]&#160; correct<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:38:09]&#160; you could code an expect script to login and restart a process, then set it to kick off on an event down for that process<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:38:30]&#160; you can pass stuff from zenoss to the command such as device name, ip, etc...<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:38:39]&#160; ip is obviously recommended<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:38:43]&#160; yeah<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:39:25]&#160; is there any documentation on this? my reason for asking is i assume i have to have the command, ssh in, accept cert, provide password, then run the actual needed command<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:40:00]&#160; here's an example of a command that we used to run...<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:40:03]&#160; Parabola: have a read up on ssh using keys, vs passwords<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:40:05]&#160; /mspfiles/scripts/create_ticket.pl -autonotify -customer 'nnc-00001' -device '${dev/id}' -deviceIP '${dev/manageIp}' -collector `hostname -f` -first '${evt/firstTime}' -last '${evt/lastTime}' -count '${evt/count}' -summary '${evt/summary}' -noteTitle 'System Monitor Error' -note '${evt/message}' -severity '${evt/severity}' -group '${evt/DeviceGroups}' -impact '${evt/DevicePriority}' -component '${evt/component}' -queue 'Front Line' &gt;&gt;

not at all, no sir<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:41:47]&#160; I see, it's not zenoss specific, it's a unix scripting language<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:41:48]&#160; i'm reading up now<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:41:52]&#160; yeah i see that<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:42:06]&#160; rather than wasting your time, i'll read up on this, if i cant get my script to work, may i ask for assistance?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:42:09]&#160; basically you just want to make a script that triggers ssh, logs in automatically, runs the command to restart the process, then exits<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:42:18]&#160; and you want to be able to pass an IP to the script<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:42:35]&#160; sure, my expect is rusty but I'll do what I can<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:43:21]&#160; there are probably some examples out there that mostly match what you want<br/>[12-Jul-2010 09:44:38]&#160;

I jumped that down to 600 and hit a load of 15 and still no alert<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:41:25]&#160; i wonder how low that needs to be...<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:42:08]&#160; rmatte, can I set my own events to groups?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:42:22]&#160;

rmatte, ok, I checking out the administration guide, and it says I can create "event commands" to be execute it repeatly, I want to create events to check web service content<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:46:50]&#160; did I make myself clear?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:47:56]&#160; it says I can create them using TALES syntax<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:48:46]&#160; do you want to know where is this point in the guide?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:49:06]&#160; well, I understand event commands, but I think you're missing the point of what an event command is<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:49:18]&#160; it's a command that triggers if an alert actually comes in and matches the rules<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:49:32]&#160; unless you're talking about command datasources?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:49:39]&#160; oh, I understand<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:49:42]&#160; what are you exactly trying to check?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:49:46]&#160; give me a scenario<br/><span>[12-Jul-2010 15:51:30]&#160; rmatte, I'm trying to check web service, an example could be that I execute: "php -c </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://foo.bar">http://foo.bar</a><span>", and it returns me something like "1" for "ok" status or "0" for "fail" status</span><br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:52:17]&#160;

rmatte, or isn't needly?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:54:53]&#160; you can create your own event classes and copy the template over then modify it however you like<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:55:57]&#160; rmatte, ok :)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:56:01]&#160; but remember that a device can't be in multiple classes<br/>[12-Jul-2010 15:56:46]&#160; :)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:01:32]&#160; can someone point me in the correct direction for getting disk io graphs for linux hosts?&#160; i can't seem to get this working w/ this latest installation.<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:01:36]&#160; running 2.5.2<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:01:55]&#160; added the ucddisk collector to the linux device class<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:02:03]&#160; nonsenso they are working fine for me in 2.5.2, so it's definitely not Zenoss causing the issue<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:02:14]&#160; I assume you're referring to the IO graph on the perf tab?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:02:38]&#160; yeah, i bet it's something i'm doing wrong (tm)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:02:45]&#160; ucddisk?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:02:58]&#160; no, i'm trying to add disk io graphs in the hw tabs for each disk<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:03:17]&#160; oh, I've never seen that done<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:03:30]&#160; Is there even an OID available via net-snmp to support that?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:03:33]&#160; yeah<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:03:52]&#160; then it shouldn't be rocket science to do<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:04:12]&#160; i know!&#160; hehe.&#160; i've been smacking my head on this one probably for too long.<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:04:37]&#160; What's the OID?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:04:45]&#160; when i model the device i get the error that the OID is bad despite the fact that i can walk it through zenoss and via cli w/o issue<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:05:00]&#160; well, here's the 4 i'm looking at:<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:05:01]&#160; 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.13.15.1.1.3<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:05:04]&#160; 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.13.15.1.1.4<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:05:05]&#160; right, but you have to understand that Zenoss is using a collector plugin to collect that data<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:05:08]&#160; 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.13.15.1.1.5<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:05:10]&#160; 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.13.15.1.1.6<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:05:11]&#160; so it tacks on the disk index automatically<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:05:26]&#160; so when you add the datasource you just want to add it as: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.13.15.1.1<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:05:49]&#160; er, how do i get points on a graph then?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:05:59]&#160; i'm using those OIDs as datasources<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:06:08]&#160; create a datasource with that oid, create a graph, then add the datasource to the graph<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:06:10]&#160; in the graph i setup (that's not wrking)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:06:25]&#160; you can't use those OIDs, you need to shave off the last number<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:06:30]&#160; since Zenoss will add that automatically<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:06:42]&#160; each of those OIDs represents a disk<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:06:42]&#160; aight.&#160; lemme try that.&#160; thx rmatte.&#160; :)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:06:52]&#160; you need to edit the /Server/FileSystem template<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:06:59]&#160; and add a new data source as: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.13.15.1.1<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:07:02]&#160; then add a graph<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:07:06]&#160; and add a datasource to the graph<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:07:08]&#160; and that should do it<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:07:22]&#160; er, no those OIDs represent the written/wrote operations both in accesses and byes.<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:07:46]&#160; so the disk index gets appended to the end of those then?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:07:49]&#160; or what?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:07:52]&#160; if you append an index number to them then you get the disk<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:07:52]&#160; yeah<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:07:57]&#160; I see<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:08:08]&#160; well those should work then, if they're not I have no idea why<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:08:44]&#160; yeah, it's probably something boneheaded or somesuch.<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:08:47]&#160; the only templat they'll work in (if they do work) is the FileSystem template under /Server<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:09:50]&#160; though you'll probably want to make a copy of it in /Server/Linux before editing it<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:10:02]&#160; since those OIDs probably won't apply to other types of snmp enabled servers<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:10:08]&#160; yeah i don't think they do.<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:10:10]&#160; so you don't want to edit it for the whole /Server class<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:10:14]&#160;

(which i need help on that if statement)<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:30:31]&#160; actually its just that, there is no other<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:35:43]&#160; that's easy<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:35:46]&#160; one sec<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:36:00]&#160; here i'll pastebin you the script<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:36:18]&#160; here...<br/><span>[12-Jul-2010 16:36:19]&#160; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://fpaste.org/Tt3g/">http://fpaste.org/Tt3g/</a><br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:36:26]&#160; that accounts for the yes/no<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:36:32]&#160; just add that in to your script<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:37:11]&#160; oh nice<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:37:16]&#160; hmmm, it still has my old password, oh well, it's been changed since lol<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:37:19]&#160; that set ipaddr line, what does that mean<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:37:29]&#160; that's to pass the IP to the script<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:37:41]&#160; so you'd execute the script like /script.xpt 192.168.0.1<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:37:53]&#160; and the script grabs the 192.168.0.1 and sets it to ipaddr<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:38:01]&#160; oo<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:38:01]&#160; which you can then call on in the script with $ipaddr<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:38:19]&#160; which is what you need if you want it to apply to multiple devices<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:38:30]&#160; you'll have to do 1 script per process though<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:40:32]&#160; what does interact do<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:41:35]&#160; that just hands it over to me so that I can type commands<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:41:41]&#160; it's just an auto-login script<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:41:56]&#160; you wouldn't normally use that in an expect script<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:46:37]&#160; damn<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:46:38]&#160; its not working<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:47:10]&#160; so it's not kicking off the script?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:47:13]&#160; no clue<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:47:15]&#160; how would i tell<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:47:29]&#160; you should make a shell script that writes to a file then executes the script<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:47:36]&#160; so that you have some indication whether it ran or not<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:47:51]&#160; and then execute that shell script instead<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:48:18]&#160; then change it to execute the script directly once you have it working<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:48:38]&#160; man is there an easier way<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:48:42]&#160; i cant get ssh on the server right now<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:48:44]&#160; also, be aware that the script will only execute if the event count is 1<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:48:48]&#160; ooo<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:48:51]&#160; so if the event has been racking up event counts, clear it<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:48:58]&#160; then when the new event comes in it'll kick it off<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:49:32]&#160; if i delete the event will that clear it?<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:49:44]&#160; deleting == moving to history<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:49:50]&#160; you never actually delete events, they just get moved<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:49:52]&#160; but yes<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:49:54]&#160; that will do it<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:54:40]&#160; hmm<br/>[12-Jul-2010 16:55:39]&#160;

is there a fix for this?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:39:38]&#160; Parabola: that's an interesting one<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:39:44]&#160; since zenoss keys devices by their IP<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:39:48]&#160; yeah<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:39:53]&#160; yeah, zabbix didnt do this, i'm being told<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:40:04]&#160; and i quote "zabbix didnt do this, it would update the IP"<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:40:23]&#160; so it's just the alerts not clearing that's the issue?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:40:37]&#160; or is it that when the ip changes you lose data because zenoss doesn't pick it up until remodel time?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:41:48]&#160; Parabola: It's always puzzled my why people use dynamic IPs on routers?&#160; Is there some special case scenario at play?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:42:04]&#160; simon<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:42:12]&#160; it just blasts us wtih emails when the IP changes<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:42:19]&#160; and its not puzzling its called money<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:42:23]&#160; this company has 75 stores<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:42:38]&#160; they have regular cable connections at them<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:42:44]&#160; due to cost some of them dont have static<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:43:04]&#160; if i go into the device and clear it out it picks up the new IP<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:43:05]&#160; and all is well<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:43:22]&#160; I see<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:43:39]&#160; You couldn't have configured the sites to connect a tunnel back to the main site regardless of their IP?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:45:18]&#160; honestly we arent going to reconfigure 75 sites just for the sake of monitoring<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:45:26]&#160; theres really no way to do this?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:45:29]&#160; because thats 100% stupid<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:46:28]&#160; well what do you expect?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:46:44]&#160; it to have at least the same functionality as the products its claiming to be better than<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:46:45]&#160; why don't you configure the sites with dyndns?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:47:08]&#160; but even then you'd need some script in Zenoss to change the IP<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:47:39]&#160; it is using dyndns..<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:47:54]&#160; no-ip in particular but yeah, it is<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:48:01]&#160; ok, so your issue is that Zenoss isn't automatically grabbing the new IP?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:48:06]&#160; yup :)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:48:17]&#160; which for some stupid reason changes way more than i would like it too<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:48:19]&#160; like, weekly<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:48:45]&#160; I'm surprised, I had regular residential cable and my IP didn't change for over a year lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:49:38]&#160; well, the way I'd do it in your case is to write a script that constantly checks the hostnames of the devices to see if the IP has changed and updates Zenoss if it does, though it's a pretty hacky way of doing it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:49:54]&#160; there really is no other way at the moment, that would be a good idea for a ZenPack though<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:50:40]&#160; which if i was able to create i would do that for everyone :)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:50:51]&#160; so, back to expect for a script? lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:51:01]&#160; nah, it wouldn't be an expect script<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:51:10]&#160; where else can i put a script?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:51:19]&#160; you mean a shells script and run via cron?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:51:23]&#160; shell script*<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:51:24]&#160; yeh<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:51:45]&#160; I'm checking if there's a better solution<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:52:33]&#160; hmmm, I wish chet was around, he'd probably have a solution for that<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:53:05]&#160; let me test something...<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:54:14]&#160; unhunh, ok... this might be a better solution...<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:54:15]&#160;

rmatte if i make a script that fixes this<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:54:32]&#160; or do I need to remove the old zenpack?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:54:37]&#160; how would i create a zenpack for everyone?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:54:41]&#160; are you able to configure a script on the devices that kicks off when they detect an IP change and update the no-ip entry?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:55:09]&#160; I know that some dyndns clients support that sort of thing, I'm wondering if those devices do or not<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:55:52]&#160; If they do, then there's a really simple solution<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:58:02]&#160; well, it might be complex depending on the degree of scripting that they support (if any)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:58:05]&#160; If I do remove the old HTTPMonitor zenpack, will it delete devices it's bound to if the devices are *not* in the Device Class it creates?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:58:38]&#160; jmp242: no, only if they are in that class<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:59:03]&#160; jmp242: it removes the class it created and all objects under that class, but nothing else<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:59:16]&#160; there should be a warning message that explains that when removing ZenPacks in my opinion<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:59:32]&#160; It sucks when devices just magically dissapear<br/>[13-Jul-2010 08:59:33]&#160; lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:00:35]&#160; man, there needs to be a zProperty that can be set to monitor via the hostname instead of the IP<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:01:10]&#160; There is a warning rmatte<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:01:14]&#160; hence my worry<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:01:29]&#160; but it wasn't specific enough - it said anything provided by it would be deleted<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:01:37]&#160; If that class shows up under the ZenPack's components list then you'll have problems<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:01:38]&#160; so I was wondering if I had to unbind the template everywhere<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:01:51]&#160; no, template bindings have no effect on devices<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:02:00]&#160; it won't delete the devices just because the template is bound to them<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:02:09]&#160; but if they are in the HTTP class that it created, then you'll lose them<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:02:11]&#160; ok, should be fine, I've got no devices in the deviec class it's going to kill<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:02:19]&#160; why are you removing it?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:02:23]&#160; well<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:02:29]&#160; I can't create new data sources<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:02:33]&#160; as HTTPMon type<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:02:39]&#160; it lets me select it in the GUI<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:02:45]&#160; but then creates an SNMP dfata source<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:02:58]&#160; So I was going to upgrade to the .egg<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:03:05]&#160; but I don't know that I can do that in place or not<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:03:07]&#160; you restarted Zenoss after installing the ZenPack I assume?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:03:28]&#160; I installed this zenpack on my Zenoss install back in version 2.0.2 if I recall correctly<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:03:34]&#160; oh<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:03:35]&#160; I've restarted a lot since then<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:03:37]&#160; that's ancient man<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:03:44]&#160; you should always upgrade core packs<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:03:44]&#160; especially to upgrade through 2.5.2 now<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:04:03]&#160; yeh<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:04:15]&#160; So can I just do an upgrade in place with the .egg?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:04:20]&#160; Have you tried just installing the .egg without removing the .zip?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:04:29]&#160; not yet<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:04:34]&#160; I didn't know if it would work<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:04:36]&#160; ZenPacks migrated from .zip to .egg are supposed to automatically handle that<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:04:47]&#160; just try installing the .egg and it should handle it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:04:49]&#160; ok, I'll try just installing the .egg<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:04:53]&#160; cool<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:01]&#160; I usually don't change things until they don't work lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:04]&#160; lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:09]&#160; so I don't upgrade when I should always<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:12]&#160; kind of a bad habbit, but oh well<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:24]&#160; I find with Zenoss it's good to be current, but not too current<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:27]&#160; there's a happy balance<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:28]&#160; lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:29]&#160; Well, it's cyclical when I can work with Zenoss<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:37]&#160; I see<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:39]&#160; sometimes I just can't mess with it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:42]&#160; and need it to be working<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:47]&#160; I work with it all the time, so I take it for granted<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:05:52]&#160; :)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:06:12]&#160; the stability increase from 2.4.5 to 2.5.2 was excellent<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:06:35]&#160; I can actually leave my Zenoss servers running for over 2 months without worrying about them leaking memory all over the place<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:06:37]&#160; it's lovely<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:06:50]&#160; looks like it works<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:06:55]&#160; good stuff<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:06:57]&#160; the .zip is gone and the .egg is there<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:07:12]&#160; now to see if I can see inside the data source without a traceback lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:07:16]&#160; yeh, there's a special file in the .eggs of zenpacks that were migrated from .zips that tells them how to handle the upgrade<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:07:25]&#160; restart Zenoss before you try<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:09:16]&#160; Man, my new Zenoss server is a dream - much faster than the old one lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:09:37]&#160; restart done in 10 seconds instead of 5 mintues<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:15:53]&#160; nice<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:16:00]&#160; yeh, that is an improvement<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:16:23]&#160; I love having vms for my zenoss servers, can always go in and increase resources when needed<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:16:59]&#160; So in 2.5.2, why would it not let me add an IP Service on a device?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:17:08]&#160; It just greys out the ok button<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:17:41]&#160; I assume it has something to do with that I can't do SNMP, but I should be able to see if port 80 is responding I would think...<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:17:42]&#160; you need to type the ip service in and wait for a dropdown, then select it from there<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:17:53]&#160; and then you'll see it in square brackets and you'll be able to click ok<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:18:01]&#160; sometimes it won't give you the dropdown, takes a few tries<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:18:07]&#160; so cancel out and open it again until it does<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:18:10]&#160; (it's buggy)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:18:21]&#160; should be resolved in the new interface<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:18:51]&#160; I see<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:18:53]&#160; worked this time<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:18:58]&#160; it was a bit non-obvious<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:18:59]&#160; thanks<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:19:17]&#160; no problem, and yeh, it is unobvious<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:19:24]&#160; I just know from experience<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:19:25]&#160; lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:30:41] mrayzenoss is now known as mray<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:30:54]&#160; mray: good morning<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:31:53]&#160; rmatte: mornign<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:32:00]&#160; s/mornign/morning/<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:32:04]&#160; hehe<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:32:12]&#160; that actually works with Skype<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:32:26]&#160; seriously?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:32:28]&#160; that's awesome<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:32:32]&#160; yup<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:35:42]&#160; son of a ...<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:35:52]&#160; another failed Time Machine recovery with OSX<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:36:02]&#160; that sucks<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:36:17]&#160; I thought time machine was supposed to be pretty foolproof lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:36:26]&#160; I'm a higher-grade of fool<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:38:38]&#160; so now I have to do a direct disk to disk copy, which means I have to be away from my computer for several hours&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;<br/>[13-Jul-2010 09:56:17]&#160; bigegor: checked in the ZenPacks.community.SQLDatasource and ZenPacks.community.ZenODBC update last night<br/><span>[13-Jul-2010 09:58:55]&#160;

st3v3o: yeah, soon<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:04:53]&#160; just need documentation :)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:06:11]&#160; cool&#226;&#8364;&brvbar;.SQLDataSource sounds promising<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:06:12]&#160; mray: i will do it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:09:47]&#160; st3v3o: with SQLDataSource you can use any Pythons DB-API compatible modules to access database. And it has some additional features ported from WMIDataSource.<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:10:04]&#160; sweet<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:10:34]&#160; I really like the WMIDataSource...<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:10:53]&#160; :)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:11:40] * rmatte wants to strangle whoever is in charge of decision concerning snmp at vmware<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:12:14]&#160; you can either collect vm info, or you can collector system info, but you can't collect both anymore<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:12:21]&#160; collect*<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:13:35] &lt;|rt|&gt; If I login as admin the google map shows all 3 locations but if I log in as my user I only see our main office on the map....I'm assuming it's a permission issue but have no idea where to look to correct it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:14:56]&#160; |rt|: enterprise or core?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:15:01] &lt;|rt|&gt; core<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:15:05]&#160; hmmm, that's odd then<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:15:26]&#160; are all of the locations at the same level on the map?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:15:31]&#160; or do you have to drill down to some?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:15:46] &lt;|rt|&gt; they are all at the same level<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:15:53] &lt;|rt|&gt; atleast as admin they are<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:16:05]&#160; have you tried clearing the geocache on your user?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:16:35]&#160; Locations -&gt; Dropdown Menu -&gt; Clear Geocache Code<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:16:37] &lt;|rt|&gt; yeah....but do I need to go to each location to clear that or is that a global cache for all locations that are cleared<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:16:39]&#160; then view the map again<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:16:43]&#160; global<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:16:51] &lt;|rt|&gt; I've already tried that multiple times<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:17:01]&#160; have you tried modified the location addresses a bit?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:17:05]&#160; to simplify them?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:17:10]&#160; modifying*<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:17:20] &lt;|rt|&gt; and I can tell that it has indeed been cleared b/c you can see it reaquire the addresses<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:17:37]&#160; right, but after it re-acquires them, can you see those locations?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:17:47] &lt;|rt|&gt; tried modifying it as well....the 2 addresses that don't show up in my user account are just city and state<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:17:55]&#160; I see<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:17:58] &lt;|rt|&gt; nope it's still just the one<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:18:19] &lt;|rt|&gt; I've tried putting actual street addresses for the other 2 locations to see if that would help as well to no avail<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:18:35]&#160; no idea then, I *highly* doubt it's a permissions issue since there aren't really any permissions in core which dictates who can or can't see specific locations<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:19:03]&#160; ACLs like that are only implemented in enterprise<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:19:29] &lt;|rt|&gt; hmm...let me try to create a new user and see what happens with it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:19:36]&#160; I'm sure you could get at permissions like that via the zope management interface, but I doubt you've even been in there?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:19:41]&#160; k<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:20:03]&#160; by the way, are there devices assigned to those locations right now?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:20:10]&#160; or do they have 0 devices in them?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:22:03] &lt;|rt|&gt; hmm new user can see all 3 locations<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:22:07] &lt;|rt|&gt; there are devices in each location<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:22:29] &lt;|rt|&gt; nope I haven't been into zope at all<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:22:58] &lt;|rt|&gt; let me see what happens if I change this new user to a ZenManager and then add them to the group my other user is in<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:23:08] &lt;|rt|&gt; to see if either of those changes replicate the issue<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:23:30]&#160; k<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:23:50]&#160; by the way, don't use ZenManager if you're trying to assign admin permissions<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:23:54]&#160; use Manager<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:24:52]&#160; grrr... i'm getting zenperfsnmp timeouts on devices, which is then causing zenpersnmp to issue a heartbeat failure event (just started last night)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:24:58] &lt;|rt|&gt; yeah my main user has both zenmanager and manager permissions<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:25:09]&#160; just give Manager, it's redundant<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:25:16]&#160; I've set the zproperties to only try once, with a 1s timeout, but zenperfsnmp still waits 300s ?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:25:25] &lt;|rt|&gt; k<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:25:40] &lt;|rt|&gt; I haven't gotten to read up on the roles yet<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:26:15]&#160; gwb2352: what zProperties value did you set exactly?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:26:46]&#160; zSnmpTries, zSnmpTimeout<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:26:57] &lt;|rt|&gt; looks like it's just an issue with that account for some reason<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:27:01]&#160; gwb2352: the amount of time it waits is dependant on zCollectorClientTimeout I believe<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:27:13] &lt;|rt|&gt; I'll delete my original account and recreate it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:27:14]&#160; gwb2352: the problem is, if you decrease that to 1 second, good luck modelling anything<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:27:19]&#160; it's something along the lines of "I want to figure this out, but don't want to get zenperfsnmp errors in the meantime"<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:27:37]&#160; gwb2352: what exactly are you trying to accomplish?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:27:56]&#160; it's all local LAN, 5 of the 7 devices are still working, just 2 stopped magically last night<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:28:06]&#160; oh, you're getting timeouts<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:28:11]&#160; so I have 7 identical devices<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:28:14]&#160; 5 are still working<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:28:16]&#160; why would you DECREASE values if you're getting timeouts?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:28:34]&#160; the timeout is because the snmp query never returns<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:28:58]&#160; which (my thinking) was causing the zenperfsnmp daemon to not complete in its cycle time, which (my thinking) would then cause the heartbeat email<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:29:01]&#160; then just toggle zSnmpMonitorIgnore to true for those devices until you fix SNMP on them<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:29:06]&#160; :)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:29:06]&#160; don't mess around with timeout settings<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:29:17]&#160; i like that<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:29:31] &lt;|rt|&gt; rmatte: deleting and recreating the account worked....just in case anyone else runs across that issue<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:29:46]&#160; |rt|: cool, but bizarre lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:30:18]&#160; gwb2352: by the way, that won't help with the heartbeats<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:30:31]&#160; gwb2352: heartbeats are way too sensitive in 2.5.2, they fire off all the time<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:30:36]&#160; gwb2352: I just completely ignore them<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:30:47]&#160; gwb2352: as long as the Zenoss processes are all running you're good<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:31:29]&#160; add something to your alerting rule to filter them out<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:31:40]&#160; well, they did alert me to the fact that snmp stopped working randomly last night...<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:31:57]&#160; you sure it actually stopped working?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:32:16]&#160; yeah - commandline zenperfsnmp -v 10 -d XXXXX no love either<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:32:27]&#160; did it error out, or what?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:32:42] &lt;|rt|&gt; rmatte: it could have been the base location setting in that portlet<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:33:05]&#160; |rt|: that's exactly what I was thinking, which is why I asked you if the locations were multilevel<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:33:15] &lt;|rt|&gt; If I set that to one of the locations the others go away even if I zoom out for some reason<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:33:18]&#160; I end up with a "2010-07-13 10:32:54,549 DEBUG zen.zenperfsnmp: Total of 1 queued events"<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:33:22]&#160; and then an eventual timeout<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:33:30]&#160; |rt|: ah, I didn't know it would work even if it wasn't multilevel<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:33:34] &lt;|rt|&gt; I would have thought that setting would have just centered a location<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:33:51]&#160; |rt|: no, doesn't work that way<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:34:05] &lt;|rt|&gt; oh i see what you're saying so you'll see all the locations in that hierarchy<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:34:18]&#160; gwb2352: odd, well, disable snmp monitoring for those devices as I stated and then it should be fine<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:34:35] &lt;|rt|&gt; so if I set the base locations to just /Locations I see all the offices<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:34:56]&#160; ...and hopefully I get the time to figure out why it stopped working last night.&#160; 3AM is an odd time which makes me believe the device admin wasn't mucking with things.<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:35:02]&#160; gwb2352: when you're ready to switch them back scroll down to the bottom of zProperties and delete the local property so that they inherit settings from higher up<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:35:11] &lt;|rt|&gt; well I thought I tried changing that in my old account but since I've deleted and recreated it I can't go back to check to see if that was the problem or not<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:35:44]&#160; |rt|: that probably was it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:37:30] &lt;|rt|&gt; yeah seem pretty likely<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:41:53]&#160; anybody else notice in 2.5.2 (if using LDAP authentication) you can't change /ZenUsers/uid information?&#160; (the "Enter your password to confirm changes" seems to require uid password, not Manager password)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:41:58]&#160; hey guys<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:42:13]&#160; Parabola: fwiw, running your monitoring deployment over tunnels if the remote endpoints are a surefire way to lessen alerts and probably well worth doing<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:42:33]&#160; hey frozty<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:42:52]&#160; rmatte: the details around how a client IP address changes are left up to the ISP<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:43:04]&#160; (re your remark of an IP not changing in over a year)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:43:32]&#160; frozty_sa:&#160; the ip changes so much<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:43:41]&#160; i have no clue why<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:43:46]&#160; Parabola: also, you gain the upside of being to monitor the point-to-point tunnel IP<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:43:58]&#160; we cannot create a tunnel from every single one of these sites<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:00]&#160; its not happening<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:07]&#160; its odd that zabbix does this just fine<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:07]&#160; and<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:10]&#160; yes you can, it's 3 hours worth of effort at most :P<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:12]&#160; zenoss wont<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:17]&#160; zabbix indexes hosts on hostnames<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:22]&#160; zenoss classifies them on IP<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:31]&#160; I've got extensive experience on both<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:46]&#160; while i understand what you're saying<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:47]&#160;&#160; <br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:52]&#160; i'm kind of stuck finding a fix for this<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:44:56]&#160; and the tunnel isnt an option<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:45:07]&#160; i'm&#160; just the engine here, i'm not the guy pushing the pedal<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:45:08]&#160; I know about 35% of the zabbix codebase as well, and I can tell you that for anything even remotely complex, I'd never want to ever touch zabbix again<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:45:11]&#160; Parabola: okay well<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:45:20]&#160; yeah i like zenoss better myself<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:45:28]&#160; but these routers support no-ip out of the box<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:45:33]&#160; what you could do is have zenoss monitor a collection of private IPs<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:45:35]&#160; and thats what they're using and i cant change this setup<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:45:58]&#160; and then on the zenoss host itself have iptables DNAT rules that are dynamically updated with the endpoint IP addresses<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:46:15]&#160; write a small script to update the DNAT table every so often as the dyn IPs change<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:46:30]&#160; cunning :)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:46:37]&#160; and then run it every however-long it's required to run<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:46:54]&#160; hmm<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:47:02]&#160; Simon4: I often joke to people that my job is to be a glue specialist ;)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:47:16]&#160; :)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:47:35] * Simon4 just works on the fact that he's generally one google search ahead of the customer<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:47:56]&#160; Parabola: how is the no-ip info being updated?&#160; directly from the routers?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:48:08]&#160; Parabola: best of both worlds for you, in that you never have to hack zenoss and maintain any updates, and you gain everything that zenoss has while also not needing to plonk stuff down behind the customer CPEs<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:48:26]&#160; :)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:48:30]&#160; rmatte:&#160; yup<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:49:27]&#160; Parabola: so no way to execute some sort of script when they do it?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:49:43] * frozty_sa bets it's a dumb cheap&amp;nasty consumer DSL router<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:49:51]&#160; probably<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:50:03]&#160; and my next bet will be that there's a mailserver in the head office as well ;)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:50:34]&#160; I was going to suggest having the router call on Zenoss and update the IP when it updates the no-ip<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:50:42]&#160; but that's probably not possible with fisher price routers<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:50:50]&#160; Hmm<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:51:01]&#160; well, it could be if they run something like Tomato firmware<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:51:08]&#160; yeh<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:51:13]&#160; rmatte: some of them allow you to set a specific service where to update the IP<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:51:13]&#160; or even OpenWRT<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:51:43]&#160; I &lt;3 Tomato firmware<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:51:47]&#160; since the DynDNS "protocol" is technically just either an HTTP POST or ordered GET<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:52:00]&#160; but not all give you that option<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:52:09]&#160; sooo much better than the linksys default - no more random lockups requiring a reboot of the router<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:52:34]&#160; back<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:52:36]&#160; they are sonic walls<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:52:48]&#160; OTOH, if it's an office, they ought to look into something like Vyatta or m00nwall or such at least<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:53:03]&#160; but theres a bunch of clients<br/><span>[13-Jul-2010 10:53:07]&#160; frozty_sa: right, I'm aware, but I'm saying that it would need to trigger a script which determines what the new IP is, then access a URL such as </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://whatever:8080/zport/dmd/Devices/Workstation/yourhostname/setManageIp?ip=192.168.0.1">http://whatever:8080/zport/dmd/Devices/Workstation/yourhostname/setManageIp?ip=192.168.0.1</a><br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:53:10]&#160; so we have a million and 5 different devices out there<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:53:22]&#160; jmp242: pfffft. you overestimate the amount of bad management and practice out there :P<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:53:25]&#160; frozty_sa: and sets the new IP in Zenoss automatically<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:53:28]&#160; err, underestimate<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:53:29]&#160; that would eliminate the issue<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:53:35]&#160; rmatte: no sure, I know what you're saying<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:53:43]&#160; the downside is just that they're all shit :D<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:53:49]&#160; yeh<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:53:50]&#160; so i assume snmp cannot account for this?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:54:06]&#160; Parabola: well, if you could send a trap to the zenoss server from the device, maybe<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:54:12]&#160; Parabola: not unless you can get the device to trap the new IP back to zenoss<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:54:24]&#160; Parabola: then have a transform that sets the new IP and moves the trap to history<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:54:25]&#160; ifOperStatus trap<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:54:32]&#160; and then what rmatte said<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:55:15]&#160; frozty_sa: not sure if ifOperStatus would do the trick though, and IP address can be re-assigned without the interface actually going down<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:55:16] * Simon4 wonders how you work out which device that trap came from<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:55:23]&#160; i guess the problem is there sint one fix for this<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:55:23]&#160; s/and/an<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:55:27]&#160; we have over 200 clients<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:55:28]&#160; since it's coming from a "new" ip..<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:55:33]&#160; some we put equpiment in , some they put it in<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:55:37]&#160; and what Simon4 said<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:56:12]&#160; Simon4: zenoss keeps those alerts<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:56:18]&#160; this isnt by any chance a feature in 3.0 is it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:56:20]&#160; the only fix is to somehow have the sites themselves deliver the new IP to Zenoss and have it updated<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:56:23]&#160; to monitor host by dns isntead of ip<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:56:35]&#160; frozty_sa: sure, but what tags those alerts back to the original device, unless you can encode the hostname in the trap<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:56:36]&#160; Parabola: nope, not that I've seen<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:56:46]&#160; Parabola: 3.0 is 2.5.2 with a new UI skin basically<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:56:49]&#160; Simon4: orite, yeah<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:56:59]&#160; Parabola: nothing has really changed on the back end between the versions<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:57:13]&#160; Simon4: some of what we've got on our DSL infrastructure would help Parabola, but we're probably in a different country entirely :p<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:57:15]&#160; other than new zope and new python<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:57:26]&#160; heheh<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:57:32]&#160; yeah these are ATT DSL lines<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:57:36]&#160; leases dont last more than 48 hours<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:57:42]&#160; that's so lame<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:57:50]&#160; Umm, doesn't business connections come with static IP/<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:57:52]&#160; ?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:57:57]&#160; did i say business?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:02]&#160; he's probably working off residential<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:02]&#160; they are residental dsl lines<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:06]&#160; jmp242: not if management decides to go cheap on it ;)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:17]&#160; you guys act like i sat down with a sheet of paper and planned all this shit<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:17]&#160; I had ATT residential DSL for years, static IP was free<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:17]&#160; we dynamically autobind people's username in a specific fashion to a DNS record, so people can check up their own IPs without any special stuff<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:19]&#160; You want to monitor remote residential DSL equipment?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:20]&#160; I used to work for them too<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:20]&#160; Simon4: ^<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:24]&#160; its consulting, you dont always have a choice<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:29]&#160; I had business internet in my apartment for $90/month, are you guys really so cheap as to not be able to afford that sort of thing?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:39]&#160; jmp242:&#160; jesus chrsit read up<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:49]&#160; rmatte:&#160; you arent fucking listening<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:53]&#160; i do not work for this company<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:58:56]&#160; they refuse to change it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:01]&#160; I see<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:03]&#160; i'm a god damn consultant<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:05]&#160; I missed that part<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:06]&#160; yeah<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:11]&#160; we service about 200 clients<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:15]&#160; some we put service in for<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:17]&#160; others already had it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:25]&#160; theres not much i can do in this case man<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:25]&#160; mmm, I have some doubts that Zenoss was really designed for this sort of network layout<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:38]&#160; yeah i'm getting yelled at because i picked zenoss<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:38]&#160; I've always had the feeling (with Core anyway)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:44]&#160; yeh, I misunderstood, I thought these were 200 sites belonging to the same organization<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:45]&#160; my bad<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:49]&#160; its okay :)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 10:59:54]&#160; sorry im just frustrated<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:00:02]&#160; i picked zenoss to move to from zabbix due to the agent bullshit<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:00:04]&#160; understandable<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:00:07]&#160; then he drops this in my lap<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:00:09]&#160; jmp242: for instance here in SA, you basically down a VPN-dialing router if you want a static IP. and then the provider who supplies the IP rips you about &gt;=10x times the cost of other services, for a more contended service<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:00:11]&#160; that the idea was there was one internal network and you could talk to the devices directly<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:00:16]&#160; "oh yea monitor these DSL lines too"<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:00:25]&#160; Parabola: I think going with that script option is probably your best bet<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:00:32]&#160; and it'll stay stable as well<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:00:39]&#160; it's not like cron will go and fuck out any time soon<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:00:45]&#160; yeah<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:00:58]&#160; script writes out a ferm config file, ferm reloads it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:01:07]&#160; frozty_sa: if you use a VPN dialing router<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:01:10]&#160; sounds above my head on a product i know little about<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:01:10]&#160; I wouldn't alert on ping events until the event count hits 3 though, that way you avoid false positives<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:01:18]&#160; since cron can only run once per minute<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:01:21]&#160; can't you use servers / endpoints in another country to save money?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:01:22]&#160; drop monit in for good measure to make sure thing stay up<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:01:30]&#160; I'm thinking stuff like SwissVPN...<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:01:35]&#160; rmatte:&#160; doesnt matter, the shit changes every 2 days at least<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:01:40]&#160; jmp242: no, you essentially get a blackbox from them<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:01:42]&#160; at 2am i get woken up by shit loads of emails<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:01:48]&#160; Zenoss didn't care for our DMVPN approach at first, i had to keep deleting the networks and let the remodeling rebuild them<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:02:18]&#160; what would it take for me to get this feature added<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:02:22]&#160; Parabola: right, I'm suggesting a script that constantly resolves and watches the hostnames every minute and automatically updates the IP in Zenoss if it changes<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:02:23]&#160; Money<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:02:27]&#160; how mcuh<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:02:35]&#160; jmp242: in terms of numbers, DSL here is around $10 per 15GB or whatever. if you want that same package on a static IP, you're likely to pay $150<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:02:45]&#160; but Zenoss pings every minute, so to avoid false positives you'd only want to alert after 3 minutes of missed pings<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:02:47]&#160; rmatte:&#160; which sounds great, however i dont have the skillset to write such a script<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:02:49]&#160; that's really the best option<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:02:58]&#160; Parabola: It would take you buying the paid version I'm sure<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:02:58]&#160; Parabola: let me throw something together<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:13]&#160; theacolyte:&#160; the paid version DOES support devices by DNS not just ip?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:22]&#160; I missed the whole thing<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:29]&#160; Parabola: nah it doesn't<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:29]&#160; Parabola: Are you asking if you can add a device by FQDN?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:38]&#160; theacolyte: he wants to monitor by host<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:39]&#160; no, he wants to monitor it by FQDN<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:43]&#160; not add it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:44]&#160; theacolyte: not have hardcoded IPs<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:54]&#160; theacolyte: nutshell: monitor by host, ATT home DSL lines in businesses, leases evey 48 hours<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:55]&#160; Because i add all my devices by their name and not by IP<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:56]&#160; theacolyte: since his sites have dynamically assigned IPs that change every 48 hours<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:03:59]&#160; jmp242: and it literally becomes a case of you can't even easily jump providers without plugging out the DSL link itself from the blackbox router they give you, and putting it into another one<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:04:00]&#160; ahhhhhhhhh<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:04:13]&#160; theacolyte:&#160; but after that 2 days i have to login to zenoss, clear out the IP and let it resolve it again<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:04:13]&#160; twm1010 already said dmvpn :(<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:04:19]&#160; theres 75 stores for this company<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:04:23]&#160; and its alot of work to do..<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:04:38]&#160; dmvpn did work, but during rollout it threw a big fit on us<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:05:07]&#160; and you've have to assume you've got similar or same equipment at each site<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:06:12]&#160; Do you have tunnels to the sites? or no?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:06:44]&#160; You need something agent based that can phone home and update it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:06:49]&#160; Zenoss may not be your product honestly<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:07:43]&#160; yeah so im finding out<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:07:46]&#160; kinda dissapointing, i like it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:07:54]&#160; i've spent alot of time figuring stuff out with it and bothering you guys<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:10]&#160; That's why it's always a good idea to set requirements before you start evaluating<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:19]&#160; (That doesn't help you now obviously)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:19]&#160; Well, its a model problem right, its meant to do something a certain way, ver yhard to make a product fit every mold<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:19]&#160; hehe<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:29]&#160; i agree<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:37]&#160; honestly i had no idea i was going to be asked to monitor this<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:42]&#160; But now you know!<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:42]&#160; it was for linux/windows servers<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:46]&#160; well... does it all have to be one system?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:51]&#160; monitor the boxes, drive space, and ospreocess / servers<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:56]&#160; services*<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:08:58]&#160; what do you mean<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:09:04]&#160; i'm not running zabbix and this thats retarded<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:09:29]&#160; I use Zenoss for most of my monitoring and alerting, I use our leftover SolarWinds license for explicit monitoring of interfaces, since it has variable polling and a nice reporting engine<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:10:07]&#160; I use a combination of HP SIM and Zenoss<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:10:13]&#160; until Zenoss breaks from RRD to a database option, I won't get that nice variable polling without using multiple collectors, and even then, it's still per device<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:10:18]&#160; There's a fair amount of duplication there, but I'm fine with that<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:10:54]&#160; rmatte: are you around?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:11:04]&#160; I've yet to use SIM, still meaning to attack the ILO2 and Insight agents configs for best practice for Zenoss<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:11:12]&#160; do you have anything to that effect already ?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:11:33]&#160; You mean integrating the HP agents into Zenoss with zenpacks?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:11:36]&#160; nah<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:11:54]&#160; the whole shbang really<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:12:05]&#160; Yeah, I haven't<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:12:14]&#160; trap forwarding from ILO to zenoss, etc, what is the way to do it right?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:12:28]&#160; Ah, no idea, that's why I run SIM<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:12:33]&#160; when in rome...<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:12:51]&#160; kill romans<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:12:55]&#160; yeah, we're starting to go back to HP, but I've got Dell, IBM, HP, Mac, etc.<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:13:12]&#160; Scary enough, we even have some Compaq servers still running<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:13:29]&#160; so what product should i be using<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:13:37]&#160; does solar winds ip monitor support what i need?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:13:42]&#160; That's a really bad thing to do<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:13:43]&#160; i've used it before but its been a couple years<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:13:44]&#160; Do your own research<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:13:48]&#160; None of us will know your requirements<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:13:59]&#160; Sit down, write out everything you have learned through the process and create a list of what you need<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:14:01]&#160; my requirements are aparently zenoss mixed with some zabbix<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:14:02]&#160; Then shop it around<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:14:06]&#160; That doesn't work<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:14:08]&#160; lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:14:10]&#160; shhh<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:14:10]&#160; Don't be lazy with it -<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:14:12]&#160; hehe<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:14:37]&#160; be thankful that you didn't waste anything but time/money and didn't buy a product that doesnt' do what you need it to do<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:01]&#160; Parabola: I don't think SW is the one for you either<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:18]&#160; alot of time<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:19]&#160; was just making the point that you may need more than one product to get done what you're after<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:19]&#160; If you do engage solarwinds, for the love of god don't give them your phone number<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:23]&#160; but i am billing for it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:26]&#160; lol good to know<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:28]&#160; they like to call?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:32]&#160; You can... say that<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:40]&#160; I wouldn't recommend SW<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:48]&#160; It's pretty hackish<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:52]&#160; it's very pretty but the backend and management interface blow chunks<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:15:55]&#160; Their network monitoring is really good<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:16:01]&#160; wtf else is there<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:16:04]&#160; But the application side, not so much<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:16:10]&#160; It depeneds on your #*()@*#)* requirements<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:16:23]&#160; I could just start spouting bullshit for you, but I don't think it would help you<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:16:34]&#160; yeh, if you can lay out a point form of everything you need it to be able to do<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:00]&#160; im about to stab you all<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:03]&#160; :P<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:16] * rmatte sighs<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:19]&#160; lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:20]&#160; The best we can do is let you know what's out there<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:22]&#160; adn there is a lot<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:27]&#160; i understand<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:31]&#160; i'm sticking with zenoss if i can<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:35]&#160; the other monitoring is quite nice<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:43]&#160; well, try the script then that rmatte suggested<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:56]&#160; well, I'm throwing something together right now for him...<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:17:58]&#160; he was nice enough to whip a quick one up for me he said<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:08]&#160; rmatte is too nice<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:10]&#160; I'm actually kinda surprised Zenoss can't monitor by hostname<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:11]&#160; I'm not done whipping yet lol<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:12]&#160; he knows this<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:18]&#160; this is a badass product<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:19]&#160; twm1010: so am I<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:21]&#160; i want to keep it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:29]&#160; I guess I never noticed that behavior before<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:30]&#160; twm1010: there are quite a few small and stupid shortcomings still present<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:31]&#160; wonder if i paid the devs, if they would add it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:36]&#160; I add by domain name, but it uses the IP anyway?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:43]&#160; When you hit the Reset IP context drop down, there is text there that says you can put in a hostname<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:49]&#160; Parabola: they do do PS work for core, so you could ask<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:53]&#160; Parabola: I believe professional services tasks are available<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:54]&#160; Parabola: it would be expensive though<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:18:55]&#160; heh, snap<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:01]&#160; whats expensive?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:09]&#160; more than a couple grand?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:15]&#160; They charge like over $100/hour I believe<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:18]&#160; to be honest if i can get my employer to pay for this<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:26]&#160; would you guys like to have that feature?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:31]&#160; contact them and get a quote<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:34]&#160; I wouldn't need it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:34]&#160; i'd pay to get it added to Core<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:39]&#160; stfu theacolyte&#160; yes you do<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:42]&#160; Parabola: absolutely<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:46]&#160; "Are you sure you would like to reset the IP?&#160; Leave blank to use DNS."&#160; does that just lookup the IP via DNS and then store it?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:55]&#160; i mean assuming they let me release it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:55]&#160; I don't monitor... dynamic stuff<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:19:57]&#160; I wouldn't need it now, but it would most likely come in handy eventually<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:20:02]&#160; or they include the stuff i bought IN the next update to core<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:20:04]&#160; i would pay for it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:20:09]&#160; if they say only i can have it, i wouldnt buy it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:20:14]&#160; I remember some forum thread about this at one point?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:20:32]&#160; I wonder if you could do this in a round-about sort of way through a performance template bound to a host<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:20:40]&#160; Parabola: nah, it's your decision if you want it rolled in or not as far as I understand.<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:20:41]&#160; using dynamic DNS<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:20:56]&#160; rmatte:&#160; then im going to contact them<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:21:11]&#160; since i cant help out with questions in here very often, the least i can do is put my wallet in there and help<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:21:19]&#160; im sure alot of people would like that feature<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:21:36]&#160; it would be handy indeed<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:22:13]&#160; So if I get this right, you're going to monitor devices on the other side of a router with a dynamic address?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:22:31]&#160; he's monitoring sites by their internet address<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:22:34]&#160; no tunnels or anything<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:22:42]&#160; just a whole bunch of dsl sites<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:22:51]&#160; well, if those sites answer on port 80<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:22:51]&#160; with dynamic hosts configured for them<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:22:58]&#160; No<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:23:00]&#160; Not good enough!<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:23:01]&#160; yeh, he could use the httpmon zenpack<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:23:10]&#160; but that wouldn't give him full monitoring<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:23:21]&#160; true<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:23:25]&#160; Parabola: are you just monitoring for ping status?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:23:32]&#160; Parabola: or are you doing full snmp at the sites?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:23:43]&#160; if he wants more, he needs a VPN tunnel most likely<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:23:54]&#160; yeh, but vpn tunnels are out of the question apparently<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:24:01]&#160; just ping is what i "need"<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:24:07]&#160; right now its snmp<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:24:12]&#160; the one im testing with is a sonicwall<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:24:13]&#160; Parabola: do those routers respond on port 80 at each site?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:24:18]&#160; some do, why<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:24:24]&#160; not the routers<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:24:27]&#160; but webservers behind them<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:24:36]&#160; because you could use the httpmonitor zenpack, which is capable of monitoring websites by just their hostnames<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:24:58]&#160; what you wouldnt' have is CPU/Memory/Disk, etc.<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:25:01] &lt;|rt|&gt; some opensource projects that allow for paid features charge a lower rate if the changes can be released to the community<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:25:03]&#160; yeh<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:25:08] &lt;|rt|&gt; I know that pfsense does that<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:25:27]&#160; |rt|: I don't think Zenoss does that, they have a fixed rate as far as I'm aware<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:25:36]&#160; but wouldn't hurt to ask<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:26:04] &lt;|rt|&gt; a bummer....i think it's a good incentive for companies to help give back<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:26:14]&#160; agreed<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:27:32]&#160; rmatte: OTRS has 1600 sysconfig options (my brain hurts)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:27:49]&#160; twm1010: haha, did you just start using it?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:27:50]&#160; but not a difficult install, seems ridiculously flexible<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:27:58]&#160; it's very very flexible<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:28:01]&#160; that's why we use it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:28:07]&#160; though we obviously have custom coding done for it<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:28:37]&#160; Yeah, I like it personally, but I think our managers will want something more polished and pretty (they never seem to care about whether its functional)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:28:45]&#160; Installing additional modules can be done right from the UI too, it's a piece of cake<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:28:50]&#160; look in to the ITSM modules<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:28:53]&#160; you'll love them<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:29:07]&#160; otrs 3.0 will have a completely new interface<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:29:10]&#160; yeah I installed damn near everything to play around with it, it's really slick, some of it not intuitive<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:29:11]&#160; much more polished and such<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:29:45]&#160; (not sure what it is about the 3.0 version number coinciding with interface redesign)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:29:47]&#160; :)<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:30:11]&#160; alright im back<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:30:17]&#160; i emailed sales for a quote on the feature<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:30:25]&#160; twm1010: have you looked at any others yet?<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:30:28]&#160; not really<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:30:29]&#160; told them in the email i wanted the feature included in the CORE release<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:30:51]&#160; Parabola: cool, it'll be interesting to see if they'll agree or not<br/>[13-Jul-2010 11:31:00]&#160;

hello<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:06:41]&#160; zenoss uses rrd files to record statistics like the cpu usage<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:06:54]&#160; however, does it prune the rrd files at some point by default?<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:07:06]&#160; or does it record everything until disk space runs out?<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:07:43]&#160; I actually want the latter, since I want to test a distributed system<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:08:09]&#160; and the cpu/io/ram usage/etc. measurements of each device are necessary to draw some conclusions<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:09:00]&#160; this implies that (a) zenoss must not throw away any portion of the rrd data&#160; (b) I somehow need to make a copy of the rrd files so that I can give said copy to other people who will draw conclusions from it<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:09:26]&#160; rrd files are self pruning by design<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:09:32]&#160; also, it would be useful to extract the event console history in some way<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:09:43]&#160; have a read about rrdtool<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:10:06]&#160;

that would be enough<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:11:25]&#160; can this be done via the zenoss web frontend?<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:11:39]&#160; yup, under collectors-&gt;localhost<br/>[14-Jul-2010 08:12:03]&#160;

say you wanted to exit with a code AND provide a datasource<br/>[14-Jul-2010 15:40:07]&#160; right<br/>[14-Jul-2010 15:40:28]&#160; you would have the script exit with error code 1, which is a system thing, there's no actual output to stdout...<br/>[14-Jul-2010 15:40:57]&#160; you would also have it output like: THIS IS MY ERROR MESSAGE|myDataPoint=1<br/>[14-Jul-2010 15:41:15]&#160; the message displayed in the alert generated in Zenoss would be "THIS IS MY ERROR MESSAGE"<br/>[14-Jul-2010 15:41:21]&#160; and the datapoint value would still be collected<br/>[14-Jul-2010 15:41:50]&#160; a datapoint needs to be added with the exact same name (case sensitive) as what you're using in the script (in this case, myDataPoint) under the datasource for it to work<br/>[14-Jul-2010 15:42:04]&#160;

and the script should always exit with error code 1, correct?<br/>[14-Jul-2010 15:44:11]&#160; pretty sure the severity is based on the exit code too<br/>[14-Jul-2010 15:44:16]&#160; I think 1 is warning, 2 is critical<br/>[14-Jul-2010 15:44:23]&#160;

yeah, that way we could eventually move it into the product<br/>[16-Jul-2010 11:01:40]&#160; well, you could always just keep it in your svn but allow it to be downloaded for the community zenpacks page<br/>[16-Jul-2010 11:01:43]&#160; not a huge deal<br/>[16-Jul-2010 11:01:59]&#160; mray: totaly clear. as you have a dual license you need to have all the rights.<br/>[16-Jul-2010 11:02:13]&#160; but first it needs cleanup.<br/>[16-Jul-2010 11:02:23]&#160;

so you get monthly calculated as the average of the last month's dailies<br/>[16-Jul-2010 13:42:15]&#160; sure, if you only query once a day, it should stay pretty tidy<br/>[16-Jul-2010 13:42:33]&#160; yeah, and you could just have a background task to populate the rrd<br/>[16-Jul-2010 13:42:37]&#160; so users never hit that query<br/>[16-Jul-2010 13:43:50]&#160; I'm not a coder, but it sounds like this would be fairly simple<br/>[16-Jul-2010 13:44:02]&#160;

and where did you put the transform?<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:35:07]&#160; did you put it at the root level as explained?<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:35:28]&#160; no, /Events/Status/Ping<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:35:40]&#160; it says right in that document to put it at the root level<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:35:53]&#160; so the odd functions he's using probably only work at that level<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:35:54]&#160; the root level one is for a different transform<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:36:07]&#160;

chemist: let me rewrite that for you real quick<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:37:09]&#160; I am trying to achieve= if device x at such location is ping down, suppress all other events for that location<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:38:23]&#160; ok, so router1.bellevue.datatote.co.uk is the head end router for the Belle Vue site I'd imagine<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:38:40]&#160; correct<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:38:44]&#160; I see what you're getting at, the code just isn't right, I don't see how this could have ever worked lol, I'll fix it up<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:39:02]&#160;

since that acknowledges the events<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:54:49]&#160; rather than moving them to history<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:55:04]&#160; or you could outright drop them, but that'll affect your availability stats<br/>[16-Jul-2010 15:57:23]&#160;

concert tonight then paintball tomorrow<br/>[16-Jul-2010 16:05:09]&#160; woot<br/>[16-Jul-2010 16:05:17]&#160; correct<br/>[16-Jul-2010 16:05:30]&#160; it's defining dc1_router as the "path" to that device<br/>[16-Jul-2010 16:05:37]&#160; which allows you to query it for properties<br/>[16-Jul-2010 16:05:45]&#160; which is why you're able to get the ping status<br/>[16-Jul-2010 16:05:52]&#160; so it can be any arbitrary name i want, instead of dc1_router<br/>[16-Jul-2010 16:05:53]&#160;

developer's guide<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:44:11]&#160; meant to say<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:45:54]&#160; lmao, my buddy just got a phonecall and the person said: "hello i was wondering if anyone in the household speaks creol"<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:46:02]&#160; just wow<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:46:27]&#160; creole*<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:48:03]&#160; that is wow<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:48:08]&#160; quote of the week tbh :P<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:48:13]&#160; and I've heard some doozies this week<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:48:15]&#160; :D<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:48:23]&#160; lol<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:50:01]&#160; how could I change the variables in email message format?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:50:04]&#160; database?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:50:15]&#160; with event transforms, if I drop an event, I take it it doesn't hit _any_ mysql db tables?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:50:18]&#160; what do you mean by change them?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:50:30]&#160; Simon4_: correcto<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:50:40]&#160; I get "%(eventUrl)s" as "localhost", obviously, a broken link<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:50:42]&#160; Simon4_: transforms are applied prior to events touching the database<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:50:47]&#160; rmatte: awesome :)<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:50:53] * Simon4_ prunes his messy db :)<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:51:12]&#160; chachan: then I suggest you update the hosts file<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:51:24]&#160; cachan: with a proper hostname<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:51:30]&#160; chachan*<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:51:46]&#160; chachan: zenactions.conf in $ZENHOME/etc will let you set the url to zope, which is then used in the url's in your alerts<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:52:05]&#160; Simon4_: thought it was set based on the hosts file by default<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:52:21]&#160; rmatte: yeah, that's useless if your zenoss install is behind a load balancer/etc/etc<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:52:28]&#160; true enough<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:52:29]&#160; so zenactions lets you set it to anything<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:52:45]&#160; good to know<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:52:53]&#160; I don't use email alerting much<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:53:15]&#160; we need less of it, it's a curse<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:53:16]&#160; Hey rmatte - that doc, it'll enable up/down info on ALL monitored interfaces correct?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:53:43]&#160; uhm, I'm on VPS, I think that hostname is managed by the VPS host and not for guess OS<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:53:49]&#160; arrrghhh: well, only if that datapoint is in the template for that interface type<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:53:52]&#160; so, I can't see my hostname O.o<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:53:55]&#160; arrrghhh: but yes<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:54:09]&#160; chachan: you can also go to "settings/daemons then click "edit config" on zenactions"<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:54:21]&#160; Cool, thanks again rmatte.<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:54:21]&#160; and set the zopeurl property<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:54:27]&#160; arrrghhh: np<br/>[20-Jul-2010 14:54:28]&#160; nice gui way to do it<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:05:40] &lt;|rt|&gt; I'm upgrading to 3.0 now....hopefully it will go smoothly...but figured since Zenoss isn't in production here yet it's a pretty safe upgrade<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:08:33]&#160; so simon4_ is there some graphical way of doing a modeler now?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:09:02]&#160; mducharme-laptop: no, you still have to write it, but as per the doc I linked, you create your skeleton zenpack using the GUI, then you can put your modeller into it<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:09:07]&#160; mducharme-laptop: modeler plugins are all code bud<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:09:32]&#160; ok so like before I copy DeviceMap.py into the zenpack<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:09:34]&#160; ?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:10:07]&#160; well obviously rename it if it's a duplicate of a plugin<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:10:13]&#160; you can't have 2 plugins named the same thing<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:10:17]&#160; well yes, I know<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:10:29]&#160; it will be called TrangoMap.py because I am modeling trango devices<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:10:32]&#160; and yes, copy it in to the plugins directory in the ZenPack<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:10:45]&#160; and make sure there's an __init__.py in that directory<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:15:21]&#160; ok<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:15:38]&#160; do I need to make an snmp directory inside plugins like there is in the main zenoss directory<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:15:40]&#160; or no<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:16:01]&#160; nope<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:17:43]&#160; ok there we go, I have my trangomap.py<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:22:37]&#160; what order should my plugin be in compared to the default ones<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:23:00]&#160; my collector plugin<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:23:07]&#160; it doesn't really matter, I tend to put mine at the bottom just out of habit<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:28:22]&#160; hey all<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:29:02]&#160; i have been trying to query wmi from zenoss, but have been failing. i can query wmi from wmiexplorer without issue, any ideas?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:30:34]&#160; sideone: well, what are you using in Zenoss to query it?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:31:34]&#160; rmatte, i have installed 2 packs, (that we spoke about yesterday), wmidatasource and wmiperf_windows<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:31:50]&#160; however, even prior to that install, i had issues with auth from zWin user and pass<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:31:53]&#160; i would imagine<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:33:07]&#160; did you make sure those are configured correctly?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:33:16]&#160; also, where did you put the device?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:33:20]&#160; under config properties, i have zWinuser as domain\user (user==domain admin), and zWinPassword as the correct password<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:33:45]&#160; i have tried putting it in server/win and another server under /cim/wmi<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:33:52]&#160; both seem to have the same issue.<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:33:58]&#160; /cim/wmi is where it needs to be<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:34:11]&#160; so don't put it anywhere other than there<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:34:27]&#160; can i move the server to another place?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:34:33]&#160; become zenoss user at the commandline and run: zenperfwmi run -v10<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:34:35]&#160; see what you get<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:34:36]&#160; from /server/win to cim/wmi<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:34:42]&#160; pl<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:34:43]&#160; ij<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:34:44]&#160; yes, move it<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:34:44]&#160; s/ok<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:35:34]&#160; hahah, sorry, is that a monitoring template? how do i move the server?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:35:50]&#160; just drag the device in to the class<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:35:57]&#160; I assume you're using 3.0?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:36:10]&#160; yes<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:36:17]&#160; yeh, just drag it<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:36:19]&#160; but im sorry, i dont know which screen allows for the drag<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:36:26]&#160; INFRASTRUCTURE<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:36:44]&#160; expand on the left until you see that organizer<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:36:49]&#160; sideone: is you overwrite template in /cim/wmi its bad<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:36:51]&#160; then drag the device from the list to that organizer<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:37:04]&#160; bigegor: I doubt he's over-written it<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:38:14]&#160; rmatte; i dragged, but under dev class, it still shows /server/windows after a refresh. does zen support firefox?<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:38:26]&#160; yes, it does<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:38:36]&#160; nm, im dum.<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:38:44]&#160; selected the row, and moved,<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:38:44]&#160; lol<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:38:48]&#160; i have too many plugins :)<br/>[20-Jul-2010 15:38:49]&#160;

oooh remeber the line we played with changed it to print o.getParentDeviceName<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:23:56]&#160; so hopefully I'll soon find what dev the reindex fails at<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:24:47]&#160; ah cool<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:25:14]&#160; or hmm maybe the device before since it fails :(<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:25:28]&#160; yeah, I was going from the "str is not callable" when I tried to print o<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:25:35]&#160; thinking that maybe it was a string, vs an object<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:28:07]&#160; wrapped it in try / except and printing self to see what that might give<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:30:48]&#160;&#160; was all I got<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:31:45]&#160; well might atleast be on the right track<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:35:32]&#160; ok now I have the object name that fails, can I somehow grab zenpacks and devices that has that object ?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:39:48]&#160; by the looks of it its a component in the hp mon zenpack, which kinda sucks<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:40:36]&#160; cpqSsChassis is an abstraction of a HP Storage System Chassis.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:40:38]&#160; you can try running that component cleaner snippet more times, and see if it gets picked up<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:40:54]&#160; that or you can get a little trickier<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:41:32]&#160; something like:<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:41:43]&#160;

then a reindex rebuilds the catalogues from what is really there<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:43:14]&#160; well I have my 2.5.2 backup<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:43:37]&#160; you can run zenbackup --no-eventsdb --no-perfdata and it's really quick<br/>[22-Jul-2010 07:44:01]&#160;

but I still dont get why I cant just readd the organizer<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:00:59]&#160; (from dmd)<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:01:10]&#160; it should solve the problem<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:01:18]&#160; tehhobbit: you can try.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:01:30]&#160; how do I do that ?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:02:04]&#160; do it through zope<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:02:12]&#160; 8080/zport/dmd/Devices<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:02:24]&#160;&#160; /manage_main<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:02:38]&#160; dropdownbox on the right, DeviceClass, Add<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:04:37]&#160; problem is its a sub organizer to storage and if I click the storage folder it fails<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:05:25]&#160; so I need some way to force it<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:05:44]&#160; so the storage folder is also f***<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:06:00]&#160; yes and I cant remove that either<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:07:06]&#160; sounds bad. what about restoring a point before you tried to migrate?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:09:02]&#160; yeah well suppose that could work<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:09:10]&#160; but a hell lot of trouble<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:09:39]&#160; is there no way to access the raw db and just remove the stuff of to create the folder from dmd<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:10:10]&#160; tehhobbit: there is no rawdb. zodb is an object database. it does not contain tables and rows.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:10:58]&#160; and if I try forcing creating deleting the folder<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:10:59]&#160; ?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:12:48]&#160; are there any hacks to get the status of Nagios plugins to show up in the Device Status list?&#160; ie. have one of those handy green dots show up when check_http says a webserver is functional<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:12:57]&#160; the developer manual is somewhat vague about this<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:13:10]&#160; fragfutter: just cant see how it would be impossible to remove data<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:13:56]&#160; tehhobbit: same as in a relational db. if you have a trigger and that one fails, it won't let you remove the data<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:14:06]&#160; I know the dev has a key called IBM<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:14:24]&#160; dammit<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:14:50]&#160; this is gonna be alot of extra work<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:14:52]&#160; tehhobbit: so in zope you take the object, wake it up and tell him "delete yourself" and the object says "wait, i'm important, don't delete me"<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:15:33]&#160; --force-I-dont-care switch ftw<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:16:09]&#160; tehhobbit: and run around and cry if you get lot's of other obsucre errors in a week.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:16:14]&#160; but how can the device not be deleteabel<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:16:40]&#160; yeah well<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:16:53]&#160; uninstall , back to 2.5 restore *sight*<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:18:45]&#160; well gives me some time to fix other stuff too<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:18:53]&#160; pretty shade install to start with<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:19:10]&#160; gone from testing to "hey lets make it prod" abit to fast<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:19:19]&#160; better to do it right this time<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:19:24]&#160; tehhobbit: i would assume a zenpack broke it.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:19:27]&#160; so not all bad<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:19:55]&#160; fragfutter: been playing around installing / uninstalling lots of stuff past month<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:20:16]&#160; tehhobbit: and some packs did not uninstall cleanly<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:20:34]&#160; the ibm one is broken with 3.0<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:21:59]&#160; gonna reinstall and fix some other stuff before readding the devices I think<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:23:02]&#160; btw might as while I'm at it , can I set a default collector for a certain network ?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:24:17]&#160; running single collector, no idea<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:24:49]&#160; tehhobbit: for when you discover devices? or just when you add them manually?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:25:09]&#160; discover<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:25:33]&#160; so you could run zendisc on the command line via cron or manually<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:25:33]&#160; fragfutter: been thinking about running a single one too<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:25:48]&#160; and if you then split the commands you can set the collector on the commandline for a specific network<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:26:16]&#160; because dual collectors with core version is alot of work<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:30:50]&#160; tehhobbit: I hadn't even though of that, setting up 1 collector is easy, but setting up 2 remote wouldn't be very simple to do<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:30:55]&#160; hmmm, actually<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:31:00]&#160; nah, it should be the same<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:31:02]&#160; now that I think of it<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:31:38]&#160; it's no harder to set up &gt;1<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:31:40]&#160; oh I just had 1 + main one<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:32:04]&#160; but cause me alot of grief anyways<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:34:28]&#160; yeh well, I don't think the guide for doing that in core is exactly perfect yet<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:34:29]&#160; everything from rpm packages wanting to run a ton of scripts , zenpacks being outof sync etc<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:34:51]&#160; I made my collector tool ZenPack based on the community guide, but I haven't had a chance to extensively test it to improve it<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:34:52]&#160; rmatte: no I know and you get it for enterprice<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:35:02]&#160; for one, I think the URL put in to the collectors section is incorrect<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:35:21]&#160; which egor pointed out to me at one point<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:35:26]&#160; haven't had a chance to test though<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:35:40]&#160; the most troublesome was that the standalone collector can see nets that the main one cant and when adding devs its done from the main server<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:36:17]&#160; tehhobbit: it shouldn't be done from the main server if you specify the alternate collector<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:36:20]&#160; if it is, then that's a bug<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:36:45]&#160; you need to specifically tell it to add the device using the other collector, and not just move it over to it after it's added<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:40:40]&#160; I think I did that but still the zendisc ran on the main one<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:40:58] * Simon4 had that problem also<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:41:16]&#160; I ended up just shelling into the collector and running zenmodeler manually on devices added on that collector<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:41:19]&#160; that worked<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:41:38]&#160; yeah same way I did it<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:41:54] * Simon4 hasn't tried that in enterprise yet actually<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:41:55] * Simon4 tries<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:42:10]&#160; would be a tad to expensive for us<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:42:44]&#160; my zenoss hardware arrived, hurrah!<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:42:51]&#160; woohoo<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:42:55]&#160; i wish 3.0 enterprise was out, because i don't want to install 2.5 and then have to upgrade immediately :)<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:43:19]&#160; think it will be some time until it comes out<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:43:41]&#160; I tried upgrading to the rc from the 2.5 test install i had and it didn't seem to work that great<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:43:41] * Simon4 is hoping that 3.0 enterprise comes out as 3.0.1 after all the community niggles are sorted<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:43:49]&#160; modelling servers didn't really work that well after<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:43:59]&#160; so maybe it's for the best that i'll use something older and established :)<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:44:54]&#160; Simon4: 3.0.1 will be Enterprise<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:45:51]&#160; ashp: the upgrade does have it's issues, but nothing that can't be overcome<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:46:14]&#160; rmatte: Sure, I just had no idea what I was doing, I just followed the instructions as best I could..<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:46:21]&#160; I'm sure by 3.0.1 it'll handle the upgrade just fine :)<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:46:27]&#160; if not i'll just start again<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:46:29]&#160; yeh, there's stuff outside the instructions<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:46:36]&#160; but that comes with experience<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:46:56]&#160; nah, I doubt 3.0.1 will handle the upgrade any better<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:46:59]&#160; the problem is ZenPacks<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:47:09]&#160; 3.0 uses Python 2.6<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:47:16]&#160; and all the ZenPacks are rigged to work with 2.4<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:47:25]&#160; some work fine after the upgrade, others need to be reinstalled<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:47:46]&#160; and when reinstalling them, the -py2.4 needs to be removed from the ZenPack filename<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:48:33]&#160; In my opinion, a migration script should have been created to smooth the ZenPack migration from version to version<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:48:36]&#160; but that was never done<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:49:32]&#160; I'm waiting on 3.0.1 to come out before I start creating a final upgrade guide for my servers<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:49:50]&#160; actually, I have trac tickets to log today, been putting it off<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:50:35]&#160; so basically it's going to be a nightmare to upgrade :)<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:50:44]&#160; ah well, it's never that easy<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:50:53]&#160; well, not a "nightmare", but complex for me at least<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:51:04]&#160; I have 14 Zenoss servers with 26 ZenPacks installed on each of them<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:51:18]&#160; Upgrades are always a lot of fun<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:51:18]&#160; yeah, i think you're in a much harder situation<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:51:35]&#160; the upgrade from 2.4 to 2.5 was no picnic either<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:52:10]&#160; i was hoping the server delay would be enough that we'd just dive right into 3.0 to save me the effort of tackling an upgrade early on :)<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:52:24]&#160; I'll end up just using the 2.5 install as more learning<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:53:23]&#160; it's up to you, I just don't personally see 3.0 as sufficient for my needs quite yet<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:53:33]&#160; I ordered a failover box in the hardware this time around, so upgrading will involve doing it alongside live, then failing people over to the "new" box I think<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:53:39]&#160; in-place sounds like it'll be tricky<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:53:41]&#160; especially since interface descriptions are no longer listed in the interface section<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:53:46]&#160; which is a major problem for me<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:54:15]&#160; but I guess that's what happens when you decide to have a side menu take up a quarter of the screen<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:54:35]&#160; no room for anything<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:55:06]&#160; yeah, the designers must all have desktops and 24-30" monitors<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:55:13]&#160; the columns should be configurable, and then there should be rollover popups which display detailed info about a given interface<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:55:15]&#160; on a laptop screen the new UI is incredibly cramped<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:55:22]&#160; that would be ideal for the new interface<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:55:46]&#160; I don't personally care to see IP and Mac Address info as columns, those would be fine as rollovers<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:55:55]&#160; but I absolutely need to see interface description as a column<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:56:22] * Simon4 nods<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:56:51]&#160; I'll be logging a trac about that shortly<br/>[22-Jul-2010 09:56:56]&#160; since it's a regression in my opinion<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:02:49]&#160; from earlier - the first 3.x enterprise release will be 3.0.1 and might be as early as next week<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:03:10]&#160; cool<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:03:52]&#160; cgibbons: i did not manage to get a clean ComponentGrid with url links. If i have links in the grid, the details page fails.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:05:18]&#160; it can be tricky<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:07:35]&#160; cgibbons: i may just stall in that case and wait<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:07:58]&#160; whatever you do, read the release notes before you upgrade<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:08:13]&#160; that apparently has been the source of a great number of issues in the 3.0 core version so far<br/><span>[22-Jul-2010 10:09:29]&#160; cgibbons: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastie.org/1055470">http://pastie.org/1055470</a><br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:09:46]&#160; cgibbons: would render it correct in the grid, but gives exception in the details page<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:10:59]&#160; you didn't make it a schema.Entity because it might there might not be an actual component found if it's an external, non-zenoss managed, thing on the other side of the link?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:11:26]&#160; cgibbons: yes.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:11:54]&#160; cgibbons: and i wouldn't know how to deal with a schema.Entity anyway ;)<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:12:21]&#160; When I've had that issue I've just had a blank column, but in your case you want to display something... Ian might have a suggestion for that. Ian: short-summary is that a property of this info object would normally be an entity, but sometimes it can just be a text value that needs to be displayed.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:13:16]&#160; You can't just send it through? I thought stuff was in there to just return the string<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:13:22]&#160; schema.Entity would be easy; you'd just return the component in the property, use the @info descriptor around the property function to get the Info object created automatically, and use Zenoss.render.default_uid_renderer in the grid column. but that doesn't handle (i think) the scenario if it's not there.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:13:25]&#160; a moment, checking the code<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:13:57]&#160; it might well be- so the .info object that finds the other entity would just return "foobar" instead of the other object and then the right things would happen? hmm that sounds right<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:14:10]&#160; most of that rendering code seems to be pretty smart about making sure it's got a uid or not<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:14:14]&#160; nope, you're right, it doesn't do the check. It should test for pathiness.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:14:24]&#160; Shoot, that's by far the easiest solution.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:14:49]&#160; Monkeypatch it in your pack<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:15:33]&#160; ashp: i think support has a document out for pre-release information for 3.0.x enterprise upgrades.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:16:33]&#160; iancmcc: i'm lost.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:17:37]&#160; wait. wt...<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:17:43]&#160; it's complicated unfortunately. ian &amp; i have a lot of insider knowledge of this code so it's hard to verbalize it all :)<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:17:45]&#160; why is this working now.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:17:58]&#160; magic<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:18:03]&#160; oh, cool, that'd be nice<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:18:12]&#160; fragfutter: one sec, I'm writing the modified method<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:20:16]&#160; fragfutter: You've got some custom javascript in your pack, I presume?<br/><span>[22-Jul-2010 10:20:22]&#160; if so, throw this at the top of it: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.ca/1906050">http://pastebin.ca/1906050</a><br/><span>[22-Jul-2010 10:20:53]&#160; and by that I meant </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://pastebin.ca/1906051">http://pastebin.ca/1906051</a><br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:24:40]&#160; iancmcc: it works without it. if i use an info object with decorated functions it works. if i use ProxyProperty it doesn't<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:25:19]&#160; fragfutter: Cool, because monkeypatching is a dark path that has no turning<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:25:33]&#160; yesterday i used ProxyProperty and that failed<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:27:56]&#160; iancmcc: if i want to specify that the component has no graphs, but instead should display details by default?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:28:23]&#160; the details thing is a bit tricky.

IpRouteEntry doesn't, which is presumably why it works<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:32:46]&#160; I bet if you take that out the graphs will disappear and you won't have to modify the info object at all<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:33:08]&#160; iancmcc: modified the info, restarted zenoss and it now works. it is only rather slow.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:33:30]&#160; iancmcc: so if you have time, i would ask you some more questions.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:36:22]&#160; a little bit<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:37:31]&#160; iancmcc: i model lldp links. during modelling i pull data with snmp. i know the local interface description, the remote management ip and the remote interface description.

If i find it, i use ip.getDeviceLink()<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:40:36]&#160; else display the string i found.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:41:33]&#160; the interface is trickier.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:41:45]&#160; ip.getDeviceLink() is old but will do for now<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:42:02]&#160; iancmcc: what should i use instead? ip.device().urlLink()?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:42:26]&#160; no, just send the device's uid and use schema.Entity<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:43:02]&#160; wherever possible don't allow html to be built server-side. It's terrible and we're weeding it out when we can<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:43:22]&#160; nonetheless yours is functional, but I can't guarantee that api being supported<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:43:38]&#160; iancmcc: ok. so i either send a string (if i don't find it) or i send a uid.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:44:05]&#160; yeah<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:45:10]&#160; iancmcc: i didn't understand the schema.Entity thing. so how would i do that?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:45:24]&#160; device has no attribute uid<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:45:29]&#160; actually you don't have to use schema.Entity.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:45:36]&#160; right, make it an info object<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:45:44]&#160; IInfo(device).uid<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:45:53]&#160; from Products.Zuul.interfaces import IInfo<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:46:57]&#160; so, sorry, you want this to display in your grid?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:46:59]&#160; or in the details?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:47:06]&#160; iancmcc: both<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:47:12]&#160; ah<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:47:21]&#160; so yeah, use schema.Entity in the interface<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:47:46]&#160; just like the previous field we were discussing. If you're returning a uid, it'll make it a link.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:48:21]&#160; iancmcc: i'll write some pastes.<br/>[22-Jul-2010 10:48:45]&#160; Gotta go to a meeting; I'll check it out after.<br/><span>[22-Jul-2010 10:48:52]&#160;

the stack installer never has you set the root mysql password so it either has a default password or generates and stores a random one somewhere<br/>[22-Jul-2010 12:15:09]&#160; |rt|: you using 2.5 or 3.0?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 12:15:32]&#160;

so you either need to get in to Zenoss, or open your Data.fs in a text editor and have fun combing through it<br/>[22-Jul-2010 12:18:40]&#160; the default password should be "zenoss"<br/>[22-Jul-2010 12:18:43]&#160;

drtic_cz: your best bet is to follow the steps in the install guide<br/>[22-Jul-2010 12:28:10]&#160; drtic_cz: just out of curiosity, why are you doing a source install in the first place?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 12:28:41]&#160;

I see<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:39:27]&#160; But not over VPN<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:39:33]&#160; and also vmware tools isn't running it says<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:39:39]&#160; perhaps you're going through different virtual interfaces?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:39:49]&#160;

oh<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:43:34]&#160; when I read the documentation it seemed to say that that is what those lights meant<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:43:34]&#160; they represent overall status (basically oper status), and whether or not that interface is set to be monitored or not<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:43:40]&#160; but it looked like the documentation was for an older version<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:43:41]&#160; ok<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:43:42]&#160; the documentation is outdated<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:43:45]&#160; it used to be that way<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:43:47]&#160; it was changed<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:43:49]&#160; ok<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:43:57]&#160; there's Status and the M column which means monitored<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:44:20]&#160; and if you do that interface polling setup it will change the status icon if an interface goes down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:44:30]&#160; that's the way I monitor interfaces<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:45:28]&#160; gahhhhh, I can not see why this collector plugin isn't working, I figured out the process function and fixed it<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:45:36]&#160;

unfortunately it's not so simple as just pulling it from snmp<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:56:35]&#160; the snmp value is either 0, 2, or 3 if it is down, and 1 if it is up<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:57:11]&#160; it will incorrectly read 3 as being up when it is down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 14:57:33]&#160;

the ethernet interface has no operational status<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:36:37]&#160; rmatte: Have I mentioned how much of a stud you are recently?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:36:53]&#160; however, it is what the connectivity to the device runs through, so the device will be unreachable if the ethernet interface is down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:37:22]&#160;

it's stupid that it doesn't show the operstatus via snmp<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:42:37]&#160; right, but how do I detect if the device goes down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:42:41]&#160; I will have to do a ping test<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:42:41]&#160;

so if that's the interface that you're actually hitting the device through it's a null issue<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:43:22]&#160; the su's are all in a nice table<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:43:34]&#160; but two interfaces are separate with totally different oids<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:43:42]&#160; right, standard OIDs<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:43:46]&#160; lol<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:43:59]&#160; and not even the same options for each one<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:44:06]&#160; they should<br/>[22-Jul-2010 15:44:12]&#160;

what is happening is I have a few interfaces that are administratively down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:08:38]&#160; those show as operationally down and put the device in error stage<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:08:53]&#160; then remodel so that Zenoss unmonitors them<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:09:02]&#160; it shouldn't even be monitoring those if they are admin down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:09:09]&#160; but you need it to remodel to pick up on that<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:09:56]&#160; I remodeled, same thing<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:11:10]&#160; do I have to manually change monitoring to disabled when adminstatus is down?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:11:40]&#160; are you absolutely sure that they are actually admin down and not just operationally down?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:11:53]&#160; the interfaces are completely disabled on the device?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:12:07]&#160; they are admin down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:12:17]&#160; then yeh, you might have to change the monitoring manually<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:12:18]&#160; Operational Status&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Down&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Administrative Status&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:12:22]&#160; though I don't see why you'd have to<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:12:33]&#160; it usually works fine for me<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:12:39]&#160; anyways, just disable them by hand<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:12:41]&#160; and that'll be that<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:14:01]&#160; hrm<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:14:11]&#160; I finally got the modeler to set the descriptions, but it's overwriting whatever the alias modeler does so I just need to come up with a solution for that and then I'm good to go<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:14:11]&#160; this will be annoying when we are going in adding all of our devices<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:14:33]&#160; when you're adding your devices it should automatically pick up on what's admin down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:14:36]&#160; it always does for me<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:14:37]&#160; to have to manually disable monitoring for the ports that are administratively disabled<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:14:45]&#160; if it doesn't pick up on it then it's not seeing it as truly being admin down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:14:48]&#160; should I try maybe deleting the device and readding it to see?<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:14:57]&#160; worth a shot<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:15:09]&#160; though it should have done it the first time<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:17:28]&#160; anyways, I'm done for the day<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:17:32]&#160; I'll be back tomorrow<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:18:32]&#160; ok<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:24:41]&#160; ok, I'm going to have to figure this out tomorrow I guess<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:25:02]&#160; I just modeled a device, and two interfaces where the status is down are showing with green lights in the list<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:26:35]&#160; check with snmpwalk to make sure they are actually operationally down integerwise<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:26:46]&#160; that's what Zenoss checks for<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:26:53]&#160; if snmp is reporting the wrong thing then that's the problem<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:28:31]&#160; it is a non standard oid for the operational status<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:28:42]&#160; I took care of it through the actual modeler script<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:28:49]&#160; then that's the problem<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:28:59]&#160; zenmodeler is looking for the standard OID<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:29:25]&#160; k<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:29:32]&#160; I have the modeler taking the correct one<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:29:37]&#160; it isn't the modeler, it's something else<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:29:42]&#160; well if you "took care of it" and it's still not working, then it wasn't done correctly<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:29:45]&#160; the modeler is correctly putting the interface as down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:29:56]&#160; there might be some other code that's specifically polling the status<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:30:04]&#160; yes.. that's what I'm thinking<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:30:07]&#160; you'd have to ask one of the devs<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:33:51]&#160; nice, now Zenoss suddenly just stopped even trying to use my plugin<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:34:35]&#160; oh I see why<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:34:41]&#160;

I had to manually set certain things<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:44:24]&#160; like the names of the eth0 and rf0 interfaces<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:45:04]&#160; and anything that wasn't alredy named, used the suid prefix with the id following it.. because no interface ids are available through snmp<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:45:53]&#160; I'm just working on getting it matching up the indexes properly right now<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:46:16]&#160; the loop of loops should cause it to loop through all possible combinations<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:46:27]&#160; yup<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:46:40]&#160; the problem is the way the plugin was originally designed doesn't quite jive<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:46:43]&#160; but I've almost got it fixed<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:47:28]&#160; yeah there has to be something else still pulling the adminstatus<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:48:27]&#160; it's all green.. yet those interfaces are administratively down.. and it's trying to graph the interface<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:50:39]&#160; I think I might finally have the indexes working properly<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:50:45]&#160; waiting for the model to finish to verify<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:51:04]&#160; then I just have to deal with the fact that it's overwriting what the InterfaceAliasMap plugin is down<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:51:06]&#160; doing*<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:51:19]&#160; so I either need to make it play nice with that plugin or just copy what that plugin does<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:51:31]&#160; I'll probably just make it copy it<br/>[22-Jul-2010 17:51:46]&#160;

it will rmatte, I think<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:18:09]&#160; mducharme-laptop: k, guess we'll see lol<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:18:09]&#160; the reason is, if the table ifalias has description, InterfaceMap pulls description from ifalias automatically<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:18:22]&#160; I don't know the exact line number from interfacemap<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:18:25]&#160; but I'm looking at it right now<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:18:29]&#160; k<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:18:41]&#160; I'm just waiting for the model to finish to find out<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:18:43]&#160; makes sense<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:18:59]&#160; nope, that didn't help<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:19:05]&#160; still just set the names with no descriptions<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:19:30]&#160; ok, you'll have to cange InterfaceMap.py then<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:19:33]&#160; I will tell you which line<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:19:52]&#160; I don't want to change it though lol<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:20:02]&#160; iftable[ifidx]['description'] = data.get('description', '')<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:20:10]&#160; hang on a minute<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:20:14]&#160; I have a better idea<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:20:17]&#160; k<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:20:20]&#160; of how to work around this<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:20:25]&#160; cool<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:20:33]&#160; I don't want to touch any of the actual Zenoss plugins<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:20:38]&#160; you won't have to<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:20:41]&#160; k cool<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:20:44]&#160; store the value in the ifalias table<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:21:06]&#160; sounds like a plan, didn't know you could do that though<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:21:42]&#160; # results[1]['ifalias'][i_idx]['description'] = catos['description']<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:21:48]&#160; ah<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:21:51]&#160; I'll give it a whirl<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:21:52]&#160; if the indexes match you can just do that<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:22:01]&#160; they do match<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:22:03]&#160; otherwise you will need to change your loops to loop through the ifalias table instead<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:22:03]&#160; ok<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:22:06]&#160; that's all been tested<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:22:10]&#160; ok<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:22:45]&#160; k, testing...<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:23:41]&#160; wham<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:23:43]&#160; that worked<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:23:46]&#160; thanks<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:23:51]&#160; cool<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:24:00]&#160; nice to return some help after all the help I've gotten<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:24:03]&#160; lol<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:24:27]&#160; I think I'll rename it to InterfaceCatOsMap, the current name is bit long lol<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:26:09]&#160; you might also want to add a comment that explains why you are pulling description from catos into ifalias :)<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:27:52]&#160; hmmm, I renamed the class, the file, but it's still only showing the old name in the UI<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:28:09]&#160; restarting zenoss is probably in order<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:30:34]&#160; there we go, that did it<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:30:35]&#160; sweet<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:31:11]&#160; so glad it's working, thanks again<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:33:30]&#160; I wish zenoss core had built in ldap support<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:33:50]&#160; well, I still haven't figured out how to set it up in 3.0<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:33:54]&#160; but once I do I'll write a guide<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:34:10]&#160; it wasn't hard to setup in 2.5<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:34:22]&#160; we are still using 2.5<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:34:26]&#160; just need to figure out how to do it with the newer versions of the plugins<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:34:32]&#160; not sure whether we should move to 3.0 yet, worried about glitches<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:34:49]&#160; what distro are you running on?<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:34:58]&#160; running the vmware appliance<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:35:01]&#160; ah<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:35:03]&#160; which runs on rpath<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:35:12]&#160; yeh, I'm not a big fan of the appliance<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:35:20]&#160; is it possible to edit a datasource for a local template on 3.0 within the device ?<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:35:23]&#160; it's great for trying it out, but I wouldn't use it for production<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:35:35]&#160; the problem with the appliance is it's not 64-bit<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:35:50]&#160; at some point we might want to move zenoss to a 64-bit vm<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:35:54]&#160; all I get when clicking on "view and edit details" is a page to test the datasource !<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:35:55]&#160; dec3pti0n: everything that was possible in 2.5 should still be possible, so in short, yes<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:36:08]&#160; dec3pti0n: really? that's odd<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:36:39]&#160; mducharme-laptop: I've never seen ldap setup on an appliance, so I'm not sure how involved it would be<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:36:47]&#160; yeah it's wierd cause I also get nothing on the black screen when I model a device . it's just stuck doing nothing<br/><span>[23-Jul-2010 14:37:17]&#160;

k<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:37:36]&#160; but it just looks to me like a hack<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:37:41]&#160; all my 2.5 boxes use ldap for auth<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:37:45]&#160; I'd be worried about upgrades breaking that<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:37:45]&#160; it's not a hack<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:37:52]&#160; it's a zope plugin<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:38:03]&#160; upgrades can break it, but it can always be fixed<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:38:10]&#160; just something you need to test before upgrading in production<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:38:44]&#160; that plugin is maintained alongside zope<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:39:05]&#160; I upgraded from 2.4 to 2.5 and it didn't break<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:39:10]&#160; but I know the 3.0 upgrade breaks it<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:39:23]&#160; newer version of zope, so newer version of plugin needed<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:39:31]&#160; but it looks like the plugin has changed substancially<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:42:00]&#160; ldap isn't a huge deal for us right now anyway<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:42:07]&#160;

I really wish zenoss had integrated ticketing<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:42:33]&#160; ah<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:42:37]&#160; that would solve so many issues for me<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:42:40]&#160; lol<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:43:01]&#160; we developed ticket system integration for otrs, but we can't release it<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:43:04]&#160; why are things like BMC the only integrated monitoring/helpdesk system<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:43:11] * rmatte shrugs<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:43:28]&#160; generally because people know what ticketing system they want to use and do the integration themselves<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:43:31]&#160; your ticket system integration just uses email I imagine<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:43:36]&#160; nope<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:43:37]&#160; API<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:43:44]&#160; ahh so you're using the soap api<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:43:48]&#160; the tickets are generated via SOAP<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:44:02]&#160; yes, i was looking at coding that<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:44:12]&#160; there's a perl script that my manager wrote which generates the tickets<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:44:15]&#160; and I wrote this...<br/><span>[23-Jul-2010 14:44:25]&#160;

it behaves like any other zenoss daemon, can start/stop it from the UI and everything<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:46:12]&#160; right<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:46:22]&#160; why did your manager write a perl script to generate the tickets<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:46:31]&#160; you can use the soap api from python directly<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:47:00]&#160; yeh I know, we were originally just using the commands section of the event manager in Zenoss to kick off the perl script (he's more comfortable coding in perl)<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:47:12]&#160; right<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:47:15]&#160; but it only kicked off when an event count was 1, and was extremely tedious to configure<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:47:26]&#160; so I decided to write the daemon and use the existing script<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:47:32]&#160; can I use your script there and add on python based integration?<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:47:36]&#160; the ticket create script is really complex, I didn't want to have to recreate it<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:47:53]&#160; yeh, I can send you the actual ZenPack tomorrow<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:47:56]&#160; ermn<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:47:59]&#160; on Monday<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:47:59]&#160; rather<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:48:42]&#160; we heavily customized otrs though<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:48:42]&#160; ok cool<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:48:50]&#160; added fields to it, redesigned the queue view<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:49:08]&#160; do you use the ITIL version?<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:49:10]&#160; our ticket create script has all sorts of auto-correlation and stuff built in to it<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:49:13]&#160; or rather the ITSM version<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:49:20]&#160; yeh, we use ITSM modules<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:49:33]&#160; I actually just finished porting all our customizations from 2.3 to 2.4<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:49:38]&#160; so we'll be upgrading soon enough<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:49:43]&#160; yeah I was going to say, that would minimize the customization that you would have to do<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:49:49]&#160; yeh<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:49:54]&#160; the ITSM modules are godly<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:49:59]&#160; the new change system module is awesome<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:50:01]&#160; because ITSM has a lot more stuff in it<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:51:16]&#160; yeah<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:51:30]&#160; that's what i want to integrate somewhat with the zenoss cmdb<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:53:05]&#160; I do not need a lot of information<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:53:27]&#160; what I ideally want is each device from zenoss replicated into the OTRS DB<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:53:31]&#160; but not all the details<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:54:27]&#160; probably just name, ip address and a web url link<br/><span>[23-Jul-2010 14:54:48]&#160;

that's why I want to sync the cmdb's<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:56:38]&#160; yeh<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:56:45]&#160; we didn't do it that way unfortunately lol<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:56:49]&#160; I would imagine that is what your customizations do<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:56:53]&#160; we have a seperate cmdb<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:57:08]&#160; what do you store for the devices themselves<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:57:16]&#160; in otrs<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:57:18]&#160; not very much I assume<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:57:19]&#160; nothing<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:57:27]&#160; we have links that go off to other things<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:57:38]&#160; like if you click on the device name in the queue it brings you right to the device in zenoss<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:57:41]&#160; stuff like that<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:57:52]&#160; there's links to go straight to relevant documentation for a given customer<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:58:20]&#160; there's an iframe if you open a ticket that gives you info on the device taken from the cmdb<br/>[23-Jul-2010 14:59:52]&#160; rmatte yeah, that's pretty much what I'm planning on setting up, only using the cmdb<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:00:02]&#160; cool<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:00:11]&#160; what I'm going to do is prefix all the cmdb classes with ZENOSS::<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:00:14]&#160; for the imported ones<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:00:19]&#160; cool<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:00:27]&#160; that way I won't run into naming issues with zenoss -&gt; otrs<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:00:31]&#160; yeh<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:00:56]&#160; we have a script that compares the names in Zenoss to the ones in OTRS and send an email report with any issues it finds<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:01:01]&#160; there's one thing I was curious about however<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:01:03]&#160; erm<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:01:06]&#160; to the ones in cmdb rather<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:01:29]&#160; ?<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:02:00]&#160; because your script calls a perl script to create the tickets, it has to store the config (which is likely I assume the soap url, username and password for otrs)<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:02:12]&#160; the config I see is in a config file<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:02:23]&#160; as it would have to be to be accessible by perl<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:02:37]&#160; is there a facility where zProperties could be added into a zenpack<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:02:56]&#160; no, everything is passed to the perl script via commandline options<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:02:57]&#160; so that the OTRS soap url, username and password could be set in the gui<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:03:09]&#160; perl doesn't actually see the config script of the daemon<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:03:14]&#160; ok<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:03:15]&#160; config file rather<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:03:31]&#160; so, is it possible to have parameters in a zenpack?<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:03:39]&#160; instead of bundling a config file<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:03:45]&#160; or manually creating one in etc<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:03:52]&#160; the config file isn't really "bundled"<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:04:05]&#160; a generic config file is generated the first time the daemon is run<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:04:16]&#160; or if it finds that a config file doesn't exist<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:04:31]&#160; right, but where does it pull the soap url, username and password from<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:04:42]&#160; the config data has to be stored somewhere<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:04:49]&#160; that's all harcoded in to the perl script that it's calling<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:04:53]&#160; it doesn't need any of that<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:05:00]&#160; right<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:05:09]&#160; and I'm asking if instead of hardcoding it, it's possible to have zproperties storing those<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:05:22]&#160; you could do that, yes<br/>[23-Jul-2010 15:05:32]&#160;

I understand Zenoss is OSS but these days that means very little... Would you say Zenoss gives as many features to users of the community edition as it does the enterprise version?<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:30:31]&#160; well, we just decided to go with the enterprise version but really the only difference are some nice premade modules<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:30:42]&#160; you could, i believe, build exactly the same stuff yourself on the community version<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:31:12]&#160; which modules?<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:31:42]&#160; they have a really nice vmware module, which is one of the major attractions to me<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:31:53]&#160; that has all kinds of bundled reports and so forth, there's a netapp one, some others<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:32:13]&#160; so access to a module repository is granted in the enterprise edition<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:32:16]&#160; but all modules are OSS ?<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:32:46]&#160; i would think the enterprise modules are not OSS, but the community ones are.. I've only just finished doing a brief eval of zenoss so I'm no expert<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:33:21]&#160; i'll be honest, i've been doing linux stuff for over ten years now and I just don't care about OSS vs other licences in any way, so I can't answer most of this<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:34:18]&#160; I care about companies that create a community edition and make parts of their code OSS...simply to gain new business and not to offer any real support for the community at all<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:34:34]&#160; basically the new "Freeware" ... but the community helps them write the code for them<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:35:13]&#160; I guess I'd say, "hey, some OSS code is better than no OSS code and nobody makes the community write or do anything unless it benefits them too"<br/>[25-Jul-2010 18:35:20]&#160;

that does seem like a plausible reason, I would say<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:28:29]&#160; hi everyone, I'm getting networking issues, so my ping fail often. I would like to check a log where I can look at the timeout so I can tune on my zenping. Where could I search for this?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:32:01]&#160; zenping.log, I found it, thanks :D<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:32:10]&#160; anytime ;)<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:33:07]&#160; looking over all the code for zensyslog, I'm left thinking it's probably safer to add a second mode of operation. the first is the normal zensyslog sink mode, the other is to take messages in from a relaying syslog host<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:33:57]&#160; it's a relatively trivial code change in terms of how to parse each of those, but the tricky part comes in if you need to decide if a message is one or the other<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:34:22]&#160; reckon I should maybe ask this question on zenoss-dev?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:34:54]&#160; zenoss-dev is usually empty except on thursdays<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:35:20]&#160; #zenoss-dev, or zenoss-dev?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:35:26]&#160; oh, the channel I meant<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:35:29]&#160; (I was thinking of the mailing list/forum)<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:35:30]&#160; you can ask in the forums section<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:45:32]&#160; I only get this: WARNING zen.ZenPing: ip 1.2.3.4 is down<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:46:03]&#160; but I don't get timeout or any information else, could I extend this log?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 10:46:14]&#160; how*<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:00:22]&#160; chachan: it's not actually doing a "ping" like you'd do from the commandline<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:00:30]&#160; so you're not going to get TTL info and such<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:00:43]&#160; it's simply telling you that the device is unreachable via ping<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:00:55]&#160; If you need more detailed info use the fping ZenPack<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:01:21]&#160; I don't personally see the point though<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:04:31]&#160;

hey rmatte<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:15:32]&#160; you said you could send me a zenpack for the zenticket daemon?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:15:56]&#160; also who was that guy you said I should ask for which zenpacks have zproperties in them<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:16:07]&#160;

I need to get something back to justify sending it to you lol<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:20:29]&#160; (Just so I have something to tell management if they were to find out)<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:21:00]&#160; anyways, I'm off to lunch, bbiab<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:34:32]&#160; ok, yes of course I would sen dyou the completed pack when I'm done<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:34:42]&#160; what I want to do is get the pack with parameters and instructions<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:34:48]&#160;

relatively :)<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:41:43]&#160; the zproperties I would have would be system-wide<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:41:51]&#160; meaning the would not be device zproperties or whatever<br/>[26-Jul-2010 11:42:03]&#160;

hurm<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:38:09]&#160; guys, is there a doc where i can lear a bit about ldap and roels and groups in zenoss?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:38:25]&#160; i read that only enterprise is quite granular on permissions<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:38:38]&#160; yeh, core is not very granular<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:38:44]&#160; and there isn't really any good document covering that<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:38:59]&#160; you're really stuck with just users or admins<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:39:06]&#160; yep.. im reading and not getting it.. hehe<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:39:10]&#160; ok<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:39:36]&#160; so all ldap groups that it imports wont really be useful<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:39:57]&#160; such as?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:40:15]&#160; i imported from my AD.. sorry<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:41:21]&#160; and i get a bunch of groups like devs, wiki, and more.. most dont have to interact with zenoss but was just wondering<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:42:55]&#160; When I get an IP down event, if the device comes back up that down event should clear... right?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:43:00]&#160; JonnyV: oh, it probably pulled those down from your LDAP server<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:43:06]&#160; they were probably already on there<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:43:14]&#160; what you do is assign an LDAP group to a role<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:43:20]&#160; so that anyone in that group gets that role<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:44:02]&#160; ok.. so the autorization is based on only the 3 roles zenoss provides<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:44:18]&#160; unless you want to create a new role, but good luck with that<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:44:24]&#160; there's like 100 checkboxes<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:44:27]&#160; haha<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:45:24]&#160; i dont think so.. too newbie with zenoss.. first im trying to figure out how to map/organize my infrastructure<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:45:51]&#160; pity on the roles... all other features are quite awesome<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:45:53]&#160; also, it's really only 2 roles<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:45:57]&#160; do not user ZenManager<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:46:02]&#160; just use ZenUser and Manager<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:46:34]&#160; well, LDAP isn't even officially supported in Core<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:46:44]&#160; by the way, do you have LDAP working in 3.0?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:47:04]&#160; or 2.5.2?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:52:28]&#160; on 3.0 rmatte<br/>[26-Jul-2010 13:55:27]&#160; Sorry damn phone took a digger.&#160; Basically I came in this morning and Zenoss said 280 some odd devices were down, when I could ping them from within Zenoss.&#160; I just restarted the zenoss-stack, is that normal?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:02:06]&#160; arrrghhh: that's obviously not normal<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:04:32]&#160; eugh, what the heck am I missing here<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:04:48]&#160; I have these Cisco UCOS devices that I'm trying to monitor processes on<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:05:03]&#160; they provide a full hrSWRun table just like a Linux server would<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:05:10]&#160; but Zenoss isn't detecting the processes<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:11:49]&#160; Rmatte, we had some network hardware fail over during the weekend<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:13:13]&#160; I'm sure that's the cause of all these devices listed as down, I just want to know why they were still listed as down this morning...<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:13:40]&#160; because Zenoss wasn't able to ping them<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:13:49]&#160; that's the only reason why they would have still been listed as down<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:14:09]&#160; zenping wasn't able to ping them<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:14:11]&#160; for whatever reason<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:14:20]&#160; I've never had a problem like what you're describing<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:15:48]&#160; I could ping them<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:16:04]&#160; But zenping could not... that doesn't make sense to me.<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:17:27]&#160; how do I install a zenpack in develoment mode<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:17:50]&#160; er development mode<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:21:41]&#160; figured it out<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:21:46]&#160; So why could the zenoss gui ping the device and zenping could not?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:24:40]&#160; zenping is not actually using the ping command<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:24:50]&#160; when you're doing it from the gui it's just using the ping command<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:25:01]&#160; Zenoss uses twisted to perform it's network tests including pings<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:25:13]&#160; I've seen cases where I could ping a device using the ping command but zenping couldn't<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:25:20]&#160; something to do with packets<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:25:26]&#160; and the way they are handled<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:25:55]&#160; Well this happened last time this core network device failed over<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:26:08]&#160; I had to restart zenoss, it was full of red!<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:26:33] Simon4_ is now known as Simon4<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:26:49]&#160;

was it for more than a day?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:28:19]&#160; I think so<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:28:24]&#160; Let me look<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:28:26]&#160; then I know what your problem was<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:28:41]&#160; Collectors -&gt; localhost -&gt; Maximum Ping Failures<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:28:48]&#160; by default it's set to 24 hours I believe<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:28:55]&#160; Oh<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:29:00]&#160; meaning if ping failures reaches that count it stops monitoring the device entirely<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:29:06]&#160;

which effectively disables it<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:29:57]&#160; also, once it stops monitoring it there is no indication in the UI that it has done so<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:09]&#160; It was set to 1440<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:09]&#160; and the only way to get it to monitor it again is to either remodel the device or restart Zenoss<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:16]&#160; right, 1440 is the default<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:16]&#160; Damn<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:26]&#160; That sounds like what happened...<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:31]&#160; it's really stupid, I found that out about 7 months ago and I flipped<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:37]&#160; we missed an outage because of it<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:45]&#160; since I thought it was monitoring a device when it actually wasn't<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:47]&#160; I'm really freakin glad this isn't in production<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:52]&#160; lol<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:55]&#160; Yea, that sucks!<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:30:58]&#160; that's the dumbest thing in Zenoss<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:31:08]&#160; they should default it to 0 and make that disable it<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:31:11]&#160; but it doesn't<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:31:12]&#160; Ah well.&#160; At least it's easily fixed<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:31:20]&#160; Agreed...<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:31:21]&#160; you need to set it to: 99999999999 or whatever<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:31:40]&#160; I opened a trac ticket for it but I think they might have just closed it out at some point<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:31:43]&#160; I'll check<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:31:43]&#160; I filled the box with 9's basically haha<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:31:56]&#160; actually I think Matt opened a ticket for it after I mentioned it<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:32:01]&#160; I don't think it ever went anywhere<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:32:11]&#160; yeh, that's what I did too<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:33:09]&#160; Lol my data point graph looks really good for that last 12 hr period haha<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:33:22]&#160; I'll bet<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:33:23]&#160; lol<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:34:08]&#160; I know most of Zenoss' little quirks like that<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:34:10]&#160; Ugh I definitely need more powerful hardware<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:34:15]&#160; that's the worst for new users who don't know about it<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:34:35]&#160; I should make a "10 things you should know when starting to use Zenoss" style document for the wiki<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:34:39]&#160; and include that on there<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:34:58]&#160; or they could just do what they should have done and set it to 0 by default to disable it :P<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:35:42]&#160; the justification that one of the devs gave me was "If I have a server that's down for over a day, and I know that server is down, I don't want Zenoss to keep alerting me about it"<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:35:51]&#160; and I was like "That's what production states are for, durrrr"<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:36:10]&#160; lol<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:37:10]&#160; 1440 / 60 == 24<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:37:17]&#160; so yeh, it is 24 hours by default<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:37:35]&#160; Ah<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:37:50]&#160; So there is no way to truly disable it then?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:38:01]&#160; other than setting it to 999999999999, nope, not currently<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:38:07]&#160; I would think 0 would completely disable that "feature"<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:38:11]&#160; Huh<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:38:18]&#160; hopefully the trac ticket that was opened for it is still open<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:38:23]&#160; yeh, you'd think so, but it doesn't<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:38:25]&#160; we tested it<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:38:36]&#160; How long will it stop monitoring that device for?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:38:45]&#160; until it's remodeled or Zenoss is restarted<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:38:50]&#160; Oy<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:38:55]&#160; and there's absolutely no indication that it's no longer monitoring it<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:38:59]&#160; which is the really scary part<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:39:08]&#160; Does zenoss remodel automatically at all?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:39:12]&#160; you'd expect at least a notification or a special icon on the device or something<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:39:26]&#160; yes, by default it remodels automatically every 12 hours<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:39:32]&#160; I personally disable the automated remodelling<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:39:33]&#160; Ok<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:39:53]&#160; Collectors -&gt; localhost -&gt; Modeler Cycle Interval<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:40:02]&#160; that's where you can adjust how often it auto-remodels<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:40:40]&#160; I never did get the automatic device adding to work... i'd like that to run once a week or a month, do you do anything like that?<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:41:05]&#160; oh crap, I was supposed to log my time in our CRM system by today, whoops<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:41:08]&#160; time to get cracking on that<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:41:30]&#160; arrrghhh: no, automatic device adding is a nightmare<br/>[26-Jul-2010 14:41:46]&#160;

Ever since I upgraded to 3.0, I get an attribute error for 'zProdStateThreshold' whenever I try to view multi-graph reports or create new multi-graph reports.&#160; Anyone have that problem or something similar?

I could manually go to a command prompt and go into the log directory<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:06:09]&#160; and touch the file<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:06:18]&#160; that's not what I mean<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:06:55]&#160; cat $ZENHOME/bin/zenticket<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:07:07]&#160; that's part of the zenpack<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:07:15]&#160; and it creates the config file the first time you start the daemon<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:07:26]&#160; or if the config file goes missing<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:10:00]&#160; no such file or directory<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:10:14]&#160; you did actually install the pack correctly right?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:10:20]&#160; yup<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:10:22]&#160; that link should have been automatically created upon installation<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:10:41]&#160; wait...<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:10:45]&#160; are you the zenoss user right now<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:10:48]&#160; or some other user?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:10:59]&#160; you need to be the zenoss user for $ZENHOME to resolve to a directory<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:11:00]&#160; zenoss user<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:11:02]&#160; I know<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:11:14]&#160; k, then I don't see how you could have installed the pack properly if that link is missing<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:11:26]&#160; i will release next version of WMIPerf_Windows ZenPack, can somebody test actual SVN version of this ZenPack<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:11:29]&#160; after installing the pack you should be able to do: zenticket start<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:11:33]&#160; and have it start the daemon<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:11:45]&#160; if you can't do that, then it's not installed properly<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:12:12]&#160; I can't do that<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:12:28]&#160; anyways...<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:12:34]&#160; in the ZenPack's zenpack directory<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:12:37]&#160; check out...<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:12:41]&#160; ZenPacks.Nova.Ticket.Daemon-2.1-py2.4.egg/ZenPacks/Nova/Ticket/Daemon/daemons/zenticket<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:12:52]&#160; that's the script that normally starts the daemon and creates the config file<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:13:02]&#160; you don't need to have the daemon itself create the config file<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:13:04]&#160; yes, I see that file there<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:13:05]&#160; there's no point<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:13:37]&#160; and that file gets linked to $ZENHOME/bin/zenticket automatically upon successful installation of the pack<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:13:45]&#160; so if it didn't get linked, then it's not installed properly<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:13:56]&#160; ok<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:14:05]&#160; the proper way to edit the pack is to do the following...<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:14:09]&#160; install the pack normally<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:14:12]&#160; for starters<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:14:21]&#160; no linking or any of that nonsense<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:14:34]&#160; I'm installing it through the web interface<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:14:35]&#160; using install zenpack<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:14:38]&#160; that's not the normal way?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:15:05]&#160; that should work<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:15:14]&#160; how did you convert the pack to developer mode?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:15:27]&#160; there was a cp command on the website<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:15:42]&#160; copying files from the zentemplate directory or something to the zenpack dir<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:15:47]&#160; ok, I don't understand how the link didn't get created in $ZENHOME/bin<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:16:01]&#160; what exactly is supposed to create the link?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:16:04]&#160; I've tested the pack in 2.5 and 3.0, the link always gets created<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:16:08]&#160; zenoss does it itself<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:16:20]&#160; there's an automated routine to create a link to whatever is in the daemons directory<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:16:37]&#160; maybe it's because I'm now overriding class zenpack<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:16:44]&#160; probably<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:16:48]&#160; to set zproperties<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:17:05]&#160; you'll probably have to code in the linking yourself then<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:17:18]&#160; let me get you an example of what to put in __init__.py...<br/>[27-Jul-2010 11:17:22]&#160;

|rt|: the %s get replaced with the contents of the variables, understand?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 12:58:11]&#160; I have scripts on the ZenOSS box that queries remote NRPE<br/>[27-Jul-2010 12:58:31]&#160; straterra: you need to create a command datasource<br/>[27-Jul-2010 12:58:39]&#160; straterra: that's detailed in the admin guide<br/>[27-Jul-2010 12:58:52]&#160; kk<br/>[27-Jul-2010 12:59:40] &lt;|rt|&gt; let me have a look<br/>[27-Jul-2010 12:59:59]&#160; What term should I look for in the document? command datasource doesn't show anything<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:00:26] &lt;|rt|&gt; rmatte: what's the 3rd parameter in that getattr function call?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:00:47] &lt;|rt|&gt; that says 'Unknown' do I need to replace that with the event class?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:04:39]&#160; |rt|: that just means that if it's not able to actually grab a value it will set the variable to "Unknown" instead of just empty<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:04:43]&#160; it's optional<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:04:58] &lt;|rt|&gt; ah ok...now is that python or TALES?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:05:03]&#160; python<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:05:08]&#160; TALES is not used in transforms<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:05:14]&#160; transforms are pure python<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:05:14] &lt;|rt|&gt; ah ok<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:05:25] &lt;|rt|&gt; thanks again<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:05:28]&#160; TALES is for things like reports<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:05:29]&#160; np<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:06:41] &lt;|rt|&gt; there's not a way to test a transform with a test event is there?&#160; b/c those variables won't have a value....well I guess it will just say unknown at that point<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:07:05]&#160; I don't think transforms get applied to test events<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:07:07]&#160; in my experience<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:07:12]&#160; only real way to test is with a real event<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:07:27]&#160; especially for things like traps<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:07:33] &lt;|rt|&gt; I guess we sit and wait :)<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:07:41]&#160; show me your end code<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:07:48]&#160; I can tell you whether it'll work or not<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:07:54]&#160; this is a really simple transform<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:08:10] &lt;|rt|&gt; yeah I only edited the text in the summary string from what you sent<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:08:11]&#160; also, when you save a transform, if the code is bad the text will turn red<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:08:17]&#160; if that happens, you have some sort of error in the code<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:08:19]&#160; just a tip<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:08:24] &lt;|rt|&gt; ok good to know<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:08:29]&#160; you left the %s right?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:08:32] &lt;|rt|&gt; yeah<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:08:38]&#160; the first %s is the first variable, second is the second<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:08:48]&#160; and you could add a third or whatever if you had a third variable<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:08:56]&#160; pretty straightforward<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:09:16] &lt;|rt|&gt; yeah....I just didn't know how to access the variables from the event<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:09:37]&#160; so rmatte should i open a bug or something for that issue with the UI ? i really dont mind, but if it helps i have no problem with that<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:11:16]&#160; rmatte: I'm adding a datasource..but don't really know what Component means..or event key..or anye of that<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:11:28]&#160; Do you know where in the documentation it is?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:12:04]&#160; straterra: you can just leave those blank<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:12:55]&#160; straterra: components would be shown in the component column in the event queue<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:13:06]&#160; eventKey is just an event property<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:13:09]&#160; both are optional<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:13:16]&#160; What about event class?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:13:30]&#160; event class should be set to whatever event class you feel is relevant<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:13:43]&#160; And command template?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:13:45]&#160; If it's a CPU OID you'd set it to /Perf/CPU for instance<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:03]&#160; /cmd/fail works, I guess<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:11]&#160; where do you see command template?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:17]&#160; are you using the new UI or the old one?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:22]&#160; In the data source<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:24]&#160; I've yet to make a template in the new UI<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:35]&#160; I'm on 2.5..so..<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:37]&#160; ah<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:39]&#160; old UI<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:41]&#160; Yeah<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:47]&#160; let me look for myself so i actually see what you see<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:50]&#160; kk<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:14:55]&#160; trying to do this off the top of my head is half-assed lol<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:15:35]&#160; command template is the actual command you want to execute<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:15:41]&#160; the script<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:15:52]&#160; and you would pass info to it<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:15:55]&#160; an example...<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:16:07]&#160; /libexec/wincpu.sh "${dev/manageIp}" "${dev/zSnmpCommunity}"<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:16:33]&#160; that would execute wincpu.sh from the libexec directory and pass the IP of the device the SNMP string of the device as arguments to the script<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:16:41]&#160; Right<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:17:04]&#160; So..how do I define good or bad output?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:17:18]&#160; well, that's where the script itself comes in<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:17:24]&#160; first off, what does the script do exactly?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:17:36]&#160; Checks two servers postgres databases to make sure slony is working properly<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:17:53]&#160; When both databases match, it returns an ok status..when they dont, it tells how many records one is lagging by<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:17:54]&#160; ok, and if it's not it throws some sort of error?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:18:02]&#160; I see<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:18:10]&#160; so what you'd want the script to do is this...<br/><span>[27-Jul-2010 13:18:13] &lt;|rt|&gt; rmatte: I edited the example you gave me online to reflect my changes I dont' think there's any reason for it not to work.&#160; </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://fpaste.org/PO3N/">http://fpaste.org/PO3N/</a><br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:18:19]&#160; if everything is ok, have it output: OK|<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:18:22]&#160; and exit normally<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:18:37]&#160; if something is wrong have it output: WHATEVER ERROR YOU WANT|<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:18:43]&#160; and have it exit with an exit code of 1 or 2<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:18:50]&#160; The script gives different exit codes, I'm told<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:19:03]&#160; It's an old nagios script, heh<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:19:03]&#160; well then just make sure the output is nagios format<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:19:06]&#160; STATUS|<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:19:09]&#160; ah<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:19:12]&#160; then it'll work fine<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:19:28]&#160; Zenoss handles Nagios scripts<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:19:42]&#160; so just have the command datasource execute it properly with any arguments that it needs (if any)<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:19:48]&#160; and let er' rip<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:23:02]&#160; cgibbons: navigate to Infrastructure -&gt; Networks -&gt; then click on the options menu in the bottom left... very funny<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:23:08]&#160; so many choices<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:23:33]&#160; actually hmmm, it only does it when you're on one of the networks<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:23:37]&#160; click on a network folder, then check it<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:23:51]&#160; hmmm, it's not doing it anymore<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:23:59]&#160; it was saying "Discover Devices" 3 times<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:24:03] * rmatte attempts to recreate<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:24:27]&#160; hmmm, guess it was a fluke, odd<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:25:13]&#160; Works<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:25:23]&#160; Can I change the Definition path once I've created it?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:25:35]&#160; which definition path?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:25:46]&#160; For the new template I made with the datasource<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:26:05]&#160; It's under /Devices right now and I need it for /Devices/Server/Linux/ERP<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:26:14]&#160; yes, you can move it freely<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:26:19]&#160; it won't affect anything<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:26:43]&#160; although I'd say just leave it at /Devices and bind it at the level that you need it at<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:26:45]&#160; works just the same<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:26:50]&#160; oh, ok<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:26:57]&#160; either that or copy it to the level you want it at and delete it from /Devices<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:26:58]&#160; up to you<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:29:50]&#160; So..where in the device can I check the status of that datasource?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:30:07]&#160; you can't, it'll just generate an alert if something goes wrong<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:30:11]&#160; ah, ok<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:30:12]&#160; if it doesn't, then all is well<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:30:43]&#160; well, what does the actual output of that script look like?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:31:15]&#160; you might be able to graph some data, depending on what the output looks like<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:31:21]&#160; but they may not have scripted it to provide any<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:35:33]&#160; It's text<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:35:45]&#160; Later I'll make it output just numbers to have it graph<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:35:52]&#160; Thanks for the help...you're a life saver<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:37:12]&#160; Hi friends, I was reading the developer's guide, looking for how to create events using python, so in an example, it says that I can import the library using Products.ZenEvents.ZenEventClasses<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:37:53]&#160; but, I found PBDaemon in Products.ZenHub.PBDaemon, is that the same?<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:39:48]&#160; look at $ZENHOME/bin/zensendevent<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:40:29]&#160; chachan: don't forget about zensendevent if you just need something quick<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:43:01]&#160; mray, well, I don't need something quick, I need to connect to a database, parse some web services, connect via ssh to another server, etc<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:45:23]&#160; so, I found it in a different location from what the guide show me<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:48:34]&#160; straterra: np<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:49:28]&#160; chachan: they are saying to actually look at the code for zensendevent<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:49:32]&#160; since it creates events<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:49:42]&#160; ;)<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:56:21]&#160; guys can u point me an easy, "long" explained alerts creation and capabilities guide? im reading the admin guide now<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:59:09]&#160; JonnyV, you can create alerts to users and groups through "Advanced" &gt; "Users", choose an user or group and go to "Alerting Rules"<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:59:49]&#160; so, you can create alerts through it<br/>[27-Jul-2010 13:59:58]&#160; yeps.. im there..<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:00:23]&#160; cool.. the groups one is interesting<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:00:47]&#160; so i dont tie alerts to users that can be deleted right<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:01:41]&#160; but im looking for more detailed info. will investigate the events info on the admin guide.<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:04:34]&#160; JonnyV: well, don't delete users unless necessary and you won't have issues with the alerts lol\<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:04:44] mrayzenoss is now known as mray<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:05:34]&#160; hehe.. yeah.. iknow.. but maybe when i leave the company they delete my account.. hehe<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:05:50]&#160; then tough luck for them<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:05:51]&#160; lol<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:05:59]&#160; hahaha<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:06:00]&#160; yeaa<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:06:12]&#160; i'm thinking right now that i dont care that much<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:06:13]&#160; that falls under the category of something you'd want to explain before leaving<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:06:14]&#160; haha<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:06:35]&#160; will depend on how i leave... hehe<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:06:59]&#160; i will create groups then<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:07:20]&#160; hopefully not carried out in chains<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:07:21]&#160; but who knows<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:07:35]&#160; hahaha<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:07:46]&#160; u never know<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:11:37]&#160; what should i put on the Alert ID? number or something descriptive? really dunno where it will impact<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:11:49]&#160; on the guide it says a name.<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:12:31]&#160; doesn't matter<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:12:35]&#160; whatever you want to call it<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:12:47]&#160; it can be "super galactic flying sheep" if that's what you fancy<br/>[27-Jul-2010 14:13:01]&#160;

If you arent doing a new daemon, then the xmlrpc way is more correct. Thats why we pointed you at zensendevent yesterday since it does that exactly. You can either use it as is or do it like the dev guide example is.<br/>[28-Jul-2010 12:25:32]&#160; yeah that's the user pass<br/>[28-Jul-2010 12:26:44]&#160; cgibbons, thanks, you pointed me yesterday to zensendevent, but, is it a python class, or what is it?<br/>[28-Jul-2010 12:30:52]&#160;

it you can send events from a shell script with it.<br/>[28-Jul-2010 12:41:29]&#160; does zenoss 3 support device dependencies now?<br/>[28-Jul-2010 12:42:17]&#160; mducharme-laptop: no<br/>[28-Jul-2010 12:42:26]&#160;

oh, argh, maybe we didn't do it that way, this is trickier then<br/>[28-Jul-2010 14:36:40]&#160; I can adjust our mysql module to not set a password if it's being installed on the zenoss host<br/>[28-Jul-2010 14:36:44]&#160;

so the first run a) populates a zopedb, then b) sets up the mysql db using "zenoss:zenoss" as the user/pass<br/>[28-Jul-2010 14:39:42]&#160; you could have a look at the first run script and see if your automation couldn't patch in a diff user/pass somewhere, or insert some dmd script to adjust it along the way<br/>[28-Jul-2010 14:41:45]&#160;

hello all<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:11:09]&#160; hi<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:11:18]&#160; is there a way to get Zenoss to send info messages to one address, warning to another, error to another without creating users for each and alert users per user?<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:12:04]&#160; QubeZ: you can create a dummy "alerts" user, and then in each alerting rule you can specify a different email address<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:12:24]&#160; thats what i've done<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:12:35] * Simon4 does that also<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:12:40]&#160; yeh, create 3 different alerting rules with different filters<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:12:45]&#160; then set the "Address (optional)" field<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:12:51]&#160; and you'll get exactly what you're asking for<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:13:14]&#160; i just set the email when i create the user, dont&#160; need to set optional field then right?<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:13:33]&#160; YES, BUT, you're asking to have emails sent to 3 different addresses<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:13:38]&#160; meaning don't set the email for the user<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:13:43]&#160; set it per alerting rule instead<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:13:45]&#160; understand?<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:13:54]&#160; weird that in firefox 3, i can't get the little gear icon to drop down options but in safari it works<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:14:09]&#160;

oh i see what you mean, got it<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:15:45]&#160; and repeat for the third alerting rules as well<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:15:49]&#160; rather then 3 users, one user with 3 emails<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:15:53]&#160;

like when i tried to do the whole operational interface status thing through the performance template and my voice gateways generated 4000 e-mails in about 90 seconds<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:33:04]&#160; to my whole team<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:33:09]&#160; that was awesome<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:33:20]&#160; :D<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:33:41]&#160; for a while our test zenoss box was set up to not send email just by having postfix turned off with chkconfig<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:33:49]&#160;

I deleted it, they both disappeared<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:37:08]&#160; i suppose in those instances i'd override the inteface template for the data circuits and let it inherit the others<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:37:16]&#160; still, i'd prefer some better method<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:37:17]&#160; I can no longer delete it because it says it does not exist, but I can no longer re-create it because it says it exists<br/>[28-Jul-2010 15:37:34]&#160;

about the fact that you can put html in a summary?<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:14:58]&#160; If you're running the install as root there's no reason why su should even need a password<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:15:08]&#160;

very odd<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:17:32] &lt;_rain_man_&gt; I've tried the gui way on SUSE KDE and the terminal way both as root<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:18:21] &lt;|rt|&gt; no issues here with Ubuntu 10.04...other than the cron job not running due to some issues with the .bashrc file that zenoss puts in the zenoss home directory<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:18:21]&#160;

all there is to it<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:22:41]&#160; and make sure you're grabbing the appropriate file for your system<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:22:46]&#160; the stack installer should end in .bin<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:22:56] &lt;_rain_man_&gt; that is correct<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:22:58]&#160; and you should grab 32bit or 64bit version depending on what your server is<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:24:01] &lt;_rain_man_&gt; I think i'll just use the virtual app<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:24:08] * rmatte shrugs<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:24:18]&#160;

rmatte I think it's better to add the repository and let apt-get install the stack<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:25:19]&#160; the error you got just means that the installer was finished and was trying to start up zenoss<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:25:22]&#160; so the install is done<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:25:26]&#160; you just need to start zenoss<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:25:27] &lt;_rain_man_&gt; but I get an error towards the end of the installation<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:25:28]&#160;

Otherwise you don't get any mails.<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:53:41]&#160; fragfutter: i will be setting them now based on what Simon4 said which is to set alerts with count=2 if i want it to only email me when it hits that high<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:54:13]&#160; QubeZ: and why multiple?<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:55:17]&#160; fragfutter: because im under the assumption that i'll need one alert for cpu util and one for interface util<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:55:20]&#160; not true?<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:55:46]&#160; QubeZ: not true. unless you want different conditions when to send mail<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:56:44]&#160; fragfutter: i guess im not clear on how to construct the alert then because cpu and ethernet util are separate components that i want to alert on<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:56:50]&#160; QubeZ: a rule like event_state=new, production_state=production, severity&gt;=warning, count&gt;2<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:57:13]&#160; QubeZ: and then you get mail for any component that fails (and is in production)<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:57:21]&#160; rmatte, dude!, it works!!!<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:57:34]&#160; I'm very happy :D<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:57:46]&#160; rmatte, thanks a lot!<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:58:16]&#160; fragfutter: oh i see but lets say a warning is set (count=1) for threshold exceed, then it clears... count is set back to 0 right? so if I have something bouncing alot between polling cycles, i'd never know?<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:58:29] mrayzenoss is now known as mray<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:58:40]&#160; QubeZ: yes<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:59:06]&#160; QubeZ: or you remove the count rule and get a mail everytime...<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:59:07]&#160; thats scary but less likely i'd assume<br/>[29-Jul-2010 09:59:52]&#160; JonnyV, I'll try and I'll let you know about it<br/>[29-Jul-2010 10:00:47]&#160; great chachan .. i will too.. cheers<br/>[29-Jul-2010 10:00:48]&#160; QubeZ: you can also remove the count rule. Instead turn on a delay for your alerting rule. So if something just shows up and goes away it won't mail you. But one-time events that are still there after delay will mail. Or it shows up and the working operator acknowledges it, if he is faster then delay, again no mail, etc.<br/>[29-Jul-2010 10:01:47]&#160; fragfutter: i like that better<br/>[29-Jul-2010 10:02:41]&#160; thanks man<br/>[29-Jul-2010 10:03:13]&#160; also the issue where graphs were not showing up, i remodled the device and now they're back<br/>[29-Jul-2010 10:04:49]&#160; nevermind, after i leave that device and come back to it... graphs are unselectable again<br/>[29-Jul-2010 10:05:32]&#160; that sounds sub-optimal.<br/>[29-Jul-2010 10:07:49]&#160; strange thing, my IpInterface(30) shows grey because I have a few interfaces unmonitored but the ones that are up and monitored are not showing graphs.

is there anything in zenoss like nagos flapdetection ?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 07:21:54]&#160; nagios*<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:35:24] fOrsberg is now known as forsberg<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:46:22]&#160; I've been wondering too, because I've wanted to start using it<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:46:29]&#160; (flap detection)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:48:14]&#160; tehhobbit: not currently<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:48:29]&#160; what exactly does the "flap detection" script do?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:48:46]&#160; (I know what a flap is, I'm just asking for specifics)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:48:55]&#160; if a service goes repeated down and up it will be flagged as flapping<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:49:10]&#160; for flapping services you only get _one_ notification<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:49:14]&#160; I see, yeh, there's nothing like that<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:50:04]&#160; typical notification is, "service down", "service up", "service down", "service flapping", .... wait ...., "service no longer flapping", "service up"<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:50:25]&#160; so its more then one mail, but at least not a hundred ;)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:50:28]&#160; by service you mean for an interface?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:50:39]&#160; anything nagios can check<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:50:49]&#160; I see<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:50:52]&#160; process running, interfaces, cpu load, ...<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:51:09]&#160; it only checks every 5 minutes anyways, pretty hard to determine something is flapping in that amount of time<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:51:35]&#160; rmatte: nagios explains its flap detection in detail (default also checks only every five minutes)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:51:39]&#160; also, I'll point out that all of those events auto-clear, so you can always just set a repeating time on your alerting rules<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:51:56]&#160; so if the alert is still around in 15 minutes, send another email<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:51:58]&#160; sort of thing<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:52:05]&#160; rmatte: thats not the goal.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:52:24]&#160; thats repeating, same feature in nagios.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:52:38]&#160; I don't see why you'd be getting a hundred emails in the first place is what I'm saying<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:52:45]&#160; Zenoss increases the event count and groups events<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:52:51]&#160; so I don't see how that's even an issue<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:53:05]&#160; say something goes up for five minues, then is down for five minutes, then is up....<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:53:21]&#160; good morning everyone<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:53:31]&#160; zenoss would send "its down", "clear", "its down", "clear", "its down", "clear", ...<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:53:50]&#160; if i place a delay on the alert rule i would get nothing<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:54:30]&#160; fragfutter: I didn't mean delay, I meant repeat time<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:54:57]&#160; rmatte: that is if a service stays down it tells me every hour (or so) that it is down, still down, still down.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:55:04]&#160; right<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:55:05]&#160; rmatte: different issue<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:55:14]&#160; so you just don't want to get an email every 5 minutes for each state change<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:55:30]&#160; rmatte: reset, start discussion over.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:55:44]&#160; I understand what you're saying<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:55:53]&#160; rmatte: nagions approaches things as if it's still the same dedupid being treated<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:55:53]&#160; no, there's nothing like that built in...<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:56:16]&#160; where in zenoss' case it would be a new dedupid, thus hitting a new alert<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:56:34]&#160; but it's definitely something I've looked into writing after the dep code, if it didn't exist<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:56:41]&#160; with the altenating up-down service i will describe what nagios does and then what i want to have in nagios.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:56:59]&#160; fragfutter: I understand, you don't need to re-explain<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:57:18]&#160; you want it to identify back to back ups/downs as "flaps" and create a "flap" event instead<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:57:37]&#160; nagios sends: service down, service flapping, clear. And nagios displays a service as flapping in the webinterface even if it is up while i look at the interface<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:58:01]&#160; so you need to do two things, the event handling and a third state of a service (flapping)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:58:09]&#160; it's probably possible to hack it into zenoss by creating a generic event transform under event manager, but yeah, haven't poked at it..<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:58:30]&#160; well, doing it with an event transform won't add the gui component that he's talking about<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:58:55]&#160; rmatte: true enough<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:59:15]&#160; but I'm going to try steer clear of anything zope and web-component related for as long as possible ;)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 08:59:15]&#160; or you need to create a new event type flapping that get's generated if a service is changing state more then N times during the last X checks and a clear event that fires if Service is up for at least Y checks<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:01:43]&#160; fragfutter: what do you have that flaps that badly?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:02:47]&#160; currently nothing ;) it's a feature of nagios that i relied on monitoring a heavy loaded webserver farm. Flapping machines got kicked from the balancer pool<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:03:15]&#160; failovers were too expensive to have them often.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:03:28]&#160; I see<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:04:16]&#160; it's more a "if zenoss can do everything nagios can do and more, there would be no more reason for nagios to exist". and world domination is the goal for zenoss, isn't it?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:05:49]&#160; zenoss is already better than nagios in my opinion :P<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:06:49]&#160; rmatte: i can configure hardcore detailed nagios checks faster and easier then in zenoss.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:07:07]&#160; and for me nagios is totaly deterministic in the behaviour.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:07:31]&#160; who was asking about ramdisks with wmi again?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:07:48]&#160; no ramdisks with snmp was it i think<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:08:02]&#160; maybe ..<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:08:37]&#160; rmatte: have zenoss remodel something at night and zenoss might stop monitoring something if i forgot to lock it. But the autodiscovery and modelling is the zenoss feature i want<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:10:01]&#160; fragfutter: turn off automatic modelling .. you can run it manually from cron<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:10:07]&#160; fragfutter: that's why I don't do automatic modelling :P<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:10:39]&#160; and it was ramdisks with snmp<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:10:48]&#160; or manually if you know a change ..<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:10:53]&#160; QubeZ was asking about it<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:10:59]&#160; but it was a net-snmp problem<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:11:02]&#160; not a Zenoss problem<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:11:24]&#160; yeh, our customers tell us when they change stuff<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:11:29]&#160; so we only remodel when necessary<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:11:59]&#160; rmatte: still there is more magic in zenoss (the reason i evaluate it). nagios is just less code and simpler and i went through it in detail so i understand it completely.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:12:16]&#160; rmatte: well, in my case, I've got 7 remote networks to care about to make sure their edge devices are available and routable etc<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:12:44]&#160; fragfutter: I don't see how you can say it's harder to customize nagios than Zenoss... Zenoss supports Nagios plugins :P<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:13:00]&#160; erm, I meant harder to customize Zenoss than nagios<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:13:04]&#160; (in terms of flap detection)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:13:18]&#160; yeh, but that's a very specific usage case<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:13:30]&#160; perhaps<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:13:31]&#160; I'm sure if you filed a feature request it would eventually be implemented<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:14:04]&#160; but that's something that a lot of networks people would like to have and they'd instantly swap to zenoss from nagios (well, quickly, not instantly necessarily) if they could<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:14:07]&#160; I personally like actually seeing the times when interfaces go up and down<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:14:10]&#160; even if they are flapping<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:14:16]&#160; makes it easier to troubleshoot the issue itself<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:14:18]&#160; rmatte: and it probably could be managed via a transform etc ..<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:14:31]&#160; rocket: no doubt, but he wants a UI component<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:14:32]&#160; rmatte: well, you'd still see the things either way<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:15:02]&#160; but having things indicated as "it's flapping" can tell you the difference of shouting at your provider, or looking for hardware faults<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:15:03]&#160; frozty_sa: I doubt they'd swap until dependencies are resolved<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:15:32]&#160; yeah well, Simon4 and I are discussing and fiddling at that ;)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:16:05]&#160; I really want to see dependencies implemented<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:16:12]&#160; manual dependencies at the very least<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:16:20]&#160; me also<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:16:27]&#160; It would make a whole world of difference<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:16:28] * Simon4 will be playing again in the weekend/tonight<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:16:34]&#160; cool<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:17:54]&#160; rmatte: i have/had a perl script that accepts three parameters balancer pool, node, instance, i need to add all permutations of this to check (111, 112, 121, 211, 113, 131, ... in total i had 72 checks), i can whip it up in nagios in 60seconds by editing a config file.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:19:37]&#160; rmatte: but on the other hand i needed to edit a config file vor every new server i added, not just stick it in a class and if it has a webserver, the server get's monitored, if not, this is ignored<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:26:53] mrayzenoss is now known as mray<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:34:00]&#160;

MIHAJLO: maybe the default community can read basics, but is not allowed to access the interfaces?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:43:28]&#160; MIHAJLO: yeh, you either have the wrong SNMP string set in Zenoss or you don't have the devices configured for SNMP<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:43:31]&#160; it's one or the other<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:43:43]&#160; like with public you can get the administrator of the device and the location but nothing else<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:44:29]&#160; i would check running an snmpwalk manually<br/>[30-Jul-2010 09:46:12]&#160;

and in the past it had oddly enough on a different zenoss install that I did<br/>[30-Jul-2010 12:42:55]&#160; it's included in the ZenPacks RPM for RPM installs, but most people use the stack or VM and need to add it<br/>[30-Jul-2010 12:43:05]&#160; ok<br/>[30-Jul-2010 12:47:40]&#160; should I remodel all the devices after installing it?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 12:48:02]&#160; yeah<br/>[30-Jul-2010 12:49:02]&#160; I'm getting much more info, but presumably since the ssh user I'm using is non-root I'm not getting a list of running processes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 12:49:09]&#160;

it takes 15 minutes to start seeing that info<br/>[30-Jul-2010 12:56:42]&#160; also, process monitoring most definitely does not require root<br/>[30-Jul-2010 12:56:48]&#160; I think the process monitoring just doesn't work<br/>[30-Jul-2010 12:56:52]&#160; someone dropped the ball on it<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:00:23]&#160; I'm also not getting cpu statistics<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:00:27]&#160; I would assume it needs like 15 minutes?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:04:40]&#160;

the default snmp config file has paranoid security settings<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:11:28]&#160; you need to edit it to allow the read only string to get all info<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:11:31]&#160; rather than limited info<br/><span>[30-Jul-2010 13:12:18]&#160;

should cisco multilayer switches go into /Network/Switches or /Network/Routers/Cisco<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:28:49]&#160; because they do routing as well<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:28:55]&#160; mducharme-laptop: I made my own class of /Network/Switches/Cisco<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:29:02]&#160; and copied the template from /Network/Routers/Cisco<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:29:23]&#160; mducharme-laptop: you'll have to do lots of customization, the base templates aren't all that great<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:29:39]&#160; mducharme-laptop: Zenoss is more of a framework/blank slate more than anything<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:30:05]&#160; it already does more than we had before<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:31:11]&#160; it does do a lot, but be prepared to learn how to design performance templates<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:31:17]&#160; the guy who runs the network is pulled in too many different directions.. he was managing nagios/cacti/smokeping/phpsyslog/apstats<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:31:34]&#160; a smokeping pack for Zenoss would be nice<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:31:40]&#160; he would do updates on boxes but not have time to fully do the research on whether the upgrades were compatible<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:31:57]&#160; so he would upgrade php on the cacti box and cacti would be broken<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:32:02]&#160; nice<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:32:02]&#160; and we would have no graphs for weeks<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:32:32]&#160; he had too much stuff to manage and not enough time to do the research before upgrading things<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:33:14]&#160; with zenoss there should be no excuse, because he is only upgrading one system<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:33:31]&#160; yeh, it still requires a lot of testing beforehand though<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:34:30]&#160; yes.. but doing system updates on one box is simpler than doing system updates on 10 different boxes.. we have zenoss running in a vm too so can just snapshot or backup the vm before upgrading<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:34:52]&#160; yeh<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:34:53]&#160; something goes wrong, we revert<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:35:00]&#160; well, I have Zenoss on 14 different boxes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:35:01]&#160; :)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:35:10]&#160; that's different heh<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:35:41]&#160; it's quite the setup<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:36:14]&#160; i put my cisco pix in /network/router/cisco and enabled snmp on it.&#160;&#160;&#160; using snmpwalk i can get info from it&#160;&#160;&#160; but zenoss is persistant about the snmp agent being down in alerts.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:36:36]&#160; the other good thing about zenoss here is that we can get more of our tech staf using it<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:36:47]&#160; citrus2: easy fix<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:36:54]&#160; at the moment our service desk staff have access to the network monitoring tools in nagios/cacti etc but they don't know how to use any of it<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:37:09]&#160; citrus2: go to zProperties for the device, change zMaxOIDPerRequest from 40 to 20<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:37:15]&#160; network documentation is in text files in subversion<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:37:42]&#160; rmatte,&#160; thank you.. can you explain that?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:37:47]&#160; what does it do<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:37:59]&#160; citrus2: Cisco PIX and ASA are picky as hell about the size of the SNMP packets being sent to them<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:38:02]&#160; is it possible to get zenoss to store actual full cisco configs<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:38:11]&#160; and Zenoss tried to cram more in than snmpwalk does<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:38:15]&#160; ahh,&#160;&#160; sounds like cisco<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:38:15]&#160; tries*<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:38:42]&#160; mducharme-laptop: no, you'd want to use something like rancid for that<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:38:52]&#160; mducharme-laptop: we use ziptie, but it's a dead project now<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:39:17]&#160; we have something called ccm<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:39:21]&#160; was developed in houes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:39:23]&#160; er in house<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:39:26]&#160; but it broke 3 months ago<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:39:30]&#160; and nobody has time to fix it<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:39:35]&#160; so we hav enothing now<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:39:42]&#160; man you guys need to hire some IT<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:39:56]&#160; mducharme-laptop: check out rancid<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:40:06]&#160; ziptie is good, but it's been pretty much wiped off the face of the earth<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:40:15]&#160; I plan to setup a site to host what remains of it<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:40:22]&#160; but I haven't gotten around to it yet<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:40:28]&#160; citrus2 the problem is the guy who custom coded this is the guy who runs the network<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:40:34]&#160; I was quite disappointed at ziptie going away<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:40:46]&#160; since he coded it he's the only one who knows how it works, and he's the busiest of all of us, so things get tied up with him<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:40:47]&#160; jmp242: I'm going to try to dig up the source from somewhere too<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:40:53]&#160; jmp242: and host that to encourage a fork<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:40:55]&#160; he's the only one who knows how to configure nagios/cacti/etc<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:41:06]&#160; we weren't monitoring all hosts because he was too busy to add some in there<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:41:07]&#160; jmp242: I have every binary that was available<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:41:15]&#160; so I'm still not getting any performance graphs at all and its been running for like 30 minutes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:41:18]&#160; now we are monitoring everything with zenoss, and it's much simpler<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:41:31]&#160; MrWGW: then you have a genuine problem<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:41:35]&#160; also I'm not getting any inormation about disk space usage other than the size of each filesystem<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:41:43]&#160; Well, I never did end up using ziptie as it didn't work with our Procurves<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:41:45]&#160; MrWGW: this is with SSH?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:41:48]&#160; yes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:41:51]&#160;

yes, unless you have specific local configs on those<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:51:52]&#160; so. if you changed one setting&#160; for a specific host.. do all of the settings become unaffected when you edit the config properties for that class? or just that one setting is static?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 13:52:19]&#160;

MrWGW: Yes, we upgraded all the VM versions to support the hot add<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:06:57]&#160; so I have to hex edit the disk (somehow) and change the hex at a specific offset<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:07:14]&#160; ok well<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:07:19]&#160; I don't know how anyone missed this in a release - as it affects the Server line too :(<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:07:22]&#160; the system didn't collect the correct information in this case<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:07:28]&#160; jmp242: lame<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:07:32]&#160; where I tested it against the server that the other box was successfully polling<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:07:44]&#160; so that means there has to be something fucked up on this zenoss server<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:07:48]&#160; MrWGW: configuration issue somewhere then<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:07:51]&#160; pardon my anglo saxon<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:08:08]&#160; so it's modelling the disks initially?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:08:14]&#160; but not actually monitoring them afterwards?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:08:14]&#160; the weird thing is that when I intiially configured the two servers I did it in the same manner<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:08:23]&#160; that's what it looks like<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:08:28]&#160; and it never gets the used bytes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:08:29]&#160; strange<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:08:48]&#160; I'm rather ill today, I'm very tempted to pay someone to just go in there and fix it and tell me where I screwed up<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:08:52]&#160; yeh, it sounds like the modeller plugins are working fine but not the collector plugins<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:09:04]&#160; should I perhaps restart zenoss?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:09:05]&#160; lol<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:09:10]&#160; worth a shot<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:09:13]&#160; oh wait<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:09:21]&#160; you installed that ZenPack but didn't restart Zenoss afterwards?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:09:25]&#160; no<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:09:34]&#160; that could be my moment of epic n00b fail<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:09:38]&#160; I installed it via the web GUI<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:09:46]&#160; yeh, restart zenoss for sure man<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:09:55]&#160; oh man<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:10:01]&#160; for very basic packs with just performance templates you don't usually need a restart<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:10:01]&#160; it all comes down to a reboot<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:10:12]&#160; but for things like collector plugins, daemons, and whatever else, you do<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:10:27]&#160; ok<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:10:30]&#160; so that was me being a n00b<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:10:35]&#160; indeed<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:10:40]&#160; fortunately I didn't have to pay anyone to clean up my mess in this instance<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:10:55]&#160; that would have hurt to pay someone to reboot it<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:10:58]&#160; If you'd go to the ZenPacks section in the UI you'd see a message complaining that the pack is broken<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:11:04]&#160; meaning you need to restart Zenoss<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:11:06]&#160; well it would've taught me a lesson<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:11:08]&#160; note by the way<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:11:20]&#160; I am an independent businessman and I do managed hosting<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:11:24]&#160; so yes, I'm one of those morons<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:11:35]&#160; but basically when I get stuck on something, if I don't have time to fix it myself I do hire people to do it<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:11:48]&#160; however usually I fix stuf myself<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:11:56]&#160; :)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:11:56]&#160; I am also really good at fixing servers that are down<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:12:08]&#160; and I know how to do BGP routing and I have my own IP addresses and ASNs<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:12:11]&#160; well if you need help rebooting anything&#160; you can hire me :)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:12:27]&#160; actually right now I'm looking for a relief network engineer<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:12:41]&#160; I have to travel to Europe in a few months and I'm looking for a guy to monitor the networks while I'm in the air<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:13:09]&#160; primarily a Cisco guy<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:13:21]&#160; and preferrably someone in the Los Angeles area<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:13:24]&#160; yeah i only ever got my ccna<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:13:29]&#160; not very far in cisco stuff<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:13:37]&#160;

I know a lot about BGP but less about the ibgps<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:14:04]&#160; other than OSPF, which I use internally<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:14:12]&#160; my main area of weakness in Cisco though is QoS<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:14:17]&#160;

big mistake<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:14:52]&#160; lol<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:15:00]&#160; yup<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:15:10]&#160; in those few seconds it sent me like 8,000 emails or something<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:15:24]&#160; holy balls<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:15:43]&#160; there's a lot of debug stuff when you first add devices and they get modeled<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:16:20]&#160; alright I restarted zenoss<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:16:24]&#160;

I am now getting performance graphs<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:17:19]&#160; but I'm still not getting filesystem usage information<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:17:20]&#160; woot!<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:17:28]&#160; hrm<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:17:36]&#160;

It sends 3 emails<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:42:36]&#160; QubeZ: yes, I just explained why that is<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:42:46]&#160; hrm rmatte<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:42:48]&#160; that isn't working<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:42:51]&#160; QubeZ: SNMP is reporting 1200, the RPN value is changing that on the fly when graphing<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:42:57]&#160; now it is printing threshold of operational satus exceeded<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:43:01]&#160;

rmatte: ok thanks<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:43:30]&#160; mducharme-laptop: did the code turn red when you saved it?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:43:37]&#160; yes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:43:45]&#160; mducharme-laptop: then you have a syntax error somewhere<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:43:49]&#160;

hey guys<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:49:30]&#160; actually I'm getting filesystem usage information now<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:49:33]&#160; it just took it awhile<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:49:45]&#160; chachan: hmmm nope, looks like it's hitting the end of your script<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:49:52]&#160; so the only thing I'm not getting right now that I need is monitoring of memory<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:49:53]&#160; it's weird, because it works without dmd, I'll try anyway<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:49:55]&#160; chachan: check your code, something is funky for sure<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:49:56]&#160; I'm getting CPU performance graphs<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:50:03]&#160; and I'm getting filesystem usage information, ut I don't see anything about memory<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:50:08]&#160; other than under the hardware tab, it says how much I have<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:50:32]&#160; Ok, I will fix the arguments by hand<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:50:41]&#160; zenoss.cmd.linux.memory is in the collector plugins list however<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:50:46]&#160; MrWGW: It sounds like you didn't push changes to the collector so it's taking it a while to figure out what it should be monitoring<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:50:52]&#160; go to the device page for the device<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:50:53]&#160; avoiding "getopt.getopt"<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:51:00]&#160; and do: manage -&gt; push changes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:51:34]&#160; and then presumably wait like 15 minutes for it to poll everything?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:51:48]&#160; I guess the push changes would be needed after remodelling the device following installing the ssh monitoring plugin?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:53:10]&#160; well, this is why you push changes...<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:53:23]&#160; the collector only comes back and asks zenhub to tell it what it should be monitoring every hours<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:53:25]&#160; hour*<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:53:30]&#160; so you either wait the hour for it to do that<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:53:31]&#160; how do I not get it to say "clear" in the email when it comes back up again<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:53:35]&#160; or you force it to push the changes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:53:50]&#160; because it's somewhat redundant to say CLEAR: device interface (description) is operationally UP<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:53:50]&#160; so remember to push changes when you change the way a device is monitored or add a new device<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:53:58]&#160; ok good stuff<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:54:07]&#160; now I'm not yet seeing any performance graph on memory utilization<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:54:13]&#160; mducharme-laptop: that's easy, just modify the email template in the alerting rule<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:54:15]&#160; the only perormance graph I have is on cpu utilization<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:54:21]&#160; I take it I sho uld just wait like 15 minutes or so?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:55:13]&#160; mducharme-laptop: go to the alerting rule itself, then go to the message tab<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:55:22]&#160; ahh cool, thanks<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:55:27]&#160; np<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:55:35]&#160; you can change the formatting of the messages there too<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:55:47]&#160; rmatte, I created a user... I receive no password by email... As admin I reset password. I receive 3 emails from zenoss with passwords but none of them work.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:55:50]&#160; %(whatever)s can be added to show any event properties<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:56:01]&#160; cool.. I think what is there is good enough<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:56:03]&#160; rmatte, 3 passwords/ 3 emails<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:56:06]&#160; for now anyhow<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:56:07]&#160; 3 emails with one click<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:56:18]&#160; zaoul: why don't you just explicitly set a password for the user rather than "resetting" it?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:56:59]&#160; go to the user, type in the new password, confirm password, then fill out the admin password in the password confirmation at the bottom and click save<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:59:30]&#160; zaoul: basically, you're clicking the wrong button<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:59:36]&#160; you should be clicking save, not reset password<br/>[30-Jul-2010 14:59:53]&#160; now I just need to figure out the best way to determine the importance of interfaces<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:00]&#160; Ah, Yes that works!.. more so I was confused by it wanted the admin password<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:01]&#160; to specify their importance<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:07]&#160; some interfaces it doesn't matter if they are up or down<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:12]&#160; others it does<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:18]&#160; mducharme-laptop: yeh, that's one thing they need to add as a feature, the ability to "tag" objects<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:19]&#160; rmatte, but still It seems there is a problem with it does not send a password out when the user is created<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:27]&#160; which could be used for severity or type<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:27]&#160; rmatte, and when resetting the password it sends three emails<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:40]&#160; b/c we are an isp and we have home users and important enterprise customers<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:50]&#160; if health canada is down we want to know right away<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:50]&#160; zaoul: it's not supposed to send the password out, do that yourself<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:00:57]&#160; but I do not care whether bernice sanderson is down<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:01:05]&#160; if she does she will phone us<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:01:06]&#160; lol<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:01:11]&#160; zaoul: you're the one setting the password so you obviously know what it is<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:01:37]&#160; mducharme-laptop: yeh, that's why we have interface description prefixes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:01:39]&#160; actually on the subject of memory<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:01:44]&#160; even on my system that was otesnily working normally<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:01:45]&#160; mducharme-laptop: for instance, UVxx is a user port<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:01:48]&#160; there are no memory performance graphs<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:01:52]&#160; whereas IOxx is an infrastructure port<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:02:00]&#160; rmatte yeah the dificulty here is the interface descriptions can only be set in the SU's<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:02:07]&#160; andunder status, in the component type box<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:02:10]&#160; there's no entry for memory<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:02:11]&#160; mducharme-laptop: ah<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:02:16]&#160; so I think I need to tell it to monitor memory more closely<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:02:21]&#160; is that possible with ssh monitoring?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:02:28]&#160; or would I need to go snmp for that?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:02:35]&#160; there is no ability to set the description at the AP side, you can only read the description<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:02:47]&#160; so we would need to manually telnet into several hundred ip's to set descriptions<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:03:02]&#160; MrWGW: do not worry about that component box<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:03:11]&#160; MrWGW: the values you see in there are completely hardcoded<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:03:24]&#160; it doesn't mean something isn't monitored just because it doesn't show up as green in there<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:03:26]&#160; so what about adding a perormance graph for memory?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:03:46]&#160; I think memory isn't supported via SSH, we ran in to this same stupidity the other day with someone else<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:03:59]&#160; it's supposed to support it, but it doesn't<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:04:00]&#160; really man, SNMPD is much much more flexible<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:04:06]&#160; SNMP*<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:04:06]&#160; oh this is bitterly ironic, I finally got it working and it can't monitor memory :-p<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:04:20]&#160; I monitor all my linux boxes via SNMP and it works fine<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:04:30]&#160; well I can do that in this case<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:05:22]&#160; the only question is, could I perhaps add a performance graph for memory by telling it to poll the "free" command?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:05:26]&#160; because that's all it needs to do really<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:05:33]&#160; and I was under the impression that zenoss was somewhat extensible<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:05:47]&#160; It's definitely possible<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:05:54]&#160; read up on configuring your own SSH commands<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:05:59]&#160; and building performance templates<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:06:06]&#160; the question is, would it be easier to do that vs. just switching to snmp?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:06:11]&#160; it's a pretty basic skill to have when using Zenoss, so you'll need to learn it sooner or later<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:06:22]&#160; easier to switch to snmp<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:06:34]&#160; plus snmp can do process monitoring properly as well<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:06:42]&#160; and it monitors other stuff like disk IO<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:06:54]&#160; can I just push out a standard snmpd.conf to all my servers, change the device class, remodel and push changes?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:07:00]&#160; and of course set the snmp community string<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:07:01]&#160; yes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:07:09]&#160; I pasted you an snmpd.conf file to use<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:07:11]&#160; twice<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:07:14]&#160; oh did you<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:07:19]&#160; yes<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:07:20]&#160; much to my chagrin I missed that<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:07:30]&#160; I have a nasty cold this morning<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:07:34]&#160;

I would also like to monitor mysql btw<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:09:00]&#160; I found a zenpak called mysql ssh monitor<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:10:30]&#160; I really have to get these dependencies working somehow<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:10:49]&#160; I just got 3 emails, that mooselake router, mooselake switch, and mooselake ap are down.. mooselake router is the only important one<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:11:03]&#160; you can still use the MySQL monitor in conjunction with SNMP monitoring<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:11:22]&#160; the mysql monitoring would require ssh in either case presumably?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:11:26]&#160; MrWGW: eugh, I'll just repaste the config, I can't find it for the life of me<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:11:40]&#160; rmatte: I'm almost darn certain you didn't paste it, becasue I've been scrolling for it also<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:11:55]&#160; if its any consolation, I once imagined an entire cab of servers existing in a datacenter<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:11:58]&#160; that actually didn't<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:13:51]&#160; I pasted it way back but it's beyond by scrollback buffer<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:13:54]&#160; I know I pasted it twice<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:14:52]&#160;

rmatte: can i pick your brain on something?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:21:05]&#160; Simon4: yeh, though on an secure internal network it's not that bad<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:21:17]&#160; Simon4: it would obviously be stupid to run it over the internet unencrypted<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:21:20]&#160; rmatte: in my world there's no such thing :)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:21:27]&#160; I'd like to create a multi-graph report, that would show, for each site, bandwidth utilization, one graph, per site, with every circuit at the site on the graph<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:21:41]&#160; except, not every interface at a site, uses the same interface template right?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:21:46]&#160; now on syscontact<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:21:46]&#160; Simon4: :P<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:21:56]&#160; does that have any bearing on how zenoss does alerting?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:22:02]&#160; twm1010: correct<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:22:12]&#160; can i simply set the graph definition for both 64-bit and 32-bit and it will display only the relevant ones?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:22:31]&#160; twm1010: I'm honestly not sure, I've never tried what you're attempting<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:22:51]&#160; MrWGW: none<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:23:03]&#160; MrWGW: that will just show up in the contact field on the device status page<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:23:11]&#160; you see why that would be useful right? a nice consolidated report by site, showing what the WAN links are doing<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:23:13]&#160; MrWGW: it doesn't affect monitoring/alerting<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:23:17]&#160; its the mix that makes it complicated in my brain<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:23:30]&#160; twm1010: oh definitely, I just don't know if it's possible without some development work<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:23:36]&#160; twm1010: you'll get "missing rrd file" for the ones that are missing... but then what network devices do you have which don't support 64 bit counters?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:23:53]&#160; rmatte: I figured as much<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:24:01]&#160; even our cheapest ciscos support em<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:24:06]&#160; but I wanted to make sure that zenoss didn't do anything cute like automatically send alerts to the device contact<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:24:10]&#160; Simon4: well, the interface type decides whether to use which template ot use<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:24:19]&#160; Simon4: Wouldn't the question be "What network interfaces do you have that don't support 64bit counters"?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:24:33]&#160; and the answer would be, a lot<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:24:42]&#160; rmatte: hmm<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:24:48]&#160; MrWGW: nope, nothing cute<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:24:55]&#160; a single point to point T1/Serial interface uses ethernetCSmacD<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:24:58]&#160; all our linux/bsd/cisco/juniper ones do<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:25:13]&#160; twm1010: ahh :)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:25:20]&#160; but a multilink comprised of two will be a PPP_64 and default to ethernetCSmacD64<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:25:28]&#160; twm1010: you could cheat<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:25:35]&#160; cheating works :)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:25:50]&#160; and make both templates have the same DS names, which means in a multi-graph report you could refer to the same datapoints<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:26:04]&#160; You know, I thought about that<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:26:06]&#160; vs inOctects and InHCOctects, which is what yo uget by default<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:26:18]&#160; under trapsink and trap2sink I presumably change the IP address to that of the zenoss box?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:26:20]&#160; right, and then just go rename the existing RRD's and I'm gravy<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:26:27]&#160; I wonder why they chose to separate?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:26:27]&#160; twm1010: yeah<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:26:40]&#160; it's "clearer" in a pure sense<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:26:46]&#160; but less useful in your world<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:27:12]&#160; maybe the RRD create for the two is a little different?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:27:20]&#160; it's not<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:27:41]&#160; but it's certainly more technically correct to have the two different names<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:27:42]&#160; mray: any thoughts on that?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:28:09]&#160; Simon4: maybe, but why? all you care about is what's the utilization?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:28:20]&#160; they are separate because they use different datapoints<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:28:32]&#160; twm1010: I dunno - I'm just brainstorming reasons why it would be different :)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:28:32]&#160; they use different sources, but store the same value<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:28:32]&#160; and it's just cleaner<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:28:44]&#160; though I admit the interface template system could be improved quite a bit<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:28:45]&#160; right, two different OID's but you're asking the same question<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:28:50]&#160; it's kind of stitched together right now<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:28:58]&#160; it should be more intelligent/dynamic<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:28:59]&#160; it's just the way it is.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:29:09]&#160; but oh well, maybe down the road<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:29:53]&#160; hrmm...<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:29:58]&#160; twm1010: sorry, was working on something else.&#160; What's up?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:30:21] * rmatte is afk for a few<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:30:21]&#160; was curious, why ethernetCSmacD and ethernetCSmacD uses two different datasource names?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:30:23]&#160; twm1010: basically the datapoint name follows the mib description<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:30:37]&#160; err, ethernetCSmacD64<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:31:24]&#160; Ah... well perhaps I will adjust it then, I see why it was done then to match the MIB, but I really don't care what the MIB says. I want bandwidth to be a common datasource name across any interface so I can combine the graphs of anything together<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:32:00]&#160; twm1010: yeh, that'll work<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:32:09]&#160; and yeh, it is just a name<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:32:16]&#160; perhaps you should look at the data source alias feature.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:32:32]&#160; cgibbons: does that work for multi-graph reports?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:32:39]&#160; I thought that only worked for performance reports?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:32:40]&#160; i think it was specifically created for such.<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:32:48]&#160; think, no first-hand knowledge<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:32:54]&#160; I'll take a look<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:32:57] * Simon4 has never met that feature<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:33:02]&#160; time for some more reading :)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:33:26]&#160; well, I don't see anything about them in the admin guide<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:33:57]&#160; maybe it's just burried<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:34:33]&#160; where is the alias added tho?<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:34:38]&#160; looks like that was new as of 2.5.x<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:34:49]&#160; I see in a datasource where an alias is added, but not where to manipulate those<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:34:57]&#160; it was present in 2.4, but only worked with the CPU report<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:35:09]&#160; it was supposed to be supported in other performance reports by 2.5<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:35:38]&#160; I do see it here already tho<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:36:05]&#160; hold on, I'm finding the documentation for you<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:36:06]&#160; just wait<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:36:07]&#160; oh I see<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:36:22]&#160; the aliases for the 64 bit template is set to "inputOctets__bytes"<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:36:24]&#160; I've not used it, I just know it's intent is all about normalization :/<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:36:29] * Simon4 wonders if it's set for the 32 bit one<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:36:32]&#160; it is<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:36:34]&#160; i see it here<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:36:43]&#160; that might address my immediate concern, let's find out :)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:36:44]&#160; let us know if htat works in a report<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:39:08]&#160; mhmmm<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:39:10]&#160; This report uses data point aliases. (For more information about data point aliases, see "Data Point Aliases" in the chapter titled Core Monitoring.)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:39:22]&#160; yet there is no "Core Monitoring" chapter anywhere<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:39:24]&#160; It won't let me add the datasource<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:39:32]&#160; heh<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:39:43]&#160; it doesn't like the underscores<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:39:56]&#160; it's expecting datasource_datapoint<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:40:01]&#160; and the alias has two underscores<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:40:04]&#160; I found a similar stupidity the other day, I can't remember what it was, it referred to some non-existant section<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:40:14]&#160; someone really needs to go through and proofread the documentation<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:41:19]&#160; rmatte: we always take documentation tickets :)<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:41:27]&#160; i guess it's expecting there to be one underscore acting as a delimiter<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:41:50]&#160; mray: I don't have time to personally read through it end to end<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:42:04]&#160; no, I just meant when you notice things please point them out<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:42:20]&#160; mray: yeh, I forgot the last one, I'll remember to point this one out<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:42:24]&#160; our doc writer is pretty diligent about updating the contents, she's just not a subject matter expert<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:42:38]&#160; I suppose these aliases are used by the aggregate performance or bandwidth reports<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:43:08]&#160; twm1010: yeah, the aliases are used so you can compare apples and oranges, ie. WMI data with SSH data with SNMP data<br/><span>[30-Jul-2010 15:44:36]&#160; aliases are in this doc: </span><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="DOC-3908.html">docs/DOC-3908</a><br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:47:18]&#160; oh cool, and you cna put the RPN in there too, to manipulate it ahead of time before the graph definition<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:47:21]&#160; that will save me time too<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:51:15]&#160; Ah, but I'd still have to rename the datasource to get what I want<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:51:20]&#160; because the alias is on the datapoint<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:51:23]&#160; not the datasource<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:51:48]&#160; since the two templates have two different datasource names<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:51:50]&#160; blast!<br/>[30-Jul-2010 15:52:56]&#160; in my data sources (WMI, WBEM, SQL) i have extend alias concept little bit.
